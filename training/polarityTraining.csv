This is one super cool cafe/lounge.  They serve coffee, cocktails, and some quick bites that can go along great with your drinks.  There are several rooms you can choose from to sit and relax.  Art decor surrounds this stylish joint and just had a great time here sipping on coffee and chatting with a friend who recommended this coffee shop to me.  I noticed a younger adult crowd here but it doesn't matter.  Wi-Fi friendly, too!~~#~1
Lots of "gay on gay" homophobia here.  Hick bars in Alabama are more gay friendly.  Staff and owners know this but they do not seem to care.  Oh well~~#~0
I hired Property AZ to rent my upside-down home in North Peoria (stuck with the house so we rent it out), they are very experienced and had great customer service.  I have had bad experiences in the past with management companies not taking care of the renters or getting back to me.~~#~1
This review is mainly for the bar and a few light (ok not light, but small) snacks.  Met with a couple people during their soft opening and there was absolutely nothing soft about it.  I got there a few minutes early and posted up at the bar to grab a Manhattan.  This drink is usually my boozometer when I am trying a place first.  Ok, we've got something here, this drink is tasty.  Started talking to the bartenders and got a really comfortable feeling from them.  When was the last time that you sit down to the bar and  they ask your name, tell you their's, and then shake your hand?  After the manhattan the rest of the group showed.  The bar was a little too busy to fit the three of us so I took my second drink, sazerac, to the table.  Sazerac was tasty as well.  Rest of the table ordered some drinks and nothing negative to be said anywhere.  We each had around 4 or 5 drinks and every last one of them was delicious.  We were comped a few bar snack and all were delicious but the stand out was the warm nuts. (twss)  Mixed nuts warmed with Herbs De Provence and a little bit of chili flake I believe.  Soooooo good.  As for the style of the place it is fantastic.  Feels cool but not cliche.  The Palomar staff did a fantastic job of designing this space.  As of now this is the one place in City Scape that is worth while.~~#~1
Pita Jungle is now one of my favorite places to go for dinner. It's both affordable and healthy. Thought it's usually  crowded with "Hipster" ASU students, I have yet to receive bad service. Our food has usually come out in a timely matter.As for the environment, It's very nicely decorated with art from local artists and it's very well lit.  It's nice and open so you can see what's going on through out the restaurant. It's never to noisy, so it would be a great place to take a family or even a date.Almost every visit, I've always gotten either the Broiled Chicken Salad or the Lavosh Shawarma Wrap. The chicken has always been moist and dish is always flavorful. The lemon vinaigrette dressing is almost good enough to drink!  Though I have not tried a lot on the menu, some of the food they bring out always make me say "Ooh, what's that?!"~~#~1
Not that you can compare Firebird to anywhere else in Az but I have been to Joliet Raceway in Chicago (and even though that's newer) I like the arrangement of Firebird and the availability of the different tracks available to race on.First off...  NHRA... come on... hands down one of THE coolest events in Az ever, next to NASCAR and well pro any sports but the 8000hp cars come only once a year.  The pits are setup nice so every ticket gets into the pits to check out the teams and cars, beer and food are expensive but what else is new.They also have drag racing events, any type of racing event, drift, road, moto races, dirt bikes, monster trucks, top fuel drag boats on the lake... I'm sure I'm missing a lot but nowhere else has this in Az.Parking is always good to go... driving out of there just takes a while as you've got one main road that you get on to funnel onto the I-10 but not much they can do about that.Great place... keep bringing in the NHRA and letting us use the road tracks for our motorcycles and I'll be happy.~~#~1
Teresa S. and I were one of the lucky ones to win tickets to see Cavalleria Rusticana and Pagliacci last night at the Symphony Hall, and we were impressed with the acoustics. The overall sound quality of the live act was fantastic, so overall I'd say that the gig was pretty amazing.It's a fabulous hub of culture, but the food concessions need some urgent attention. The only munchies they have are desserts like cookies or pies, so be sure to have dinner first.One of the great things they offer is you can now pre-reserve your intermission drinks.You can pre-order your favorite libation before the show, and they will have them ready on the refreshment table. That would save you time in case you need to whiz to the loo, and not have to wait in line again to buy your drinks.Thank you again to Yelp and Arizona Opera. The show was wonderful.~~#~1
So I just called to book a class for me and a friend from a Groupon we bought. The classes for the next 2 weeks were all booked :(. I called and spoke to a very pleasant Paul who said they are extending this offer for a month. Yippee. You rock and we can't wait to try our hand at this exciting craft!! Huge props for Great customer service!!~~#~1
This restaurant has the best Italian food I have ever ate in my life!!! Definitely one of the best restaurants in AZ. I had the sautéed calamari for an appetizer, and an amazing dish for dinner with red snapper and pasta. Their bread also melts in your mouth. Blown away by the service. Gilda was my server, and she was amazing. Everyone was super nice, professional, courteous, and sooooooo hospitable. I've never had service this good at a restaurant other than at Cafe Poca Cosa in Tucson. SERIOUSLY. AMAAAAAZING restaurant!!!!!~~#~1
A must!  One of the BEST dog food stores in the Valley!  Great service and quality, natural feed products for your dog.   You can rest at peace knowing that your pets are in GREAT hands.Mark Siebelhttp://www.doggiestepsdogtraining.com/~~#~1
Easy 5 star fun at the Phoenix Zoo. I've never seen critters so closeup before. At the Monkey Village, they don't even have cages. The giraffes came right up to us. I spent half my beer money on fishheads and shrimp feeding the stingrays. It was a blast!We had great time!yow, billPS - I've never commented on other people's reviews before. But jeez. When someone goes to the zoo and complains about the cost of a hot dog or a snow cone... well, for spider monkey's sake, get a clue!~~#~1
Great place! I've been coming here for quite some time now and every time I received excellent customer service. The servers are always friendly and attentive.I LOVE the sushi there. They have a lot of fun, new rolls that are unique to Bamboo Grille. The spicy sauce they put on the rolls gives them a great kick too.Recently I've noticed that the place has looked a little unfinished with random stuff here and there. Baffled, I asked a server and was informed that they are in the process of remodeling. Needless to say I'm excited for the newly designed Bamboo Grille!~~#~1
They say you never forget your first.  Well, Postino Central was my first Postino and I remember my first sip and bite like it was yesterday.The atmosphere here is very sexy at night.  Candlelight and sexy music add to the already chic ambience Postino has.  The food?  Bliss.  I can still remember how the creamy ricotta and sweet figs on my bruschetta tantalized my tongue that first night.  I can feel the velvety red wine at the back of my mouth and drizzling down my throat.  Parking is a bit of a hassle, but they have valet for a reason.If you're stuck waiting for a table, squeeze in at the bar and grab a glass of wine (or three).  People watching is almost as fun here as eating.  Now that there is a Postino in the East Valley, I am hoping Postino Central will get a little less busy... if only to serve my selfish purposes.  I love everything about this place and I hope to be back soon.~~#~1
IHOP is barely a step up from Denny's in terms of boring chain food. Last night was the first time I ever had dinner there, and it tasted like squishy, mushy cardboard. The food took forever even though there were only three tables in the place with customers.The reason I gave it two stars instead of you is because the breakfasts are pretty good. I don't mind them except the omlettes which are way too oily. The coffee is almost bad, but the waitresses always look happy.[update April 2, 2011]Why'd I go back? I hate this place now. We went today for the first time we have all had a chance to go out together for breakfast. I was excited to do this and was eager. I should've stayed home.My wife got a waffle with her combo that was cold, tasted like cardboard, and was crunchy. The bacon my wife and child ordered was burnt, crispy and did not look like bacon at all.My sausage (I always upgrade to turkey sausage since the regular pork kid here is vomit worth) was totally cold. I sent it back and complained. I think she microwaved my plate. Their coffee is always burnt so I got an iced coffee. She said they had Mocha, Vanilla, or Hazelnut. I asked if they just had a regular coffee flavored one... she said yes, and brought me disgusting hazelnut (glad I'm not allergic!!)Ok now it's three hours later. My daughter laid on the floor whining about how bad her stomach hurts, I've been to the bathroom twice and my wife is asleep because she said if she didn't lay down, she would puke. Seriously.The management (district managers) really need to care enough to read YELP.  They remodeled the outside of this place and, I guess, spent all their money to make it look pretty so we'd forget they serve dogfood.~~#~0
This is what I love about Phoenix, you find these little treasures where you expect them the least!Loved everything about the place. We had a team dinner in one of the rooms and it really felt like we were having dinner in someone's dining room. Super cute atmosphere, loved the pictures from all over Europe. I has the vegetarian rellenos (sp?) and my mouth is still watering just thinking about it. We also had the only malbec they have by the bottle and it was delicious!!~~#~1
Does anyone know why their regular subs are $1 more than all the other Jimmy John's? Or is that just when it's delivered, instead of charging a standard delivery fee? I've noticed that with the other types of sandwiches too, and extras...the slim is $4 instead of $3.25, and extra avo is $1.75 instead of $0.75That's not going to stop me from ordering though :-) Still love their sandwiches...they make the best veggie sub I've had. They load it up with veggies, whereas I have to ask for extra everything at a certain other sub chain and then they still barely put any on. I'd much rather pay a little bit extra for Jimmy John's :-)~~#~1
everytime my sister comes to town we go striaght from the airport to Karsh's.our intent is to buy bagels and we do, but we can never stop there and wind up with a variety of goodies. all that we have comsumed over the years has been really great. as for service, always with a smile and friendly attitude.we used to go here all the time when we lived on n. central, but since we moved to the other side of the world it has become a special occasion place. so please open one near us too.~~#~1
I took a cooking class with Chef Eddie Matney (Eddie's House Restaurant) and his recipe called for Vanilla bean olive oil from the Olive Mill. First off, what he made with this recipe was phenomenal much thanks to that smooth vanilla olive oil in there! I decided to google this place only to find out that Chef Beau Macmillan acclaimed a the kalamata sandwich from there as his "bad boy favorite." I don't know what a bad boy favorite even means but it has to be good especially since I've had his food and was quite impressed. I decided to make the 45 minute drive from Scottsdale out there on a Sunday afternoon to get my olive oil and try this kalamata sandwich. Such a cool atmosphere inside. It's like a trader joes/gift shop/paradise bakery all with a rural, kinda on the farm feel. You could easily kill an hour here just looking around at all the stuff for sale.  I couldn't believe the kalamata sandwich! If you go there and order anything else....you're wrong. Freshest ingregients I've ever tasted. I feel like the pork could have just been butchered 5 minutes prior to me ordering it and the vegetables just picked from their garden (which they do have there). Pretty cool how you can sample the endless flavors of olive oil there. Got myself the vanilla bean and the blood orange as well. Make for some unstoppable pancakes. Tried the gellato and wasn't all that impressed. But in all due fairness, I'm not exactly sure what real gellato is supposed to taste like since all I've had is gelleto spot and grateful spoon.Definitely worth the drive! Great place to bring the family.~~#~1
This dairy sells fresh milk, straight from the cow.  That's what they're licensed to sell.  They use organic feed (dried grasses), hydrogen peroxide for cleaning certain things, and iodine to clean the cows' teats (just like many dairies used to).  They want the cows to be out on pasture, but they need a bigger piece of land to do so.  If you know of a piece of land in the area, please suggest it to Jackie Calamos.  I love their milk.  As of this date, milk is $10/gallon, the true cost of the milk (or maybe even a little low).  Most of the milk you buy in the store isn't worth the price.  Forcing more production out of cows with hormones comes at the cost of quality (and your health).  SYD's has all the good stuff (the proof is in the taste).  It's never made us sick, and we've been drinking it for 2 years.  It's a miracle that this metro area actually has a dairy willing to sell fresh milk to the public!  Thank you, Save Your Dairy!~~#~1
I've been to several local dermatologist and havent seen results or been fond of any; the staff is extremly friendly and very helpful! I highly reccomend this dr, he is knowledgeable & helped me attain the results I was looking for!~~#~1
Great movie theater----staff so friendly!!!    If you love movies and comfy, clean theaters at reasonable price, check it out!!!!    Parking so easy and close as well.~~#~1
Other restaurants have come and gone but this one has been there like what my wife said about 20 years existing in the area. Congratulations!!! I loved the old recipe sourdough pizza. I enjoyed it very much. Neighbors please help our local business survive. We need them to support our local community.~~#~1
I can summarize this in one word.  YUCK!  We went for dinner/supper, which is part of the problem.  We ordered t-bone steak and chicken.  The salad bowl had a hole right through the plastic and the steak was way thin.  We ordered it medium and any steak that thin just ends up being cooked as "well done" anyway.  Everything comes with grease dripping hash browns whether you want them or not.  At least the staff was friendly enough and food (if you call it that) was served quickly.  My personal recommendation is that if you're not going to eat breakfast, go somewhere else.~~#~0
This is how Caribbean food should be done.  Excellent jerk chicken, perfectly cooked plantains, very good patties.  I highly recommend this place if you are at all a fan of Caribbean food.~~#~1

I came to the restaurant specifically because of a recommendation. I am now on a gluten-free diet and have other allergies so, suffice it to say, I don't get to eat Italian often. However I was told that they have gluten-free pasta and other choices. I was initially impressed by the sheet that breaks down their meals by allergen so that one knows what is safe. Kudos on that. This is more than most places provide.However, they have Basil Pesto Sauce listed as NOT being gluten-free nor soy free. Finding that odd, I asked the waiter to confirm with the chef, and I was told there was no wheat product at all in the pesto, which seems correct. (I did not ask about the soy, but I would wager that sneaks in somehow thanks to the cheese.)So I ordered the Create Your Own Pasta of gluten-free penne with pesto sauce, shrimp, peppers, spinach, and mushrooms.When my bowl of pasta arrived, it had all of the above. However, it also had onions, zucchini, and eggplant, yet I had to dig to find a shrimp. I originally assumed I had somebody else's order.The waiter, who was wonderful and attentive, took the bowl away and offered to replace it as I ordered. I would have eaten the original bowl, and told him so, but I was more concerned, as I said, that it was someone else's.As a side note, if these flourishes of extra vegetables are an example of a cook's flair, I would say that if a customer orders a straight menu item, that might be acceptable. But when I fill out a cute little checkbox form with what I want on my Create Your Own Pasta bowl, I *only* want the items I checked off.A fresh bowl arrived later exactly as ordered. Except the pasta was undercooked. I don't mean really firm al-dente. I mean some were still way under done. Now, I know that gluten-free pasta takes longer to cook, and they probably rushed the bowl to get it to me. But that bowl was almost inedible.The waiter did offer to get me a third bowl. I declined and soldiered through it. We were having dinner out for my wife's birthday and I did not want to belabor the meal. The waiter then offered us dessert to make up for the problems. Though I did agree to this, and I'm not demanding or even asking for a full dinner cost to be covered, it seems inadequate for management to offer me a three dollar dessert to make up for a twice-failed $14 dinner.  I do not intend to go back.~~#~0
Dr. Farnsworth is the Jam.I had my first ever eye exam, and she was kind enough to take good care of me. She did a complete, and thorough eye exam, and explained each test, and the importance of them.After the exam, we determined, that I indeed needed glasses. At that point, my prescription was handed over to the very sweet optician who took care of me and let me try on about a dozen different frames before I found the winning pair.I've sadly lost them in Vegas, but I will soon be back to buy my next pair so that I am not blind as a bat.LOVE YOU GUYS!~~#~1
Wow this place was steps below horrible. I should have known better considering the place was empty on ASU game night. The food was greasy, and flavorless. Everything on the plate was flat... Ya I said it.... Flat. Bland, disappointing food. Save your money and eat at taco bell. You will thank me later.~~#~0
Second to worst dining experience of all time.Our waitress was a little timid, which is fine, but it we shouldn't have to wait 20 minutes just to order our food.  Our food took 45+ minutes to arrive, and while our friend's steak came out hot, our Hibachi Steak and Potatoes were room temperature.  Sent it back to be warmed, they offered to pay for it, which is great.  Both managers came and said hi and apologized for the slow cook staff, and made sure everything was great. That was the last we saw of them for the next half hour.  We finished our meals, and 10 minutes later, had to flag down a different waitress to go and find our waiter, and to bring us cheesecake menus.  We always get the Dulce de Leche, but they brought us terrimisu or some junk.  I gave it back to the waiter (after walking the restaurant to hunt him down) and said "no thanks, I'll just pass on the cheesecake."  He looked surprised, and later said we didn't have to pay for that cheesecake.  Well I'd sure hope not!Two hours of my life are gone.  I usually like this restaurant, but tonight's service disaster will prevent me from EVER going to this location again, free food or not.~~#~0
Hands down the best Vietnamese food we've found in metro Phoenix.  Enormous bowls of delicious pho, served quickly with friendly and efficient service.  Our "go to" place for pho now.  Cheap too!~~#~1
Really, if I could, I would give this place zero stars, because it is a disgrace. If you need an emergency vet in the Scottsdale/Paradise Valley area, go to Sonora Veterinary Specialists on Cactus/40th St.(http://www.sonoraveterinaryspecialists.com/). It's also 24/7, but unlike VCA PVEAH, it is a truly valuable, legitimate facility, and it''s staffed by engaged, committed, deeply caring, and extremely knowledgeable and skilled personnel. At SVS, you and your pet are treated well and what you pay is fair and justified.VCA is the opposite of SVS in every single way. VCA is, in fact, the WORST of corporate animal service providers. The space is small, cheap, cramped, and the staff are indifferent at best and don't convey any genuine love of or concern about animals in pain or distress. All they want is your money. They do NOTHING for the $99.75 they charge for an "emergency exam." We essentially paid that amount just to be given an astronomical estimate, literally nothing more--our dog was the exact same bloody, traumatized mess we gave to them when they gave him back--after making us wait nearly an hour without ANY communication).  Furthermore, they tack on bogus surcharges ($5.25 for a "biohazard waste fee") that are irrelevant to the "service" provided, and their drug prices are absurd--$8 for a single Tramadol tablet, anyone?Conversely, our (and our dog's) experience at Sonora Veterinary Specialists was wonderful (even in the context of an emergency), and the cost was ultimately significantly less.VCA is a money-grubbing, depressing, sham.~~#~0
Outstanding and fantastalistic comes to mind. Real good.~~#~1
You don't expect to find a good restaurant in a strip mall, next to Costco, but Upper Crust is all of that. They have fantastic food, including fresh made mozzarella (made at the restaurant), really good chicken wings (ask for them crispy!), and, yes, great pizza. There's always a happy hour special going on and the bar and restaurant sides are totally separate, which is great for both families and the no-kid crowd. And, now, that it's cooling off, you can finally enjoy the patio!~~#~1
From the outside you wouldn't guess the kind of school it is - its in a strip mall, its small, not very well known - but if you took the chance to come inside and see for yourself you would be very surprised and impressed.  This is by far the best dojo I have ever run across.  You are welcomed when you enter the door, all your questions are asked whether they seem stupid or not. You are treated kindly and with respect from the get go - a very warm place to walk into.  I was so impressed with this place I signed my kids up immediately.  They have so many types of classes and the variety and time schedule they really try and have it work around your family so you have your time as well.  The teachers here are amazing and always do their best to make it the best class you have every time.  I would recommend this dojo to anyone that asks me - and I do.  If you haven't come into this place and tried it or have your kids try it then you should - you are missing out.~~#~1
Believe the hype. That's all I can say. This place is the kama sutra of flavor for your taste buds.~~#~1
I really like this place... they have great wine... try the tasting... it is 10 bucks and you get 5 tastes... they make almost all of the wine in house (i know the almond champagne is not made there)... i have not found any wine that i don't like... my favorite is their porto and chocolate port.the other thing you can do is have a bottling party.  i recently purchased 30 bottles (at a great price!!!  cheaper then the wine stores).  they make the batch for you and then you have a party to bottle and label it.  this is a great and fun different party for you are your friends.  despite it location it is a great place for a date...~~#~1
Truckin' Good Food is by far my favorite part of the Ahwatukee Farmers Market!  So far, I have tried the Veggie crepe and the Bean and Cheese crepe and both were spectacular.  For various reasons, it had been about a month since I had been able to meet up with their tent on Sundays and today I got my fix!Jeff and Erin are both so sincere and friendly, which makes it easy to hang out and chat while your crepe is made right in front of you.  The care and attention put into each and every order really makes TGF stand out from the rest, the fresh, quality ingredients don't hurt either!Next week, I've got to try the PB&J!!~~#~1
Okay, so I admit it. Sometimes I get a stubborn idea about not wanting to go to a specific establishment due to a fierce loyalty to one of it's competitors. It took me a while to cave on this one. Too long in fact.Everyone loves Lux and as it happens, they have good reason to! My latte was supremely delicious. The environment is great albeit slightly confusing as far as the flow of service. I absolutely love the patio area. This place definitely has a Pacific Northwest vibe that immediately resonates with me. The service was really laid back, yet authentically friendly. I was far too busy enthusiastically catching up with a dear friend to take in all that Lux has to offer. There's room in my heart for Lux after all so I shall return. My primary concerns going in were the coffee, service and atmosphere. A+ for all in my humble estimation. I was a little late to the party, but I had a blast anyway.~~#~1
Not worth comin here. I'm all for food like this but this restaurant sucks. They gave me and my dad the wrong meal, and the food was not that good. The meat was dry and the rice was cold. Not worth it.~~#~0
great service, efficient bartender, the place was packed and he flew around that place serving brewski's nonstop...awesome outdoor patio and great view of camelback...happy to see this little gem and will be back~~#~1
The best of all the Harkins. Better array of munchies and really friendly staff. Also, I wasn't overly carded on my inexpensive purchases. At the Superstition Springs location, I'm carded four times between the parking lot and my seat. Chances are...if I steal a credit card, I'm not gonna sit in the same spot for three hours awaiting the po-po.~~#~1
So far, I have been to Lola twice (a Saturday night and Monday morning). Saturday night was very quiet compared to the super busy Monday morning. Free Wi-Fi, coffee, baked goods, and awesome location...you can't beat it. The morning we went, we had a Monterrey Jack scone that was really good. I laughed when I got my latte in a "So I Married an Axe Murder"-esque cup. We sat along the high tables facing Central Ave and I really enjoyed surfing the internet and looking out towards Central. There are various types of seating as well as some outdoor tables. I really loved this place but worry that it will be one of those places that will be so popular, you'll never get to sit there. That is why I stopped going to Lux because it eventually got so crowded all of the time. My favorite part of Lola coffee is being right on Central and watching traffic and the light rail go past. Love it, love it.~~#~1
This place has really good mexican food and a very nice ambience.~~#~1
Finally a place where my kids and I both love the food that doesn't serve chicken nuggets and fries! My kids love Blue Burrito's kids chicken quesadilla, especially the churro that is included. I love their salads and taco plates. The free chips and salsa bar is a big hit with the family. The place is always super clean and the staff is very friendly.  The perfect place for lunch on their new patio now that the weather is cooler.~~#~1
So this is my current Sunday All day Happy Hour JAM!This place is SO GOOD and I'm not a huge fan of all off Fox Restaurants concepts.The Chefs Pizza of the day hasn't let me down yet... We don't even ask we just order it!  The Chefs Board is pretty good too! My fav dish right now is the Broccolini - super simple but it's just so light / fresh and make sure you try the Bucatini & Meatballs if your their for happy hour. Awesome open feel to it - super friendly staff. The bartenders are great - I wanna say the dark haired brunets name was Nicole - works weekends & knows how to make a mean bloodymary / Red Rooster in their case. The parking / Valet situation is a little annoying but remember the sign says "Complimentary" not Mandatory - park your car yourself if you want.~~#~1
We just completed our third tour with Taste It Tours and we've been impressed with all of them.  All 3 tours are distinct and are loaded with excellent restaurants.  I've spent quite a bit of time downtown, but it can be daunting and I haven't ventured much to explore and try new things.  The tours take you to the places you may not notice as you whiz by, give the history (yes Phoenix has history), and overall just slow you down to take in the sights, sounds, and of course, food!Can't decide which tour to take?  Start with the Original, then the warehouse and finally the evening.  Really, they're all good!  Tips: Have a light snack before starting the tour.  Yes you do get a lot of food, but keep in mind that the tours start at 2pm or 6pm.  You have introductions, overview, some history and then a short walk to the first restaurant.  If you're skipping lunch, you might be very hungry when you arrive as the first restaurant.  2) Wear comfortable shoes.  You will be walking about 2 miles.  Nothing strenuous or fast paced, but just be conformable (also wear comfortable clothing as you will get full).  3) Pace yourself!  Don't eat everything that is in front of you.  Each restaurant gives a fair amount of food, now multiply that by 3+ more restaurants that remain on the tour...You get the idea.  You will be full!  Highly recommend for anyone: locals, out of town visitors, guests of locals, team building, etc.  Really, who doesn't like food!Side Note: Taste it Tours was founded by a few Phoenix locals who love food and their city.  They have only been around about a year now and have been doing extremely well.  They base their business around supporting local businesses (local supporting local).  I'm excited to see how well they've done and wish them all the best (More tours are in the works and I will definitely be taking them!)~~#~1
I signed up for Yelp just because of the poor service and being cheated out of money from Cafe Rio. I already voiced my complaint to the restaurant and to their website in writing, however I haven't received a phone call or email back.I've visited this establishment twice and each time I go I receive very little toppings on my burrito or tacos. I understand that it's made to your order like Chiptole or Qdoba, but they'll add very little cheese or toppings on your food, which can cause you to request more. To save myself time and every yelpers eyes from reading this long story, the individual making my tacos was extremely frugal on the toppings on my tacos. She barely put any cheese on my 3 tacos and I simply requested that she could put a little more on the tacos. She did and when I went to pay for my order, I was charged an extra 95 cents for "side cheese." The issue isn't the money because eating at Cafe Rio can be expensive for a fast-food mexican restauant, but it's the principle of charging me extra after I said, "can you please put a little more cheese on my taco." This hasn't been the first time this happened, but a previous visit had the same result with the sauce on my burrito. I thought mexican food restaurants had gigantic burritos and generous size tacos, but Cafe Rio will charge you on top of your order if you don't like their skinny tacos.All I ask for from Cafe Rio to acknowledge that when you add more toppings to what the cook's add to your food, that they say, "this will be extra." They do this at Chiptole and Qdoba, but Cafe Rio would rather screw you over at the end. I will not be visiting this establishment again. As I said, it's the principle as to why they charged me extra for this, not the money.~~#~0
Even though I've only been to Bosa once I've had the donuts from here several times.  My parents have been coming here regularly (like, multiple times a week regularly) since this place opened and every time I come to visit they make sure to get me donut in the morning when they know I'm hungover in bed.Now, I'm only reviewing this place for the donuts.  I didn't even know this place served other breakfasty stuff until I came here myself, but the other pastries & coffee drinks sound good as well.  That being said, when it comes to donuts Bosa is as good as it gets.They're soft, chewy, and all around yummy...that goes for all varieties (well, the ones I've tasted anyway).  Another good thing...they're CHEAP!  It's not like donuts break the bank anyway, but even compared to chain donut places the donuts here practically cost nothing.  The place itself is not much to look at, but who cares!  All I want is the donuts!~~#~1
Surprised this place isn't closed by now. Went here once when I first started going to ASU and never came back.Their ingredients are not fresh, gyro meat tastes old and decrepit. They really need to hire better pita makers who don't resemble drug addicts and derelicts. My pita was falling apart before it was even handed to me. Literally, by the time I got it to the table it was soggy and not even worth eating!~~#~0
I will never know what the food tastes like because they were so so rude, I will not go back.  We came in and were given a table, menus were practically thrown at us.  And then we waited, and waited and waited.  We asked a woman working there, and she apparently did not speak English and indicated a man at the front would help us.  But he was too busy talking.  We got up and left.  No one even said a word when we left.~~#~0
Any parent with young children can vouch for me on this one...keeping the attention of a three year old is, to say the least, difficult. They need constant stimulation, otherwise, there very well may be hell to pay!Enter, the Children's Museum of Phoenix!The facility is an old school, converted into three stories of pure fun and energy! After you pay your standard $11/person older than 1 (or your $22 for up to four people with a Groupon), you encounter a three story art project that can only be described as AWESOME! There are multiple ways in which your children can traverse this mammoth. The various pathways challenge children in strength, balance, and critical thinking skills...all of the ways you want to challenge your child!After your child has lost interest in this room, you progress to the second floor. Here, children get to experiment with a really cool board that can only be described as "Plinko-esque". Here, children can alter the path of a falling object by changing different platforms. My daughter thought I was a genius because I was able to predict where her object would land every time...it's a shame she'll ultimately realize how routine that feat really is.  After Plinko, children can either go to the trike wash, build forts, or they can head to the art room. After some laps through the wash, my daughter wanted to head into the art room. Being that we went right before Halloween, our child had the opportunity to make black play dough (to make spiders), she got to paint on a giant rocket ship, and then she was able to make a spooky tree out of a brown paper bag. Such simple activities...such great opportunities!After cleaning all of the paint from her smock, we made the journey up...to the third floor. Here, children get to play grown-ups. There's a mock supermarket that allows children to either shop, ring up merchandise, or work in the stock room of a miniature grocery store.After shopping, our daughter wanted to work at the little ice cream stand located just outside of the grocery. We had fake ice cream cones and sat at the tiny bistro set while we watched children make their way through the noodle forest. We then made our way to the end of the hall to race miniature race cars on roller skate wheels.Being only three floors, our day at the museum only lasted a couple of hours...but in those short hours, my daughter never stopped smiling!How on earth could you rate any place less than five stars when it brings so much joy to YOUR pride and joy?~~#~1
I found this place completely by accident and it was great!  I have been going pretty much once a week since discovering taco caliente. I love that you can choose from about 4-5 different meats and everything is completely fresh. .... Nothing is fried!  The service is good and the owner always stops to chit chat with me.  The salsa bar is pretty good and the hot is actually hot!  Love it!  Can't wait to go this week!  The only thing is that I wish they were open later but I know they just opened recently.  Hopefully, they'll extend their hours soon. :)~~#~1
Great service! Great Value! Best in the valley hands down!!!! I am a second generation customer and as far as i can remember my mom has always took my clothes here, from my 8th grade promotion dress, my HS prom dress, my college graduation dress and now i take my husbands suits here! Park Avenue has been there for all of my wonderful growing years and hopefully will be here for my future children as well!!~~#~1
My mother always told me, if I didn't have anything nice to say, say nothing!~~#~0
great place to go and the pizza ia great too~~#~1
A couple Saturdays ago, went with my mom to get my name added to her accounts should the unthinkable happen. We first went to Chase which took all of ten minutes. The personal banker was great - in-out-done.  Then we headed to her Credit Union at approximately 10:00 AM. They were quite busy, apparently. When we checked in, I heard grumbling from other customers and asked the wait time.  I was told there were two people ahead of us in line and it "shouldn't be long."30 minutes later, my mom went to ask how much longer it would take. Jennfer, who was manning the reception desk, dismissed her rudely in front of a lobby of customers. My mom is as sweet as tea in Tennesee, so to hear her called out in front of a lobby of people as a disruption was upsetting.  45 minutes later, I went up to ask if it would be much longer. Jennifer said curtly, "We're busy." Apparently, on Saturdays, they're busy and one should avoid transacting business there on the weekend. I don't recall being spoken to so rudely at even a fast food restaurant in recent years...Another ten minutes or so went by (as did my deadline to make another appointment I had made), I was told it would be "two more minutes", as I had to go through their background check to be a member. They were having a difficult time with my Washington Driver License and the weird characters it has (an asterisk in part of the number). After all was said and done, over an hour later, I was approved to be a member and was successfully put as a signer on my mom's account.I asked for Jennifer's card, as I told her I was not happy with the way she had spoken to me or my mother, and I intended to speak with her manager.  To that I received a reply she did not have one. The woman sitting next to her informed me she was the assistant manager and that they were busy on Saturdays. My biggest beef was this: If it was going to be an hour to speak with someone, tell me. I can make other arrangements or come in during the week. Being told first, "It shouldn't be long," and then, "We're busy" is not an excuse. If the business is so overwhelming on Saturdays, perhaps it would be wise to staff more people, extend the hours, or inform people of the wait they're likely to experience because of the queue. Or don't open on Saturdays!As a 20 year veteran of the service industry, I am very disappointed at the level of service Arizona Federal Credit Union provided my mom and me, but also all the other people I watched be dismissed like the Credit Union was doing them a favor. After doing some searching for a new home for mom's money, she can get a much better rate at a (four letter word forthcoming) BANK!I'm normally a big fan of member-owned institutions, but based on the incredibly rude serviced I received from Arizona Federal Credit Union, I'd say go to a Credit Union or Bank where the employees actually read the mission statement that is painted on the wall behind them.~~#~0
One of my fave places in Phoenix.Well stocked and friendly staff.I don't normally peruse the DVDs or CDs because they tend to be pricey,but one day I just decided to take a look.That's when Border's became one of my fave places.I was able to find a fairly rare documentary DVD.I paid 40 bucks for it,but have never seen it offered for sale anywhere before.I very much appreciate a business who refuses to cowtow to the ridiculousness of political correctness.For that alone was well worth paying 40 bucks for.I was even more impressed by the staffer who rang up my purchase for not only being knowledgable about the DVD but letting me know they had a biography of the director of the film that had just come in.Even though the shipment had not been tagged and put on the floor for sale yet,the staffer called to have someone open the box,and bring a copy for me to look at.I bought that too!I will coninue to patronize Borders and any other book store that chooses not to censor!~~#~1
Forget the yogurt and the berry berry bad service. The OCD worker with shadow you and serve you a sample with a glaring stare. You'll never feel so ackward adding your toppings since she'll trail behind you and fix the spoons. Yogurt sucks as much as the service, so I don't recommend.~~#~0
This is going to be brutal.  Hide the children.If you've been to Chipotle, you'll feel right at home at Qdoba. That is, until you start eating. Complete and utter ripoff of the concept, except for the part that matters - the execution.  Where Chipotle succeeds, Qdoba fails miserably.  The ingredients are orders of magnitude shittier.  The burritos are just plain bad..  My burrito was loaded with rice and beans and very little meat - basically the opposite of what you'll get at the "other" place.  On top of that, the rice and beans were the suck.  And if you know Brak, you know that he LOVES his beans.  But not these.  About all they're good for is a massive bean fart shortly after ingesting this crap.If you want to know the root cause of this debacle, check out who the parent company is - it's Jack In The Crack®.  Pretty much explains it all.Avoid at all costs.  Receives Brak's dreaded zero-star review, rounded up to 1 because Yelp doesn't allow a zero.~~#~0
Having spent lots of time in Sonora, Mexico over the years visiting family, I have always sought a place here in Arizona that provides an honest and quality duplication of the food I have had south of the border. At Sonora Mesquite Grill, I have found such a place that makes food on the spot, using only fresh ingredients, and genuine care for your experience. You can always go elsewhere and maybe get your food faster, maybe have a plasma TV in your face, but I'm willing to bet that your food started out frozen and going through a thawing process in a microwave. Celina, the kind and welcoming owner, wants people to receive the absolute best food possible. This painstaking process means long hours for her every day preparing the beef and chicken over a mesquite fire. No, there are no large corporate chain gimmicks or cut corners. Sonora Mesquite Grill simply provides good food at a good price without the use of preservatives and loads of fat. Is Sonora Mesquite Grill for everyone? Perhaps not, but it is a great choice for someone looking for genuinely authentic, modest, great tasting and healthy food with the taste of Sonora. If going for the first time, make sure to order the silky and flavorful guacamole and salsas. Finish your meal with a fresh and homemade razpado to truly cap off a great meal at Sonora Mesquite Grill. Simple and great flavors at their very best.~~#~1
The food was absolutely delicious.  Was very surprised in finding a good Asian restaurant here in Phoenix.  We had the papaya salad with soft shell crab, Phnom Penh noodle soup, and the lehong noodles.  All were delicious and very SE Asian.  I could not believe how great the food was.  But the best part was the grass jelly drink - it brought me back to my childhood.  Can't wait to try the other dishes here.  A definite must try here in Phoenix.~~#~1
I just got back from my first visit ti Jacks All In Social Club. I'll be go back. I found the place a nice place to play a hand or two of Texas Hold'em poker. The owners are nice couple want to provide a nice, clean, and safe place to play poker. They have succeed.~~#~1
When was the last time that you went to a restaurant and were still bragging about your experience two weeks later??? This is exactly what I am doing about the "Arrogant Butcher."I went there a couple of weeks ago with a bunch of folks from work. We had a private dining area and our servers name was Mark. He truly made the experience AMAZING!  His detailed, vivid descriptions of the entrees and desserts were comical and had most of us in tears. You could almost smell and taste each item as he passionately went into detail.  The appetizer- soft pretsels with cheese..OH EM GEE!!!!!!!!  Why doesn't every restaurant have these??? The crab stuffed chicken......AMAZING!We shared several desserts, one which was a peanut butter cup......stand back Reese's......you have competition now!! =)The manager came in later and had a professional, yet funny, manner about him as well.  What a great team they are.~~#~1
Love love love this place!~~#~1
Great eats at this joint. New York strip was awesome! Pear salad was bomb and service was superb. I'll be back march 10th!~~#~1
The Culinary Dropout , you get the best of both worlds. The food is off the hook (it's great) ,the service, these ladie's and guy's take care of your every need, and as a added bonus you have some of the best performers in Phoenix, entertaining you while you dinne.....Check it out....Bluesman Mike~~#~1
I was craving some sweets today and told my husband about this place. Apparently, one needs to make an appointment but my husband made one right away when he called. We got a Baileys cupcake, a chocolate cupcake, and a carrot cupcake all of them were DELICIOUS! Seriously most gluten free pastries are horrible but these were great. We will definitely be going there frequently.~~#~1
Not being a big fan of chain restaurants, I wasnt super excited to eat here last night. I was however, starving and craving mexican food and wanting to try somewhere new so we ended up at Manuel's. OMG I loved it! The salsa's (especially the hot!) the chips, the cheese crisp with green chiles and onions, and most of all: the chilaquiles!! I LOVE chilaquiles so much and had mostly seen them only served at breakfast until I opened up Manuel's menu and there they were, just how I like them! SO good I wouldve licked the dish they were served in if I wasnt so full afterwards!JD had a rolled quesadilla that was fantastic too and we both needed to be rolled out of there when we finished eating. It was so good though that I'm craving it again today. We will definitely be back!~~#~1
This is the only Ben and Jerrys that has successfully withheld the recession in AZ.  This means that this is the only one left as well.  Its located in a beautiful plaza called El Pedregal.  They have live music on Sundays.  I found out this information from the friendly owner who told about the history of the store since I asked him if their location was really the only one open in all of AZ.The location is very North Scottsdale.  I am not sure how it does for business, it is far from commercial areas.  On my drove over, I mostly noticed many well built homes.  This is the only Ben and Jerrys left, and I strongly encourage those who enjoy this ice cream to go out and support their business.~~#~1
They had Kool Aid! i was so happy to see it :)The chicken and waffles were really good... my girlfriend and I went straight there from the airport, before going to our hotel, and it was completely worth it... yeah, waiting outside in 100 degree heat isn't ideal, but for 10 minutes you can deal with it... especially when they had someone outside giving out waterIf you're ever in Phoenix like us, or live out there, definitely stop in!!!~~#~1
PIECE OF **** manager wouldn't put air conditioning on yesterday. It was 90.They just lost alot of business.~~#~0
Postino's is a great date restaurant. Especially on Mondays and Tuesdays when they have their $20 bruschetta and bottle of wine special. You can choose any bottle of wine off of their fairly long list of wines and get a delicious board of bruschetta for only $20. Major win. The proscuitto and fig is my absolute favorite, followed by the artichoke, brie and apple, and salmon and capers. The restaurant has a great interior and patio with a huge wall glass garage door that opens up to connect the interior to the exterior when the weather is nice. If you join their mailing list, you get a free bruschetta board on your birthday and the restaurant's birthday. I also love their sea salt caramel sunday - it's the most delicious dessert ever. You have to try this place. It's just great.~~#~1
This is my current first choice in eateries.  The spring rolls are made with rice paper and such an array of fresh bite sized vegetables, it melts in your mouth, and there are so many different kinds, ave price 3-4.00.  Did I say they are HUGE?  It's a weight watchers dream.  Everything on the menu that we have tried has been delicious and presented beautifully.  The sauces accompanying each dish are always intrigueing and tasty as all get out.  The best thing of all, though, is the Ginger Creme Brule.  Wow, sir.  It doesnt get better than that.  If you like Viet food, Thai food, or just plain fresh, good food, then this Vietnamese restaraunt should pique your interest.  My goal is to try everything on the menu.~~#~1
This wasn't the first time, but we went to Tutti Santi for a family Christmas Eve Dinner.  All I have to say is that everything was simply perfect.  Not only the food, but the service.  Which to me makes a restaurant with great food go from good to great.  I ate the lamb shank- Angello Dorato, which fell off the bone and was delicious. I cleaned the plate. Dad had the veal marsala with fettuccine alfredo.  The veal was fantastic and the alfredo was just right. The sauce was not too thick-not to thin.  Dad cleaned the plate.  From him being in the food industry for 30+years and eating in many italian establishments both here and Chicago, believe me that says more than alot.   Mom had the special of the night, which was a cioppino with tons of seafood.  When most italian restaurants serve this dish at least one of the seafood items will be rubbery or fishy tasting (not in a good way) especially the mussels.  Not here. Everything was the way it should be. I felt this was the plate of the evening out of 3 great dishes.   Mom didn't clean the plate, she has a small stomach.  But I will be eating the leftovers in about two hours after I sleep off my meal.Everything from the bread, the calamari fritti, to the tiramisu was fabulous.  I'm glad we couldn't get reservations anywhere else for this special meal.  Gratzi and Buon Natale.Oh yeah, I didn't get the raviolis this time, but if you've haven't had them it's a must try.~~#~1
Deceptively fantastic. Like Lady Gaga. Pizza A Metro is the Lady Gaga of mid-range Italian restaurants.It's so unassuming from the outside that I was pumped when pulling up. Oh, man, Ben, we could get in a knife fight at a location like this! Sweeet!It's not that bad. But the food is righteous. The pre-meal bread with the tomato + balsamic + red onion deliciousness was such a great alternative to the typical bread and oil. We split the antipasti (yes, the portions are comically large... we maybe cleared a layer (a delicious, delicious layer) of very fresh, yummy artichoke hearts, prosciutto wrapped canteloupe, and a smattering of other favorites. We then had the pizza with sausage and broccoli. Perfect cheese, perfect crust, yum sausage, perfectly crunchy fresh broccoli.It's clean and warm on the inside. Try it. You like it. And tell no one that I mentioned liking Lady Gaga.~~#~1
Hate long lines at the DMV?  Hate dealing with the DMV for any reason? Then you should check out Desert Title Service.  I had a complicated Title transfer and was dreading spending 4 hours at the DMV office the last day of the month but I knew I had to do it.  So today my daughter and I went over to DMV and waited an hour before deciding to call Desert Title Service.  Had I known I could go in to a place with no lines get a title release and a title transfer I would have checked them out sooner.  I called their office while sitting in the DMV and drove over.  In less then 15 minutes I had the title released and the title transferred.  Daughter had new plates and her title in less then 5.  If you need anything to do with your car I urge you to call them and/or visit their office.  You will be surprised at how fast and efficient their office is.  I will never visit the DMV unless I have to.~~#~1
If we were able to give 0 stars... I would ask to give -1.I live nearby, and am sad to see that a coffeeshop that sells coffee this horrible is still in business in my neighborhood.Not only was the breve mocha that I ordered disgusting, so was the process of watching the barista make my drink.They use hershey's chocolate from a dirty nacho cheese style pump with chocolate sauce dripping down the sides, and coagulated into a thick cap at the tip of the nozzle.  *Disgusting.  The espresso shot was made without care, or concern for the fact that it was done way too quickly, and with espresso grounds that were ground way before I walked in the door.  Possibly way before the barista started her shift.   *GrossAnd finally.  The milk.  She steamed the milk with the automatic steam wand.  This was a huge red flag.  Those are notorious for burning milk and making disgusting drinks.  Well, both were accomplished. The steam wand was tinted white from lack of cleaning.  And the worst part was that near the end of the wand was a DARK CHEESE that had accumulated from burning milk and not cleaning the wand after every use. Which is FREAKIN - DISGUSTING.I wasted 5 bucks on an overpriced small mocha, and threw it away after taking a sip.  Hundreds of businesses in the area close down every year, and there are more realty signs in strip malls in this neighborhood than actual storefronts.  AND I really don't understand why this place hasn't joined the many defunct businesses and starry eyed entrepreneurs in the unemployment line.  If you own a coffeeshop.  Coffee should be your passion.  If you own a bait shop.  Fishing should be your passion.If you just want to open up a business that mirrors a nearby popular chain (short, tall, grande), please stop wasting space in the strip mall and get a day job in a cubicle.Never going back, warning my friends about this place, and am probably going to contact the health department on Monday.~~#~0
So my friends and I had to roll each other out of the door after this meal was over but it was sooooooooo worth it!!! BEST red kool-aid ever served in jars!! BEST waffles I've EVER had!! BEST red velvet cake I've EVER had!! I also did enjoy their chicken, mac & cheese and collard greens, but none were the best I've ever had, but very good.  I seriously dream about their waffles and red velvet cake, I don't know what magic mix of ingredients make up the waffle batter but it's absolutely perfect and these waffles would stand deliciously on their own even without butter and syrup, but who'd want to do that? the red velvet slice they give you is HUGE and soooo moist, the frostings is cream cheesy delicousness. I can not wait to indulge in this treat again, but since I'm far from being the only one who loves this place, it is always packed and the wait is long, at least on the weekend. Seriously considering taking a day off of work just for a weekday Lo Lo's run =P~~#~1
The food was decent, however I am writing about their underhanded business practices.I ordered a travelzoo voucher for $69 that included 2 3 course meals. It said "Regularly $140". What we ordered, if had been ordered off the regular menu would have been about $100. However, we were charged tax on the full $140. Second, even though on the voucher it says "PLEASE TIP ON THE FULL VALUE OF THE CHECK." (which implies tip is not included and we get to choose the tip amount) and nowhere mentions automatic gratuity, 18% gratuity (18% of $140, even though we ordered $100 worth of food at the most) was automatically added to our check.Third, even if you had ordered the most expensive options, the highest possible amount it could be worth is $120, not $140. It is mathematically impossible to have the voucher be a $140 value, but that is what they add tax and tip to.Fourth, after we told our waiter we were using a voucher, he seemed less interested in the service level of our table, which i later realized was because he had a guaranteed 18% (of $140) tip.I just noticed today they have another travelzoo deal "$79 - AWARD-WINNING FRENCH DINNER FOR 2 W/WINE, REG. $165", I am posting this so hopefully if anyone is thinking of buying that voucher, they will read this first before they purchase it.~~#~0
Gotta love a place open late in Phoenix. 2.50 petite martinis after midnite; yes please!~~#~1
Love this place.  Buffalo chicken breast on a pretzel bun was amazing. Love the atmosphere too!~~#~1
This review is based on delivery, service and food quality as delivered.Second and last time I will be ordering from this place. The first time they forgot a few items and were very off for delivery time. Tonight I Ordered at 11:03 PM, estimated delivery at 11:50 updated to 11:54 PM (from a whopping 1.5 miles away to add). 11:54 comes and goes. Call them, at 12:07 AM now, I am told they are on their way (1.5 miles away keep in mind). Call back at 12:40 AM to cancel my order as I do not want to eat at 1:00 AM. They actually come to deliver while I am on hold waiting at 12:44 AM. My "hot sub" is ice cold, there's nothing like the taste of cold greasy bacon and chicken close to 1:00 AM on a Monday (now Tuesday) night...if you are going to take nearly 2 hours to deliver this, at least make sure the temperature is somewhat close to where it is supposed to be....never again silver mine...never again.This place probably has a "good taste potential". Unfortunately, like most "hot food" the taste quality substantially decreases the longer it sits...in a fridge, alley, or wherever they decided to leave it for nearly 2 hours. If you feel the need to get food from here..for the love of sub kings please just DON'T GET DELIVERY!~~#~0
This was the marriage of two of my favorite things alcohol and ice cream.  As Charlie Sheen would say "Winning!!!!"I had a groupon so Laura A. and I went to try out this amazing place.  The groupon got us each two scoops so we went with 4 different so we could sample the most possible.  I got the Apple Pie / Spiced Rum and Black Raspberry / Chambord Liqueur.  Both were awesome I actually enjoyed the Chambord the most but I was in ice cream heaven.  Laura got the Mimosa with Champagne and the Margarita / Tequila.  I really enjoyed both of her's the margarita was a strawberry one which is my fav.  The Mimosa was very refreshing and I could imagine that being a great hangover remedy at about 11am on a Saturday =) just sayin.  I have found a new place to cure my sweet cravings and can't wait to try more flavors as the website has many more I didn't see in store so I assume they are on rotation which is great.  I hope that eventually I can find a pinapple upside down cake with rum flavor~~#~1
Old school style butcher shop that has great service and a great selection.  You will pay more, but you can sign up for their emails and get the monthly and weekend specials.  Often there are coupons for BOGO or a few bucks off your purchase.  They also have a good selection of beer and wine, side dishes, and some supplies for home BBQ and smoking.  After reading the other reviews, I know my hubby and I need to try the jerky.  We always enjoy shopping at Von Hanson's.~~#~1
the owner was dishonest, she posted a menu outside with lower pricing to attarct traffic, and then charge higher pricing menu inside. she also charge me 12% sales tax, which is illegal in tempe, which suppose to be only 9.3% very rude manner, not recommended~~#~0
Only reason for 1 star is 'cause I got arrested here for underaged drinking years ago.I blame the Diamondbacks, for no legitimate reason.~~#~0
After flying across the country we were hungry and as I've done in many other cities, I went in search of pho.  I ordered the pho dac biet.  The broth was not oily, and packed with flavor.  The noodles were just right and there was a generous amount of tripe and tendon.~~#~1
Puttanesco pizza (artichokes) was delicious and the service is all very quaint and efficient.. They even have gluten free pizza crust. Happy hr drink is 1.00 off all drink choices which I love since I can order whatever I like~~#~1
What can I say about Execucar. I love their service. It cost just as much if not cheaper than taking a cab for me. I make a reservation on-line, get confirmation via email as well as a phone call the day before confirming my reservation. The cars are always nice, clean, and fresh smelling (yes that may seem weird but I have been in some cabs that were like WHOA!) The drivers are always in shirts, ties, and slacks and they are professional and courteous. I have never had a driver be late (knock on wood) and they have always gotten me to the airport on-time. Plus I get some frequent flyer miles added to my USAirways account for using them. Can we say bonus!~~#~1
Since I have ranted recently on poor customer service, and in the spirit of balance, here is a shining example of how easy it really is.Late last summer  I came home and was shocked to see two of my sunscreens looking quite vandalized. Upon further inspection, it appeared that while using a back mounted leaf blower, one of the landscape crew had brushed against them. The exhaust pipe must have ripped and burned the screen material as well. It was quite the nasty burned melted scar. After staring at it for several hours, I realized there was no virgin Mary, no Jesus, hell it just looked like burned grilled cheese without any deity or lesser apparitions whatsoever, regardless of the angle or my squint. So deciding there was no money to made on eBay, I set out to get them repaired.Did some online searching and decided to call AmeriZona. I explained the situation and was told they could repair them, but I would have to bring them in. These are some pretty large sun screens mind you and packing them into the convertible would have been a challenge.While pondering what to do the person helping me on the phone asked me if I could hold on. I could tell it was one of those thinking on your feet light bulb went off type can you hold requests.She came back on the phone, informed me that she had a crew that was working close by and that she would ask one of the crew to swing by and pick up the screens for repair. She could not promise when they would be repaired, but for that convenience alone I was on board. She had already quoted me the price to repair the screens, and it was very reasonable considering some other online comparisons.Someone showed up within a few hours to pick up the screens. He could not have been more accommodating, and it was obvious this guy had been working all day and was on his way home. A few days later, Mark  phoned me to tell me my screens were ready and to tell me he was going to drop them off on his way home! Needless to say Mark was also very pleasant to deal with. I believe he was at the time the sales manager. When he arrived, the screens looked great, matched the color of the others, even with the sun bleaching over several years. He even offered to put them in! This experience was way beyond any customer service expectations. No extra charges for any of the above and beyond the call of duty efforts. Outstanding, and quite refreshing.~~#~1
They really do a great job, and you will really pay for it. I don't have incredibly pricey clothing, so getting my $50 blouses dry cleaned here just doesn't make sense- but I would absolutely trust them with very important articles (nice sport coats, lined trousers, wedding gowns, blood soaked mattresses... haha, kidding).~~#~1
Old school steak house.  Best 22oz ribeye I've had in years.  Bread drenched in broth was curiously delicous.  Waitstaff hustled.  THe only aspect was the salad, a waste but at Durants, there is so much good meat, why waste it on vegiies!~~#~1
Get your passport, we're going to Mexico.Can't find your passport?  Still waiting for it from the State Department?  No worries, pack your bag and head to the Ranch Market!This place is the best!  The food court is wonderful with so many tasty dishes.  And the produce department is crazy!  2 lbs of grapes for 99 cents, 8 cucumbers for a dollar, 17 cents for a bunch of cilantro, 7 -- YES, SEVEN pounds of watermelon for 99 cents.  You can go crazy with produce and not break the bank.  The tamales are huge and the tortillas, oh the tortillas. Don't be frightened, don't get intimidated, it's just a grocery store people!~~#~1
This place is the best! They stopped doing tacos, but if your lucky! they do have them call before you go! Some outside seating (picnic tables) no seating inside. Take away only.They also have another location!!! Yea! In a strip mall on 51 ave & orangewood. They do serve "tacos" at this location!~~#~1
I came here today for a manicure and pedicure... I have been here quite a few times; it is a place my girlfriends like to come to so when I want to hang with my girlfriends and get a mani/pedi this is where we meet.  Although today I was solo:(.  The ladies here do a really good job; my manicures always last a really long time and they are really nice and accommodating.  Today I had one girl doing my pedicure and another doing my manicure... now that is what I call service!  I was out of there in a hour.  They do not have a tip line on credit or debit so bring cash for the tip.  Today I did not have cash ( i forgot)  they were so nice they said next time I come I can tip then if I want.  I came back anyway to tip them because it was so fast and my nails look great.  Oh another thing I forgot to mention is they use the hot rocks for the massage part for both the manicure and the pedicure and the callous remover is part of the cost of the pedicure.  Total for both services including getting french manicure on toes and fingers was $42.00.~~#~1
Wow!  I enjoyed staying here!  Huge rooms!  We had three adults and two children and everyone had plenty of room!  Highly recommended!~~#~1
I have been here 2x since moving down here from cali bay area. I am a coffee snob and I really fit in here. The staff is very cute and helpful.The people in the shop remind me of the bay area.I drink americanos and the beans being used are very robust and smooth.The menu selection is nice for the food fair and I really enjoy the general atmosphere.I strongly recommend this cafe!!!Donkey-~~#~1
Their amazing prices are instantly countered by despairing customer service.  If I want low prices I will go to goodwill over this place.  Looks like Dillard's is on my list of do not shop.~~#~0
This was by far the worst restaurant experience I've ever had.  I paid $20.00 for a show and dinner. I received the show only because it was from an outside source. The show was 2 hours long and by the time it was over half the restaurant I'd say 50 to 80 people still had not been served. They didn't have enough menu's for people to even order off of. Some guy in shorts walked around with buckets of silverware wiping them on his shorts then placing them on the table. The show started at 7:00, at 9:30 I still had no food. The people who did get food complained that it was terrible. Maybe I should be happy I didn't get any food. When I asked again about our order the waitress said she would take care of it. The guys in the kitchen were overheard saying "f---k those people no more orders! not only did we not get the dinner we already paid for they flat out refused to give us dinner or our money back. We ended up at Dennys eating eggs at 11:00 . Seriously I've never had such a bad experience in my life. Can you imagine paying for a dinner then being refused the dinner or a refund? unbelievable~~#~0
I LOVE this bar. My first visit was in 2004 when it was known as Bar Nun. I'd just moved to AZ and I was drawn in by the neon green light and funny name. Little did I know it was the beginning of a love affair. Since I didn't know anyone yet I went by myself and sat at the bar. The staff was friendly and so were the patrons. Some of the patrons turned out to be a little too friendly, and the bartender, Jennifer, insisted that the barback walk me to my car to ensure my safety. As if that wasn't enough to make a fan out of me, I found out they serve $2 Blue Moons all day Saturday and the food is awesome!The burgers are great, and you can order them rare if you like. I also became addicted to their BBQ chicken sandwich. And the wings. They'll grill them instead of fry them for you which is a bonus. In fact I don't thing there is anything that I have tried and disliked here.Thursday-Sunday night they usually have a pretty decent cover band. Usually classic rock or 80s stuff. They also have NTN and a ton of TVs if you're into sports.I was so in love that when it came time to move from my apartment, I made sure my new house was within walking distance. Not that you'd need to walk, (since half the year it is hot as hell even at 2am I can see why you wouldn't want to walk) they offer a free ride program on the weekends where they'll pick you up and drop you off. That way you don't have to worry about Sheriff Joe and wearing pink undies at Tent City.Wow, I kinda wanna move back now. CK's I miss you!!!~~#~1
Thank God there were some Mesa firemen standing outside this place when I pulled up as my wife was very uneasy about exiting our car and heading in.  Even trying to explain how fellow Yelpers loved it, did not ease her fears.  After a unanimous "Defnitely, it's awesome!" amongst the three battlers of the flame in response to my "Is this place worth going to?", we parked the car and walked on in.  This place is a definite hole in the wall (read: DUMP) and I/we LOVED it!  Great chicken tacos, awesome machaca (shredded beef) burros, delicious chorizo and the tamales were equally spectacular (homemade of course).  It's located in a somewhat dicey area of Phoenix, due west of the airport, but it's totally worth going to.  It has become my new "first stop" after I get off the plane at Sky Harbor.....unless I land too late at night....~~#~1
Have been here twice. Everything is excellent as far as food quality.  It's pretty busy on most evenings and that can slow things down so if you think you might be in a hurry I would recommend something else. Service has been outstanding each time that I have been.  The food is good and they have a reasonably diverse wine lists with mostly national wine offerings. The prime rib is superb. Most meals will cost in the range of 15-30 dollars depending on pairings and w/o drinks. Definitely worth it for a nice night out.~~#~1
Yeah, its BBB....what else to say?~~#~1
Great place for a "home office" morning. One of my favorite places - indoor & outdoor seating. Always busy - they offer breakfast & lunch, their food is awesome! Very generous portions.~~#~1
Best gyro in town! We go for the lunch special during the work week quite often. I havent been for dinner but if its half as good as their lunch gyro then you wont be disappointed. Service is great and they always take good care of us.~~#~1
This is the worst Pizza Hut I have ever been to. I was up-charged for something I didn't order. When I asked for it to be corrected it was done wrong again, given the wrong change and had the drive thru door slammed in my face. Asked to speak to the manager and he was extremely hostile. He took my change, receipt and food. After some time I asked for a refund and was told that wasn't possible, too much paperwork. Asked for his supervisors number and was told he was the highest manager, there was no one above him. Right. I went to the next Pizza Hut and asked for the regional manager number. I left the food at the restaurant because I was no comfortable eating it after he took it back to correct their mistake. Not sure what could have been done to it.The young girl at the window did get it wrong twice, but the example the store manager gives is piss poor and is the issue. I hope Pizza Hut sees who they have working for them and speaking on their behalf because according to this store manager, Tim, he's the owner and CEO of the company. I highly doubt that.~~#~0
I love scallops, and the scallops at The Breadfruit were simply the best. On the weekend, The Breadfruit is open till 11pm and its Rum Bar is open till midnight, which makes this a great late-night haunt: pick your favorite rum drink and share a scallop appetizer for the perfect lite end to the evening. The servers were excellent and handled my gluten allergy easily, offering suggestions and slight modifications to the dishes. The Breadfruit is located at 108 East Pierce, which is south of Roosevelt and just east of First Street. Put this place as a must on your late-night hit list.~~#~1
This place hits everything on my "it's Awesome" list. First off it's a family run little place.Second it's in a hole in the wall area.Thirdly and most importantly it is all made in house. Fourtherly it is awesomeWe were in Gilbert staying at a friend's house for spring training, GO DODGERS!!! We hit the usuals, Waffle House, Dunkin Donuts, Dodger Dogs at the game, and our friends asked do you like sandwiches?If there is one food group that I love, it has to be the Sandwich group, and this place is one of my top 5 sandwiches stops of all time.We ate in the Lounge(y)(ie) area, which has a more adult vibe going on. We first started with their fresh bread, and tomato basalmic vinegar salsa(y) thing. Which was great, we had two rounds of that while we drank our beverages, and waited on our sandwiches.I ordered the Cuban sandwich with the potato salad, and the wife ordered the Chicken breast sandwich, with pasta salad. My sandwich came out perfectly, from the fresh Ciabatta Bread to the outstanding roasted pork. I would order this pork just by itself; it was juicy, and full of flavor, just like my Cuban grandmother makes. While this sandwich is a true Cuban sandwich, not using swiss, and not being pressed, it is not advertised as an actual Cuban, just a Cuban style, like me.Now this potato salad was some of the best I have ever had, and not just because it had bacon, which is awesome, but the use of yukon gold potatoes, instead of red, or russets has been a revelation to me. This is how I am going to prepare all off my potato salads from now on.After all that I still ordered the carrot cake, which like everything else is made in house with local ingredients, it was warm with a not overly sweet cream cheese frosting. The wife got the lava cake with some beer ice cream. Even though I ate most of my carrot cake, and loved it, I wish I had a full gallon of that beer ice cream, it was just perfect. In fact I am planning another trip out that way, just for that ice cream.~~#~1
My husband and I chose Binkleys for our 5th anniversary dinner. We don't usually spend that much on a meal, but for a special occasion we decided to splurge, and we are soooo glad we did. We decided to do the 4 course tasting meal, and with the many amuse bouche's throughout the meal we left so full, I couldn't even finish my wonderful seared foie gras. The atmosphere was cosy and inviting, the wait staff friendly and helpful. The three hours we spent enjoying our meal was well spent. We would both like to revisit and enjoy another taste adventure with this lovely resturant.~~#~1
They have a mechanical bull.  Need I say more?~~#~1
Probably the most serious restaurant for food in Scottsdale.  Great attention to detail from the chefs, management and servers.  Shin does warm up after a few visits - we've been there probably 10 times in the last 18 months.  ShinBay is a must for anyone truly into food.  Given the ingredients - both the sheer number of them and the overall quality I would actually call the pricing here a downright bargain.~~#~1
I've been a patient of PFD for a few years, recommended by a friend, and have always been happy with the attention I've gotten. I actually go to the Gilbert location now, but I have been to the Tempe office once and had a good experience there. It's a family owned business, I think they've been around for 30 years. They have always been pleasant and honest when talking teeth. I wanted to mention my hygienist specifically, Jackie. She is super nice, calm and gentle, which is important to me since I don't particularly like going to the dentist. Check them out if you're in the market for a dentist.~~#~1
i love the army, but they make me wake up wicked early.  then i work, work, work and when lunch rolls around, me want tasty goodness FAST.  mamma mia's is the solution.i got their 2 slice deal, mushrooms.  this cost me $4...that alone makes it rockstar, but you have to ask yourself...does it get any better?!  oh yes, it does!!!  the crust was crunchy, the cheese ooey-gooey and the mushrooms PLENTIFUL, which made me disgustingly happy.  i think pizza places never put enuf mushrooms...today, i met my match.the joint is hoppin, but they still manage to get you out in about 10 minutes.  plus, you get to stare at frank sinatra while you wait (young, cute blue eyes, not the older, less attractive version) and listen to the tv blaring.  and if you are me, the QUEEN of movie trivia, you enjoy your wait as a time to school co-workers in "the Game" while you wait for your AWESOME slices.moral of the story, go, young ones and enjoy.  the food is plentiful and cheap, atmosphere friendly but small.  its easy to miss...KEEP YOUR EYES PEELED!!!~~#~1
Great Great Great salon!! They offer all sorts of services and Karyn, one of the nail techs is amazing! I'm a little obsessive with perfection when it comes to my nails and she does an absolute perfect job! Pays so much attention to detail! She is always creative and can make designs if you wish. She has many many color options. I would recommend EVERYONE to her and this salon!! Plus they won Best Salon in the East Valley!~~#~1
The grooming salon at this location does an amazing job with pets. Yesterday was the 2nd time my baby was groomed here by Chip.  I hope I spelled his name correctly, he's just wonderful.  He's very patient and very kind with my Sushi-poo and I'm comfortable leaving him in Chip's hands.~~#~1
Been here a few times, and each time it it's the best Thai food I have had in Az. Service has been consistently great. Has a full bar with some good specialty drinks that sometimes take some time to make but are worth the wait. Lots of mid day food and drink specials. I've tried six dishes here every one has been excellent. Portion sizes are about on par with the average of the many Thai restaurants I've tried in the east valley, while menu prices are below the average. I think Thai Spices offers a good value for some great food and drink and I can't wait to come back.~~#~1
I'm convinced that anyone giving this airline more than one star is most likely associated with them and is concerned about their job.  I've been flying with them for 7 years back to NC to see my aging mother.  I fly 3X/year on the same flights.  The service and attitude of the employees has been getting progressively worse.  I am also a pilot (20) years and I understand the weather and air traffic control VERY well!  This rant is not about operations, security or delays.  It is about the customer service by pissed off employees.  My wife said that if she was not with me on my last trip she would not have believed what happened.  I forgot to purchase my own bottle of water before getting on the plane in Charlotte.  The beverage service was 2 hours into the flight!  This old, cranky b#$%^ came by and said, "what do you want?"  I said I would like to have a soda and a water.  She said you can only have one or the other.  I was so thirsty I asked for the water.  It was a very small glass that I drank very fast and then ask for a refill...please!  She said, "I told you that you could only have one"  and pushed the cart away.  Even the people around me were in shock.  The check in personal were equally as rude.  If you are watching the internet news, there was an article a few weeks back that rated customer satisfaction and US Airways was at the bottom!  I for one will never fly with them again.~~#~0
i've been eating at bison witches for 7 years now.  i started in tucson when i went to UA, and even though this one is on ASUs campus, i'll go because the food is that good.i almost always get the soup and sandwhich combo - the sundevil (in tucson its the wildcat) and the cream of brocolli soup.  yummm!!  they give you plenty of soup in a bread bowl, and if you're like me and like to dip, they give you the top of the bread bowl that they cut off.  they also give you the insides of the bread bowl too!  as everyone else has said, the sandwhiches are huge!!  you could order just half a sandwhich and be good, but you would be missing out on some deliciousness.  and you get all this food for just $7.75 (when i first started eating here, it was only $6.50, which was perfect for the poor college kid).i've also had their chicken cheese nachos, which is a cafeteria tray filled with tortilla chips, covered in lettuce, tomatoes, queso and cubes of chicken.  it's an appetizer, but could definitely serve as a meal for 2.also tasty their chili and chili con queso.  yummm....~~#~1
Best Subway anywhere. Super-friendly staff and always really clean!~~#~1
Our family made the mistake of dining here on Thanksgiving. Everything from the table to the food to the clueless and absent waiter was outright below average and certainly no where near the kind of restaurant described in the other reviews (which I wonder now if were written by the owner or manager). What a disappointing holiday.~~#~0
I have visited a few nail spas in Scottsdale and I like this one the best. ;)  They do the best work and they don't rush.  The environment is clean and well decorated.  They don't try to pressure you to get little designs on your nails. (At least, from my experience). If you want to chat, they'll chat. If you want to zone out and enjoy your pedicure, they'll let you. Just try to book your appointment in advance. They have availability for walk-ins sometimes, but your best bet is to secure your own spot.~~#~1
I have been to a great many Ross store-- and I can safely say that this one is my favorite. Even when it is busy, it is still manageable, unlike some of the others. I am also consistently pleased with their selection. Now, I often go in there without much of a purpose, just to see what's there-- but I recently found ALL, that's right, all of my Christmas gifts. Perhaps I went in on a lucky day, but I can't think of a time when I didn't walk out of there with at least something.I was sorry to read the previous review, because I have had such a consistently good time at this store. As for the store having a security guard, the one who works most of the time is a kick in the pants. He'll chat with you if given the opportunity. Also, every Ross has at least one, if not two, security guards working while the store is open. I hope more of you are encouraged to visit now that you know what a great time I have had there. It's one of the smaller Ross stores that I have been in, but it certainly packs a punch. Happy bargaining!~~#~1
The closest thing I have to a neighborhood pub.  Not bad.They sell loads of Belgian and Canadian beer.  That is all that you need to know.~~#~1
Saw CAKE there last year.  Nice grass, beautiful venue, great night!~~#~1
I really adore this place. They've got some of the best lentil soup around and all of their chicken dishes have been perfectly seasoned and very, very juicy. I recently got the kabob plate and it came out so tender and juicy it was falling apart on my fork. Their hummus and garlic sauce are both very good as well and the service is quick and friendly. Last time I was in, I noticed they expanded their dining section so the place is a bit bigger now, probably to accommodate the increase in customers from the park-and-ride light rail station right in front of their restaurant.Do yourself the favor. If you're heading on the light rail and feel hunger strike, stop off here and enjoy a nice meal. They have good lunch specials around $7.50 for a full plate with meat, hummus, garlic sauce, pita, and tabouli. Mmmm!~~#~1
I LOVE BURRITO EXPRESS. My fiance has been going with his friends since they were in high school and he finally took me to try the only thing his group ever orders: a steak, potato and cheese burrito. EPIC. This burrito was so awesome that they have never tried anything else on the menu and I feel the exact same way. The tortilla is huge and fresh and the burrito itself is gigantic. I can never finish mine but the boys seem to eat it right up! Don't leave this place without trying the horchata either, it's so good. I've been to other Mexican places like this and the horchata tasted like gross water. Burrito Express however does it right and I will always go back to this place whenever I'm up for the BEST BURRITO EVER.~~#~1
This is probably one of the more unique, trendy looking places in Phoenix-metro to lounge at.  Everything about AZ88 is eye-candy, literally., from the furniture to the drinks to the decor and of course, the patrons.  Drinks are made really, really tasty.  My usual choice of cocktail is the French 75.  My go-to appetizer is either the waffle fries that comes with three flavorful dipping sauces or the shrimp ceviche! The menu is pretty diverse with a little flair.What makes this place a hit for me are the contemporary, artsy decor making it a refreshing scene to come to compared to other Phoenix-ish ambiance.  Of course, you can't have all these modern, sophisticated attributes without a DJ playing fresh beats and sounds! Bottom line is the look and the vibe makes me feel like I am back in New York or Los Angeles.  I had given a 4-star prior, but I can honestly say AZ88 can hang with the big boys.~~#~1
Fantastic place to learn Krav Maga and workout. My two sons have been going to React Defense Systems, RDS, for years and they finally convinced me to go. I love it and it's too bad I didn't go earlier! The instructors and facility are top notch. As a beginner, the instructors made me feel welcome and motivated even though my skills were untrained. After two weeks, I can feel, see, and hear the difference. I love smacking the bag with sweaty fists and feet and seeing the sweat fly. If you are looking for intense conditioning, then RDS is the place. If you are looking for life saving skills, then RDS is still the place. Learn a great life skill, become fitter, and have fun. I agree with AZ Central: RDS is the best boxing/martial art facility in Arizona. In closing, I'd recommend RDS to anyone and I apologize to everyone for not being creative enough to think of something funny or flippant. Oh did I mention this is one of the few places in the world where parents and their kids can legally beat on each other and enjoy it?! When was the last time your son hit you? ;-)~~#~1
What a dream come true to traipse into this store with my toddler girl and my husband. The store is filled, ceiling to floor, with all varieties of toys for all age groups. Shelves upon shelves of brands and models you've likely never seen if your main toy-shopping stomping grounds are Toys R Us or Walmart. The store's management clearly has a relaxed attitude about children playing in the store -- toys are sprawled across the store,  ready for the next child's little hands. Yet, it didn't feel messy in there. The aisles are wide and smooth. The store is organized into various zones. (Dolls, science, blocks, books, baby, etc.)  This is an absolute oasis in suburbia land where you're always hard-pressed to find non-chain stores.~~#~1
My wife and I just got married at Blackstone, and I'm still amazed at how awesome they are to work with.  Elizabeth, Megan, and Alicia all worked tirelessly to make our wedding memorable.  The location couldn't have been better, I'm still getting compliments on how beautiful it was.  We read the glowing reviews prior to booking, and all I can say is that I agree with them 100%.~~#~1
Awesome pool.~~#~1
Don't bother with this place.  I had never been here, my husband and I decided to pick up some food to take home.  We ordered a shrimp tempura appetizer, an assorted tempura appetizer, a lobster appetizer, and yakisoba.  When we got home the order was totally wrong. Instead of lobster we were given mussels (which were gross), instead of assorted tempura and shrimp tempura we only got assorted tempura with 2... that's right only 2 shrimp in the whole mix.  The yakisoba was the only part of the order they got right and it was not that great, pretty bland.  I love Japanese food and I was really excited to find a place near by and while we were waiting for our order we were excitedly planning to come back and have their sushi, but after this complete mix up and poor quality food there is no way I would trust them with anything raw.  Never going back, such a complete disappointment.~~#~0
Ive eaten here twice and I dont think Ill ever eat here again. I ordered the lettuce wraps and the food smelled like horrible BO. It made me so nauseous I couldnt even eat it. The salad is decent but I still cant get over that smell!~~#~0
I think Mr Goodcents has the best subs in town.  I have no idea why people go to Subway.  Goodcents slices the meat and cheese when you order your sandwich and their bread is baked fresh - you can't beat it.  Get oil and vinegar on your sandwich and the taste is to die for.  The staff was very friendly and oftentimes the owners are there working.  $5 footlongs are there too - only they taste 20x's better!  They're all over the city if this one isn't in your neck of the woods.~~#~1
I discovered this place by going on one of my usual 20 mile bike rides along the canal until something cool popped up. I sat outside and sipped a nice chamomile tea as the first rain of winter fell unleashing an amazing scent. The staff was top notch and I was delighted to see several tannat wines from Uruguay on the menu. I can't wait to return some evening to share a bottle of wine and tapas with my girlfriend.~~#~1
Awesome staff. Great prices. Left feeling relaxed and refreshed. A must try.~~#~1
yuk! service and food sucked never again!~~#~0
I went today with three friends for dinner around 6 PM Sunday night. Though it seemed quite busy, I was pleased to get a seat within two minutes upon arrival. Outside seating, despite a hot Arizona summer, was pretty nice with shade. However, this is where the pleasanties end.Our table remain neglected for approximately twenty minutes. No one bothered to offer us drinks, and it was quite irritating to see tables who arrived after us being served appetizers. When our waiter came, he did not even apologize for the wait, and we gave our orders: drinks, appetizers, and pita sandwiches.The hummus and garlic dip came relatively quickly, only twenty minutes later. Both were alright, but something is seriously wrong if all of us were only served one pita with the two dips, and each dip was more than twice the size of the pita. We asked our waiter for extra pita, and he kindly agreed. The entire duration of dinner, it never came.Refills were also a pain, as we would ask someone to fetch our waiter, and he wouldn't come until ten minutes later.An hour after ordering could not possibly justify only four meager gyro sandwiches. I've been to plenty of other businesses who have made that kind of order and more in just ten minutes during a busy lunch hour. Half the tables outside already left, including tables that arrived after us, and we were the last ones served. The food was of average quality, and I've been to better with cheaper prices.Slightly expensive, I can see as justified. But many agree that time is worth much more than money. I had an excessive amount, over an hour and a half, wasted on a decellerating Sunday night. Staff is kind of nice, but I suggest a serious change in priorities so that first time customers like myself aren't immediately turned off. I can say for certain that I'm never coming here again, and I'll find myself at better places much closer to home.~~#~0
I just went here for the first time a week ago (visiting my parents who just moved to FH). A++Great location, view of the fountain, outside seating, nice decor inside, really wonderful owner and a big menu of pastries, croissant, sandwiches, Italian sodas, and coffee.I had the egg salad sandwich (the croissant and egg salad was SO FRESH!!) with a side of potato salad was probably one of the top 3 potato salads I've ever had!I also got an iced mocha which was just the way I like it, on the sweet side.I had my 14 month old daughter with me so I also shared the potato salad with her and ordered a yogurt with granola.  This was no ordinary McDonalds yogurt parfait - it was so delicious I had to have some too!One gripe (that could be easily fixed by the owner) - PLEASE BUY ONE HIGHCHAIR for your guests to use.  We would love to come back often (as we go see grandma/grandpa) but I can't take another lunch with her on my lap:)~~#~1
I hate to give this place 1 star but my recent experiences were horrible. I use to dine at this restaurant often with my family. The more we go, service decreased. Our water cups never get filled.The very last time I was there, I found a gnat in my pho. Although I have eaten about 50% of the medicore pho, they asked if I wanted another bowl. I said no; I was there on my lunch break. No time to wait for another bowl. I got up to pay for my bill and to my surprise, there was no discount or any sort of accommodation. I am disappointed with them and will not be back.~~#~0
We have been eating here for years. I am as picky of a new yorker as they get (with food). I will say we do not eat there Monday or Tuesday's, The cook must be different, its not as good on those days. The rest of the week is 5 stars all the way.Great sesame chicken,fried rice, lo mien etc. Highly suggest.~~#~1
There are a lot of places to visit on Mill Avenue . . . however, there is no place like Fat Tuesday!   When we visit Tempe, we always make it a point to stop at "Fats".   We have always visited before the night time crowd comes.  When we walk in the door, the bartenders remember us, suggest yummy drinks, ask about us . . . treat us like we are special.   We have struck up many conversations with other patrons who enjoy going to Fat Tuesdays as much as we do.  During the day it''s a great place to just get out of the heat, cool off with their daquiris and eat a delicious Po Boy.  Jason is our favorite bartender . . . and we have lots of laughs with him!   I am counting the days until weI will be back in AZ to go to Fat Tuesday!~~#~1
When I was a dancer I always came here for everything. Shoes, leotards, skirts, and accessories. They have every type of dance shoe and a wide variety of everything dancers need and want. I'm not sure how many dance shops are in the area, but all of my instructors always recommended this place which is not very close to our studio. The staff is all very kind and knowledgeable which trust me is a very good thing. Dance shoes can get confusing! There are at least three different kind of tap shoes! Dee's also has costume rentals so if you ever need a crazy costume at the last minute Dee's can help you out with that too!~~#~1
Thank you Yelp... I only wish i had six Stars... Ok officially for anyone reading this pretend there are Six Freaking Stars... This place is THAT good!I thank Yelp because the only way I found this place was searching for 'third wave coffee' (those who know what I mean by this will just know... everyone else will just have to experience and forever after never drink Starbucks again) while I was traveling in Tempe.  I don't 'like' coffee, I LOVE it (insert Antono Ego voice from Ratatouillie movie here)... I literally have a coffee shrine in my house where I run a vintage Rancilio Z11 and pride myself on my espresso skills.  Simply put, I will never pull a shot like i had here.  Off the chart awesome!  So that's the first 5 Stars...the Sixth star?? I just can't believe they have GOOD pastry too!  I understand they produce in-house and if that's true then it's completely astounding.  Easily the best croissant I've had outside of Paris.  Run, don't walk to the Coffee Lab; it is worth the flight to Tempe.~~#~1
If you own a car that is older and you want it to look and smell new - this is the place.  Our 3 year old truck looks brand spanking new after these guys got done with it.  We also had them tint it and it turned out amazing ... again ... I say again because this is the second vehicle I have taken to them.  That is the main reason I went back - I could not believe how good both my vehicles turned out.  I had the window tint on the other one for about 3 years before I sold it and still to the day I sold it ... the tint was perfect.  They use only the top quality film, and do quality work.  I will keep going back and sing their praises all day long!  If you are looking for a detail job, or window tint, this is the ONLY place you should be looking!  Check out some pictures I took of my vehicles after they got done..~~#~1
I'm a complete dive bar junkie. Whether I'm in a big city, or small town I always seek out the local spots. I was in Tempe with work and we happened to drive into town right at last call so we searched for the closest bar which just happened to be Monkey Pants. After we got over laughing at the name and the paint job on their truck...we went in and were greeted by the waitress right away. It wasn't too busy especially for a Friday night but the place is huge! The bartender was very attentive and adorable.  I really wish I could've made another stop at this bar before I went back home..I saw a bunch of posters for all these theme nights and great deals. Reading previous reviews it sounds like they have parties going on like this all the time. Great bar!~~#~1
The perfect burger. Awesome BBQ! NEVER a bad meal!~~#~1
Why'd the chicken cross the road?To get to Food Truck Fridays in Downtown Phoenix!I know that all you business Yelpers go out for lunch on Friday's, it's basically a rule if you sit in an office, a cubicle, or behind a desk somewhere from Monday through Friday; don't believe me, check the company hand book you were given on your first day of work. Somewhere between how to comb your hair, what you shouldn't wear, and please don't come in smelling like Nair, you'll find it. While Yelping about your Friday lunch is purely optional, I certainly hope you do ;-)During your weekly 1 hour exodus into the space beyond the cubicles and plaster walls, ending up in the open air of Food Truck Friday will kick off your weekend right. It's not just for Burger King people, it's time to get it your way! Pick your favorite food from, Gourmet Hot dogs with Short Leash, or Mexican with Luncha Libre, Smoothies and Salads with Mojo Bowl, to Pies with Mama Toledos, and Creme Brulee with Torched Goodness. Bring your friends and your favorite gal; they can choose their own favorite too. Don't worry about bringing cash, everyone here will swipe your plastic just as easy.This is your lunch hour, kick back and forget about work while you're here, if only for 45 minutes. Listen to the DJ's spinning popular music through their thumping sound system while you dine on your fine food. Chill out in the seating area which is cordoned off with misters, fans, and swamp coolers; bringing down the temp from a roasting 108 to a palatable upper 90's. This is your Downtown business Yelpers, it's time to kick off those business casuals, and make Friday lunch your own!~~#~1
This place rocks!!  We bought 750 sq ft of tile a few months ago to install on our own and we had no idea what we were doing.  They helped us every step of the way. We made several visits over the course of about 3 months and everyone we talked to was helpful and knowledgable. I will absolutely go back when we re-do the floors in the rest of the house.And the prices are the best.  I am a bargain shopper and will research prices for months before making a large purchase and that is exactly what I did when we embarked on this project.  I researched prices all over... online, in stores, with contractors, etc and Floor and Decor by far had the best prices.  The entire floor cost less than $1500 in tile, materials, and tools. It looks beautiful and I couldn't be happier!~~#~1
How have I NOT reviewed Four Peaks yet?!Awesome. Even when its wall to wall packed. Even after waiting in a 2 hour line for the special St. Paddy's day breakfast and festivities. The beers are great. the food is oh so good. you really cant go wrong w/ anything that includes their beer bread. And their breakfast! If you can brave the crowd that comes out for it, seriously do it. One of the best breakfasts in town. Ive had almost every item on their brunch menu, and I cant think of one that disappointed.GO.~~#~1
i moved to the tempe area about 2 weeks ago from socal, the mecca for asian restaurants.  since moving out here, my only taste for asian food has been panda express.  well, i was craving teriyaki last night but had no idea where to go so i did a search here.  tokyo house got a bunch of great reviews and everyone mentioned a cool old man behind the counter so i just had to check this place out.as soon as i walked in the door, i was greeted by the old man...from across the joint, behind the counter, mind you.  he was SUPER nice and SUPER funny!  checked out the menu and the selection was a bit overwhelming!  they have every teriyaki dish available, and bunch of fried rice and noodle choices, and for those that like rabbit food, vegetable dishes.  i was a bit surprised though to not see gyoza or pot stickers on the menu...was bummed out about that.i had a hard time deciding what to get but remembered Sarah W.'s review of the house chicken, so i went with that.  i went with a large order and let me tell you; if you're hungry, you definitely will be stuffed after a large order.  the dish was very tasty and delicious and was definitely overflowing with mushroom.  i love mushroom!  the house chicken is supposed to be spicy and although it had a little kick, it wasn't the "spicy" i was used to from asian joints in socal.  i wish it had a bit more rice, though.  either way, the dish was great!  i would definitely order it again!i highly recommend this joint.  you will be treated well by the cool old man behind the counter, the place is clean, the servings are generous and the  price is cheap!~~#~1
As many other people have said in other reviews, Betito's is similar to Filibertos.  However, I thought Betitos tasted a little better.  The food was less greasy than Filibertos.  My family had Carne asada burrito, carnitas burrito, a chicken chimichanga, and the super nachos.  They all tasted excellent.  My favorite was the carnitas burrito.  Now, Betitos offers one dollar tacos on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays.  I haven't tried their tacos yet, but I intend to try them in the future.~~#~1
I eat here often and the lunch special is great!!  Food and service are equally good.  Fries are to die for.~~#~1
great pho , boba :) and vermicelli .. awesome !~~#~1
Their Alfredo the Dark is probably the best pasta dish in Phx. And then there's the Pazookie...~~#~1
Hiking Camelback Mountain has to have been the most difficult 1 1/2 mile hike (Just up, 3 miles total) that I have ever been on. While it is not a very far distance the increase in elevation is over 1000 feet in that short mile and a half. The first thing that I recommend is either getting to Echo Park at bright and early (between 4:30-5:30 am) or, if you come later as I did just parking in the overflow parking. You can find a simple map to the overflow parking at: http://phoenix.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Camelback-Mountain-Trailhead-Overflow-Parking.pngThe walk to the Echo Canyon trail head to the overflow parking is only about 20-25 minutes and it is almost guaranteed to be faster than driving around looking for a parking spot somewhere else. The trail itself takes about 20 minutes to actually get difficult but when it does decide to start getting hard it does not let up for a moment. There are chain link fences at a couple of places in the hike to stop people from accidentally tumbling over very steep ledges and even handrails at times for more support up the trickiest sections of the hike. The good and bad of this hike is how crowded it is. There will rarely be a moment where you wont see someone coming or going for more that 50 yards at a time. This means that while there is little to no quiet and privacy, that if something were to happen to you there would be plenty of witnesses.The rest at the top is wonderful. The view is by far the best in the valley and something that I recommend to everyone. Take 20 minutes or so to eat a snack, drink some water, take a breather and take some breathtaking pictures from the summit. The summit is usually pretty crowded so you won't want to stay too long. Be careful on the way back. It can be very tricky navigating some of the areas and twisted ankles and even broken legs are not terribly uncommon. Again, take you time and take plenty of breaks when you need them and you should be OK.Don't forget to take plenty of water, I recommend at least a liter per person if you go in the morning and more that that if you do in when it is warmer outside.~~#~1
When my youngest son graduated I took him to Buzz Boys when they were in the Food City complex. He is now 25 and still goes. I gave a family friend a gift certificate for Fathers day. He still goes and so does his 30 yr old son. My oldest son is out of the Army and he started going. These men compare this to a spa for men. Hot towels, straight razor shave, etc. Hey I should get commission lol:)~~#~1
The worst Thai food I've ever had! This place was recommended to us by another couple, and wow was I disappointed!Everything was completely blase and tasteless, the only exception being the extreme spiciness of my fiance's entree(probably to make up for the lack of other spices)...don't bother with this place.~~#~0
Went there for a quick bite before the theater.   Had the buffalo sloppy joes, and they were disgusting--dry buns, thin sliced pickle.  Then had the duck spring rolls--also bad.   Then in an effort to eat something we could tolerate, ordered the lettuce cups with shrimp, and they were just adquate.   Very disappointing!~~#~0
I have been here many times and have always had good food and service.~~#~1
I heart Rome's Pizza!! Being a native New Yorker, I have struggled over the past two years to find anything remotely close to NY style pizza. I had tried many local, independent places, but no one got it right. When I moved back to Scottsdale about 6 months ago my guy and I passed this place driving down McDowell road. I figured we could try it out (I'm always on the look out for some yummy pizza). Don't be taken back by the empty parking lot and shabby exterior, after all, isn't it what's inside that counts?? The food is always fresh. The Greek salad is great - it comes in small and large. The pizza is amazing (as long as you know what you're getting - NY style). I know that it's family owned, which I always have an appreciation for. The man that owns it does most of the deliveries. When I first moved to the area I called for delivery and he had to call me because he couldn't find my street. Embarrassingly, I only knew the street I lived on and not much more, so I couldn't help him. He told me that it was okay and eventually found the house. I expected him to get out of the car and give me a huge attitude, thinking I'm an idiot because I didn't know where I lived (could you really blame him?). But he was as sweet as could be and told me it was no problem. How refreshing! In a nutshell, hoooorray for Rome's!!~~#~1
Joe's Farm Grill features everything that is All-American. Burgers, pizzas, salads, hot dogs, and a variety of other classics, each with their own twist. I was pleasantly surprised that Sonoran Dogs were on the menu (I rarely see them outside of Tucson). I got a burger that was gigantic and yummy--don't forget to ask for grilled onions. There are a number of novelties in each of Joe's restaurants, but my favorite part about this one is that it is nestled right next to farmland. The ingredients here touted to be fresh and local, and I could definitely taste the difference in my burger and especially in the fruit cup.I took my brother here for his birthday; he got a 4B and looved it. He wasn't able to complete the trifecta but there will always be next year!~~#~1
After sitting at our table for 30 minutes and not getting any service, we left.  But not before the hostess said thanks for coming in. Needles to say I will not be returning.~~#~0
Jake's been taking care of our cars for almost 7 years. He's very trustworthy and fair.~~#~1
My new favorite place.  I love this pizza.  I became a vegetarian in March.  So cheese pizza with mushrooms and olives is very important to me.  And Mamma Mia's is cheap and delicious, my favorite combo.  And my constant companion, my 9 year old daughter born in Philly and a fan of hoagies, loves their turkey subs.  I'm just in it for the pizza.  And if you sit outside you can watch the people going to the liquor store next door and watch the people playing frogger to get across the street to the Vig.  Pretty good people watching.~~#~1
I will never make another purchase from this company ever again! The company tried to deliver damaged furniture to my home and then gave me the run around about processing a refund when I refused to accept the items. After 5 phone conversations, they agreed to refund me for refusing damaged items. I cannot recommend this to anyone.~~#~0
So.......I love Defalco's. My bf and I are addicted to the Il Purista, which is JUST PERFECTION, with and without the prosciutto. I've had someone describe their service to me as "New York style" and I agree with that assessment, so if you cant hang with it, then go be a baby somewhere else. The food is fresh, delicious, and incredible. Their lattes are bomb, and the cannolis pretty great too. I dont have a single bad thing to say about these folks or their amazing food.~~#~1
Just your typical warehouse club right?  I guess that depends on your definition of typical.  Sam's club has hours just for buisness members starting at 7:00am.  You can also fax in or go online and have them shop for you.  All you do is go in a pay for it.They have a few membership levels- Business, Gold Member and Premium.  The Premium level you earn 2% back on all your purchases.  They do give you two cards for the price that you pay, so you can go in with a neighbor and each get a card.In addition to electronics, photo lab, optical center, bakery, meat department, they also have a little know "clearance" section at each Sam's.  You just have to know where it is.  Also when they are clearancing out merchandise, the price will end in a "1".  Most common is .71 or .81.  I have picked up 5 pound bags of mixed candy for .71 a bag, and lots of other deals just by knowing this little secret.They do discount their meat the day before they need to pull it from the shelves.  They also will give cookies to children.My boys also love the cafe where they get their "pizza and drink please."  Their menu has changed  a lot lately though and I am not sure if I like it.  Prices are very reasonable though.They also have gasoline pumps outside which if you know your prices can be a good thing!If you are not satified with your membership, you can cancel at anytime and they will prorate your membership refund.  Their refund policy is really good as well.~~#~1
I've done the Shabu Fondue more times than I can count!  Usually, I order a cheese fondu for myself, and my main man gets a Shabu dish.  They both apply the same concepts... dip something fresh into something very hot and cook it yourself with long sticks.  Mm!  I've tried all the cheese fondues, and the Swiss is my favorite.  That smell is unforgettable.  I've tried all the Shabu sauces too, and they're all pretty strong, so they season those boring vegetables right up.  The cocktail menu should not be over-looked.  The caramel apple martini is the best!!!  Now the chocolate fondue....  Oh it's so good!  They serve it with marshmallows, fruit and even a slice of cheesecake to dip in!  For a very small price, you can also add a shot of liquor.  (I personally always add a shot of Bailey's to add some flavor.)  This is a PERFECT date restaurant, and it's not bad for groups either.  The dcor is pretty rad too.  The portions are healthy, but it only works if you end the dinner with the chocolate...~~#~1
Tempe Beach Park - such a gem in our landlocked State...Sure, it's a man-made water source, and yes - it's pretty nasty if you plan on swimming inside Tempe Town Lake, but it's gorgeous during the day and at night too!I've done a handful of triathlons that started and ended at Tempe Beach Park, and most recently, I did the PetSmart Walk (go team Yelp) that took place at the park as well... With the proximity of the park to ASU / Mill Ave, it really is a fun place to go hang for an afternoon - no matter what's going on there...My only words of wisdom - don't swallow the lake water!~~#~1
This place is so unbelievably cool. In a city desperate for arts, this is perfect! "Her Secret is Patience" is a bold statement for downtown, a sign of youth, renaissance, and complexity. It's serenity and over-looming stature make it something to admire. I wish more public spaces in the Valley were this awesome. It's worth checking out, even if it's not your taste in art, you've got to admit it's pretty interesting. Be sure to see at at night too! Lot's of beautiful colors accent the homogenized office buildings. :)~~#~1
I resisted eating Zoyo for months after they opened because I was afraid I'd get hooked and be there every day. And, yep, it's addictive. They always have new flavors to try, but right now my fave is salted caramel. It's incredible. I usually pass on toppings.As other have suggested, it'd be nice if they had smaller containers. But I am impressed that they can keep the store so clean with the giant roll-up doors open. They lead to a nice patio that's sufficiently removed from the street that you're not just breathing exhaust.~~#~1
Finally a raw food cafe that isn't in Tempe.  Love their drinks and raw food menu.  Just wish their prices would come down bit.    This is the type of place I could eat at everyday.  I know it is good because the afternoon lull doesn't happen to me when I eat here.    I do NOT go daily, due to pricing, but I would like too, because I would simply live longer eating here.  Your body buzzes with clean energy (non-caffeine) after eating here.  If you are a person who wants to be nice to your body.  Splurge and give your body what it craves....Enzymes.    Who knew raw food was the answer to avoiding afternoon coffee.......?~~#~1
Love this place, food is very well portioned, and yummy.  I really love the endless selection of bottled drinks offered.  Must try if your craving a soda different from the normal selections offered.  But, they do have the standby soda selections available as well.  Stop in, burgers have some crazy combinations to try.~~#~1
...The best Pad Thai I've ever tasted!!!  Crab Wontons melt in your mouth!!! Excellent service... GO !!!~~#~1
Was I there on a bad day or what?  I showed up 15 minutes after they opened and EVERY item I tried was either luke warm or cold.    They have 15+ items on the lunch buffet and I tried a bite of all of them.   Gross and bland.   I felt sick to my stomach after I left because I kept thinking how bad the food was. Yuck!~~#~0
being that i'm fully vietnamese and my mom has made all types vietnamese dishes ever since i was a kid, i have quite the tastebuds for authentic vietnamese food. also, growing up in so cal there are a lot more restaurants to choose from. for arizona, this place is probably one of the best authentic vietnamese restaurants in town. i always get their pho ap chao....even the owner knows this when i step foot in the door. :) their pho is really great..the broth is good, the beef is good, the noodles are good. everything is like it should be. their spring rolls are pretty decent. what i really like is it doesn't pretend to be something it's not. it's a hole in the wall place, but most good and REAL vietnamese places are. the food is great and the service is quick.~~#~1
Barrio Cafe is an amazing Mexican restaurant.  Chef Silvana Salcido Esparza travels to Mexico for many of her ingredients and you can tell - things are always fresh (they only have an ice cream freezer!), creative and authentic.  I am more than content w/ a mango margarita, the incredible guacamole and the gooey caramel filled churros!!  Even when the restaurant is packed, the staff is friendly and informative.~~#~1
I can't say enough good things about this place.  I literally have never had a plate here I didn't like, they also have a interesting and ever changing list of specials (I usually order off the specials menu).  This is definitely one of those places I could eat at every day.  All that and I don't even drink beer, my friends really like the beer here though.~~#~1
After four years of living in AZ I finally found Mexican food that appeals to me and my husband. Lets just say they changed my husbands view on tacos. He never swayed from eating vegetarian burritos until he got a hold of their carne asada tacos. In the last 4 months we lived in AZ we went there almost every week and brought friends, whom now can't get enough of them too.They are reasonably priced, have great customer service and everything we have eaten so far has been fabulous. If you are looking for great food and you're not concerned with being in a fine dining Mexican restaurant, then look no further. We miss you Los Taquitos.....~~#~1
The Rusty Spur has the distinction of being the oldest cowboy bar in Arizona and a gen-u-ine registered historic landmark. It's even got a hitchin' post for yer horses out front. The Spur has been patronized by the likes of John Wayne and Clint Eastwood -- although never while I've been there. There's great live music four afternoons and six nights a week. Other good things include plenty of parking, no cover, and a fun venue to people-watch.~~#~1
veerrrrrryyyyyyyyy dirty. I think I will buy them some clorox wipes and light bulbs for their sign out front. I made 12 u-turns trying to find this place.~~#~0
Tommy V's is a delightful twist on old town dining where fine wines come with a surprisingly  refreshing price and food pairings  are always fresh and so delicious.  The atmosphere matches the name - just oh, so chic! and the staff is always very gracious!  We will return many times this summer with the new special app & entree deal too! When I set out to go to happy hour last week, I didn't expect Prince Edward Island Mussels and a most fantastic wine that our waiter recommended!Tommy V's has the recipe for success in good cuisine, wine, and ambiance!~~#~1
We love Niro's! The hot dogs and Italian beef sandwiches are dynamite! The Greek salad is big and fresh. The gyros are also excellent. I'm a French fry junkie and these are my favorite in Phoenix! Service is fast and prices are good. The owners are almost always there and make us feel so welcome!~~#~1
Jimmy Johns is cheaper and better ... The Capriotti food is heavy ... and it doesn't taste as good as you think it should taste~~#~0
On my little trip around the city I drove over to Sweet Pea. Very cute store and great personable staff.Nice selection to baked goods and great taste.What nice find in the downtown area. I've got Wicked Bakery up north and Sweet Pea downtown... North and South is covered for those sudden cravings... now time to find something on the on West and East sides of the city.~~#~1
Great food as always.  The owner is incredibly professional, friendly and charismatic;came buy three times to check in on experience and even asked if we wanted more antipasto salad items(on an already generous, well-priced portion.)  The service is great.  Homemade breads.  Extremely generous portions.  I would highly recommend this restaurant to all.~~#~1
Service is good... The newer waitors tend to forget you're there. Food is delicious, never gotten food poisoning... Cheesecake is magnificent... The best kind is the Godiva, expensive bit worth it!~~#~1
This is a great boutique in North Scottsdale.  Ruby has such cute dresses to go out in and is a little jewel box inside of this shopping center.  As the two other reviews said they carry great brands like the established Tibi or even new brands.  One  that I saw and loved from Phoenix Fashion Week was Smoke & Mirrors Clothing from Los Angeles.  Ruby carries a lot of what I saw and loved on the runway.  Ruby is always getting new stuff in so it's a great place to check in with anytime you need a dress or a kick start to your newest fashion routine. Two thumbs up!~~#~1
I'm ashamed that I haven't left a review for this place yet. I've eaten here for a good while and I've never been disappointed with the food. Well, there was this one time, but it was because it was sold out. I'm okay with that, it tells me it was really popular that night. Anyway...The prices are good, the teas are good, and it's just fun to sit in the pews while watching the candles melt. Every friend I've brought here has had a good time with an equally good meal. I'm a sucker for the royale with cheese and a side of thousand island.You know what, look at the average review score. I really think that's the most telling part of this place. Really. Go. Eat. Enjoy.~~#~1
Delightful experience! I came in with my 2 little ones alone. Jay was our waiter, and a very good one. He got the chefs to prepare their sunsine roll with orange and passionfruit dressing, because I am highly allergic to mango. He was very accomodating. I also had the seared tuna tataki, which was also excellent. My kids had miso soup and their fried rice; both were very good. I was very surprised that a strip mall sushi joint would be thay delicious. Thumbs up!!~~#~1
This feels like a neighborhood bistro (much like the ones I have visited in New York).  The food is wonderful and the wine selection varies which I like.  My favorite dishes include:  Salmon, crab crepe, burger and ahi tartar -- but their menu changes often, so don't be surprised if you eat something you like and it's not there next time.~~#~1
What can I say...Maharaja Palace was my midday getaway while living out in Phoenix, and I miss it dearly.  I visit as often as I can (up to three times a year, traveling from Hawaii) and when I do, I am always astounded by the flavors and array of choices this buffet provides.  The tiki marsala happens to be my favorite dish and I find the staff to be accomodating and attentive, especially when ensuring I've got enough na'an to sop up my plate's delightful curries.  I can't wait to return.  This is THE SPOT for Indian Food in the PHX Metro Area, hands down!~~#~1
The family and I love this place, as does anyone I've taken there. First time I went I had a cheeseburger pizza - huge and delicious. Their beer is great too - brewed right on the spot. My wife loved the fish tacos -- it says a lot about a place that every time you go, everything you try, is fantastic. You'll pay a little bit, but it's worth it.~~#~1

Since I moved to AZ from Los Angeles I have been searching far and wide for a sushi place that met my high standards for great sushi. Sakana is hands down the best in town. The fish is fresh, the rolls are huge and nothing beats the .50 cent appetizers when you buy a beer! I recommend going on a weeknight, Friday and Saturday nights can fill up pretty quickly so you might have to wait.... but it's worth it.~~#~1
Wow. Wow Freakin' Wow.I have never, ever had such a perfect dining experience from the minute they greet you, learn your name, cater to your every need, and give you FABULOUS, beautifully prepared food since...well, NEVER. I must say I did do my research, so I did know what I wanted to try and even though I kind of expected the JW Marriott to be more of a snooty place, I felt it would be closest to my house and wanted to find out for myself what all the hoopla was about this Roy person and his fish.I went with my friend Amy who was visiting from New York. She had been to Roy's before and is a fellow foodie. We got to the restaurant early and went outside on the immense patio area to sit and have a drink. It's December so a bit chilly but the HUGE, soft patio furniture was extremely cozy and we sat and had $20 martinis (LOADED with vodka. Warning: We had to ask for more fruit juice! And we are major drinkers - just gotta throw that in there.) Our waitress on the patio could not have been more accomodating and she even brought us new martinis even though we drank quite a bit of our strong ones. I am a people watcher and it was nice to see that there was an assortment of people sitting on the furniture, some of them looked like they could be relatives of mine, enjoying the late afternoon, reading, conversing....well, if I HAD any rich or classy relatives, that is. It was very nice and relaxing. Plus the Mariott property is stunning and I wish I could have looked around the property more than we did.When we meandered inside for dinner, the hostess greeted us by name and our server showed us to our table. She was very competent, could make recommendations, and was pleasant without being clingy. We loved her. She reminded me of Joan Cusack. Sounded just like her!The complimentary appetizer of lightly spiced, steamed edamame was delightful and even though they gave us warmed wet washcloths we were complete heathens and ate with our hands without ever using them.We shared the Roy's Canoe for Two, which had Lobster potstickers, Beef Satay, shrimp on a stick (not its real name), and Tuna Sushi Rolls. I must say - the Lobster potstickers - better than sex. The Beef satay was basically this ultra-tender beef on a stick, lightly flavored and grilled. Fabulous. But the pinnacle of perfection here was the Tuna sushi rolls, which absolutely knocked our socks off. I have never, ever had such an amazing piece of sushi before that moment. I think our  server, Joan Cusack (Not her real name) thought I was choking because as I ate it, my eyes were rolling back into my head in ecstacy.  She bustled over and once she got closer she could see she was merely interrupting a very intimate moment with me and my tuna roll and she went back to her post after giving me a thumbs-up sign. For whatever reason, these tuna sushi rolls were encrusted in what may have been macadamia nuts and it was completely divine. I re-live that moment over and over. MMM.But you know, the showstopper was STILL yet to come. I could not believe my luck when my Roy's Trio was placed in front of me. It was a piece of Hawaiian butterfish in Miso sauce, a piece of Seared Ahi, and a piece of salmon. The poor salmon! It was the best salmon I ever had out, but next to those two it was like Cinderella's ugly stepsister. Just upstaged by the butterfish, which is melt-in-your mouth decadence, and the seared ahi - which surpassed the tuna roll I just got done fantasizing about as the most perfect piece of sushi EVER.Amy got the butterfish. We licked our plates clean. Amy tried my Ahi and declared it, like I did, the BEST seared Ahi on the planet.For dessert, you KNOW I had to have the molten chocolate souffle. How good was it?? Brad Pitt could have walked up naked to our table and I would not have looked up long enough to stop shoveling it into my face.Amy ordered the 3 creme brulees - one had a Hawaiian orchid on it, and they were not only lovely but they tasted amazing. The coconut one was so fresh and it made me think that THIS is what every coconut cream pie in the world needs to taste like. I think the other flavors are vanilla bean (very good too) and maybe rum? (also very good) It may not sound like I am doing the dessert justice but when you've been kissing George Clooney for an hour then along comes Rick Springfield, which one is better? They are both amazing, but by the time Rick comes along, well, you're kind of spoiled already.Roy's could not have been better - this entire experience was an A++ through and through. The staff was extremely helpful (someone walked me to the ladies room when I merely asked where it was) (Oh and need I mention the corwn molding in the bathroom stalls was nicer than the crown molding in my house???) (And you know you are in a classy joint when a basket of tampons and maxi-pads is out on the marble bathroom counter, like party favors for down under)THUMBS WAY UP!!!~~#~1
I recently decided to accompany a couple friends on their quest to find the best sushi in Phoenix. A few weeks ago we started here at Yasu Sushi Bistro. While I'm not as committed to the quest as they are, I would be surprised if Yasu didn't rank among the top five sushi places in the Valley.We had an incredible dining experience at Yasu. Our server was perfect: she definitely knew sushi and had many great recommendations. I'm still somewhat of a sushi novice, but you don't have to be a pro to know when you're eating a fresh, creative meal.My recommendations: start off with miso soup with clams and try the hamachi carpaccio. At the end of the meal ask your server to have the chef make you something special. He made us tempura avocado wrapped in eel, topped with foie gras and served it to us personally. It was amazing.Yasu provided one of the best dining experiences I've had all year.~~#~1
I just thought I'd post an update.  I planned never to go back, but was with a friend who really wanted one of their breakfast items.  I skipped ordering ANY food whatsoever and merely ordered coffee and watched her eat.  As fate would have it, she had a BACK HAIR in her scrambled eggs (we are 2 for 2 now).  My gag reflex is going off as I type this.  My husband, friends, and I have renamed this place the Black Hair Diner, and we've decided they have actual black bears cooking in the kitchen, since they can't seem to keep black hairs out of their food.~~#~0
My wife and I have a timeshare nearby and when we were doing a morning walk we saw this place and we asked our concierge she raved. We went and fell in love with the place. The service, the food, the friendship. We go back every time we are in town and the staff remembers you. Also my wife loves gnocchi and says that these are as good as her grandmother's.                                   Dave A~~#~1
We had a bad experience in May with a person at Charleston's we thought to be a manager (see review).  The next day my husband and brother-in-law contacted the restaurant manager, Chris, we had great and immediate communication with him and he encouraged us to give the restaurant another try as we had been happy there before.  Recently, we had a large party of family members dine at the restaurant and the service and food was perfect.  Chris made a point to check in with us at the table and at the end of the meal.  Great job, Chris and team!  We look forward to dining at Charleston's with you again soon.~~#~1
I am a huge fan of Chipotle but I will never come back to this location. The staff looks miserable and are SLOW. The cashier decided she would rather clean tables then ring people up so we waited for her to come back. Most of the tables were already clean so she could of waited to clean. The rice was crunchy like it wasn't cooked all the way and the steak was really chewy. Never again!~~#~0

I ordered my custom made door and it arrived recently for installation. The design was exactly to specifications, quality of construction and the finish are flawless. It took several months to get but it was worth it. This one improvement has increased the value of my home and makes my entire family feel safer.~~#~1
This is our DEFAULT happy hour.I won't be reviewing their dinner as I have never had an actual meal there.I'm not really a beer drinker, but they have such a big selection, I always find something i like. And I've been told they have a martini specials, but you don't go to a beer place and get martinis... come on.Pretty much their entire appetizer selection (which is what, 20 items?) is on the half price happy hour menu. You know what that means? Four sliders and fries for FOUR dollars. (Also recommended... Hawaiian Poke Stack).In summary, I can wrap up Yard House in two words.Heck. Yes.~~#~1
Divine,  the Carne Asada was so tasty,  flavorful and tender.  Everything we enjoyed tasted fresh and authentic. The guacamole was knock you socks off, traditional and limey, (I took my extra home and enjoyed the next day).  I liked what the previous reviewer who said also that the beans and rice are not an afterthought here, they are also amazingly well executed.  I am eager to get back an try the Chicken and Barbacoa as well as the roasted green chile cheese dip.   If your in the area of 44th Street and Thomas, forgo the big chain of Chipotle and show this lovey Phoenix gem some love, your taste buds will not be disappointed.~~#~1
Worst, slow service ever....especially with almost no one in the place. Food was average at best and thats being kind. Skip it if you are looking to eat or get a drink.Just an update: I (as well as a friend who wrote a review of the day) were contacted (I didn't see my message until today oops) and offered refunds and gift certificates. Now this seems all well and fine-I do appreciate them trying to make the most of the situation-but my friend is still waiting for a refund and/or certificate. So we shall see. If I could take away my star for more non-service then I would.~~#~0
I had not eaten in about 12 hours since we were at the hospital having a baby... and this pizza STILL tasted horrible.Barely average fast food quality and taste. Avoid!~~#~0
I took my kitty to the Beat the Heat low cost spay event and she came home with a hematoma in her ear that was NOT there when I took her there in the morning. Surprise, surprise...they can recommend a vet to take her to. I'm pretty mad about this.~~#~0
I am new to Jamba, however i am surprised at the AMAZING customer service that this store dishes out. One of the workers there has always noticed me as a regular customer. He has a stellar personality, gave me a 20% off card and sometimes has my order ready by the time i finish paying the cashier. He's always very bright and smiling or laughing with his co-workers, I believe his name is Christian. He suggested a banana oatmeal with peanut butter the other morning and i have to say that it has been the most incredible oatmeal i have ever had!!! (You must try this) At times i visit the store twice a day simply because i cannot get enough Jamba Juice!!~~#~1
I stopped by here last night after the Suns game. It was cheap and fast. Also, it was by far the best carne asada I have ever tasted. It was tender and juicy, and not at all rubbery. I know the last time I had carne asada it was rubbery, but that was also from a 'bertos joint. I enjoyed the way this place is set up. Walk up to the counter, order and they bring you your food. It is quick and efficient. We got the dinner for 2, 2 tacos, 2 burritos, chips and drinks for $20. The tacos were great, as were the burros. I will definitely be back. Oh the 5 stars are specifically for the quick, efficient service... and the BEST carne asada around.~~#~1
Great sports bar!  Shows most UFC, Boxing and WWE pay per views.  Friendly staff, good food....  draft beer selection could be a little better, but other than that, one of my favorite local pubs.~~#~1

Do you hate shaving as much as I do? Do you find waxing too painful and expensive every 6-8 weeks?  Well I have the answer for you!!!  Go see Cindy Semerdjian at Cosmetic Laser Solutions.  I was introduced to Cindy through a friend AND NOW I AM HOOKED!!!   Not only do I no longer have hair, it is very inexpensive!  How much did it cost for you to get waxed...what would you say if I told you for a few dollars more the hair would be gone...PERMANENTLY!   Cindy offers a free initial consultation.  A few prices that I have experienced on a per session basis is: underarm - $100 ; bikini (brazilian) - $100; full leg (both) - $250.I highly, highly recommend going to see Cindy!  Tell her Jillian sent you!    So get started today to get ready for summer!~~#~1
This place is awesome they r going to replace a bad  tire for me for free that another discount tire put on they r awesome~~#~1

If you are looking for a good vet, you have to read this.If you are looking for a vet that is COMPETENT, a vet that REALLY CARES about animals and a vet that is INEXPENSIVE and reasonably priced, then you really have to check out Dr. Howard at Grayhawk Animal Hospital in North Scottsdale. He is worth the trip.I am so impressed by Dr. Howard and his EXCEPTIONAL STAFF. Every time we come here we leave satisfied beyond our expectations. Since my last review, we have used them two more times. Once when Spencer got neutered, and once when he had to have his nails trimmed. I have to say I am so very impressed. I was holding back on reviewing them again until I could be certain that it would be an accurate review and to be certain that they are consistent with their outstanding service and pricing. Well, I can say confidently now that they most certainly are.Spencer was neutered here some time ago with no complications and no outrageous fees. When he was done his procedure, I received a happy, completely alert dog back from them. His incision was minimal, the sutures were tight and he healed quickly. It was done so well that he did not even lick at the area. It was like nothing ever happened.More recently, Spencer needed his nails trimmed, and because he was a rescued dog from a very abusive situation, he does not trust people and has a phobia to anyone touching his tail or feet. It is so bad that when I try to nicely, calmly approach him to trim his nails, he urinates all over himself and hides for the rest of the day. Spencer was really abused and as a result, grooming is really difficult.Well, I discussed this with the doctor's office and we decided that sedation (unfortunately) was our only option. His nails were getting too long and painful and something needed to be done. Well, we just got him back from the office and they were so good about it that they did not even have to sedate him. I am impressed, but what I am more impressed with is that they first tried to trim his nails without using sedation and had his best interest in mind. They really care about the animals they treat. They could have sedated him. It would have been quicker and easier and more profitable for them, but they didn't. They really did not want to use a drug on him if they did not have to - and so they didn't. They trimmed his nails up well and did not even cut into the quick or make him bleed. He left there, again and as usual, a happy, well taken care of dog. And we left there ecstatic! The bill was so inexpensive and Spencer was taken care of so well - like he was their dog. I just can't say enough good things about this Veterinary Office. I think that everyone knows that good medical professionals are hard to find - for humans and/or animals. So often, they just don't care about the patient. Well, not here. It appears to be their top priority. Dr. Howard is a very happy, well educated man and it shows in his practice in every way - right down to all of the people he hires (they are all equally happy and competent!). You will not be disappointed if you go here. They are honest and kind and not out to rip you off or get as much money from you as they can. They are truly exceptional. So if you need honest, competent & friendly care at very affordable prices, you owe it to yourself and your pet to make the trip over to see Dr. Howard at Grayhawk animal hospital. You will be in good hands! You will save money, and you won't be disappointed in the least.They are truly exceptional, but that is the end result of really caring, really liking your profession and really knowing what you are doing... And we love them for it!~~#~1
Best in town!!~~#~1
I had such a nice experience here - Classic Chicken - the first time that I really wanted to go back. Second time, onion strings were so greasy I couldn't eat them, burger was okay. Third time, yesterday? Enough to say we wont go back. Ever. Lovely and I sat in a sticky booth, he ordered 1/3 lb classic, me the bbq grilled chicken - both with a small soda. Soda was disgusting, flat, watery, gross. Upon the lovely's complaint, the bus boy brought him bottled water. I took one bite of my sandwich and was assaulted by hair. Gak. We got up and left our food. Jeff told the manager about the food and the soda, we got our money back with an apology saying they were sorry we 'didn't have a better experience'. Um. A better experience??? Seriously? 15 dollars? Ugh.~~#~0
Heather is awesome. She did my initial set of lashes and I've already gone back for a fill. Her prices are great and she does beautiful work! The compliments are rolling in. Absolutely recommend!~~#~1
I love love Barrio Cafe. The food is amazing and it is very cute and artsy.~~#~1
Chino Bandido is a staple for my sister and I. I'm not going to lie, when describing this place I feel the need to mention that while it's not much to look at on the outside--inside it delivers some of my favorite guilty pleasures.I encourage anyone who is trying this place for the first time to take a few minutes and allow the staff to guide you thru what they have to offer. With their complimentary taste test , you can try a few of their most popular dishes and learn how to order off of their moderately challenging menu (but once you get it, its super easy). I ALWAYS go for the combination of double jade red chicken, refried beans, and plain fried rice.The snickerdoodle at the end is perfectly baked. Every time. Love this place.~~#~1
I'm a pho snob, my hitlist is impressive. In Olympia, I ate pho literally every single day. Test me, wannabe purists...Nam Sao is the best. The guy always working and seeming to make the food is so quick and super sweet. Great service, my drink never goes empty, and the table is set in traditional pho-joint style: a metal caddy with spoons, forks [...], chopsticks, napkins, and all the delicious condiments.The menu is enormous, so if you happen to be in the mood for something other than their glorious, never-watered-down noodle soup, you can try something else. The spring rolls, I love them. The boba tea is great too, I've had it thicker and more rich at Pho Hoa in Oly but I like the less creamy variety served at Nam Sao. Fast service, cheap filling meal, wonderful server.. I literally cannot think of anything bad to say about Nam Sao, except it's so small it's kind of hard to find if you're new to the spot. Just go to the right of Fry's and you'll see this little piece of heaven with its lights on, welcoming you in.~~#~1
Great quality, great prices. If only they had longer hours, delivery of large items, and a gift registry, it'd be heaven.~~#~1
I usually do not write reviews, but was so horrified by my experience I had to. Went for a late night bite and drink with a friend, they were fairly busy so we had a seat at the bar. As I frequent The Moon often, I was happy to see the bar was busy as well. The bartender quickly came over and was noticably intoxicated, as she could not even tell me the flavors of vodka they had. We ordered our drinks, and watched as she broke glass into the ice, knocked over glassware and broke a beer bottle. As we looked around most of the guests had the same look of horror on their face. We decided to order some food, as she spilled my drink on us (refilled it with something completely different) and she could barely even talk at this point. We saw management watch her behavior and do nothing, as she preceded to grab dirty glassware and refill it with beer. I was so appauled by this we left befpre finishing our drinks or food. I'm not sure what she was on but if its visible to paying customers it should be visible to management. Being beyond embarassed for the establishment, I would doubt I will come back, sad as we would frequent the Moon 2-3 times a week. Horrible.~~#~0
Most livable city my eye!Plastic yuppies around every corner looking for a reason to belong.  I can't wait for the homosexuals to take control of this dog park and give it some class.Avoid at all cost.~~#~0
This place is awful.  I bring my fourteen year old daughter along for services once in awhile, and on two occasions here they managed to seat me and skip her for other clients that did not have appointments.  They wont accept a tip from your debit/credit card which is pretty inconvenient if you don't carry cash.  They use a cheap base coat in an unmarked bottle that leaves my polish job looking funky. My mother was a loyal client until she got an infection in her toe after a visit.  I don't like to write bad reviews but this place does not deserve your business.~~#~0
Cholla Trail is a lot of fun and moderate hike. Echo Canyone is a lot of fun but also more challenging. Overall both trails are so much fun and a great workout.~~#~1
All I can say is "yum!"~~#~1
I'm a little shocked how high this place is rated, to be honest.  I'm not disappointed easily, but I've given this place three chances to impress and they've consistently disappointed.   I live nearby and was very excited for a new, trendy place to eat & drink. The first time we went there, we sat at the "outside" bar. The male bartender was not personable at all-he was actually quite rude. When I politely asked him if he knew the price of a liquor off the top of his head (and not to worry about it if he didn't, I was just curious), he snottily replied with, "well, there's not a button for it so I don't know." He then rolled his eyes and walked away. I was astounded at how rude he was but shrugged it off. I actually felt bad because I thought somehow I offended or embarrassed him because he didn't know the price of this particular liquor, so I apologized to him, and he proceeded to made another smart comment about how he charged me the well price but that the next time I come in it might be much higher, again being very snotty and rude. My boyfriend was actually pretty upset at the way he spoke to me but chose to let it go because we just aren't the type if people to be confrontational or to complain.  After our meal and about an hour before close, he told us he was leaving and that another girl would be taking care of us. When she showed up all she did was clean the bar in preparation to close (even though that wasn't for another hour) and didn't even introduce herself or say hello. I waited for her to notice that my boyfriend's Blue Moon was empty but she was too busy cleaning so I asked her myself. She asked me what beer he was drinking, I told her, then watched her pour the wrong beer and give it to me as if I wouldn't notice. (Not all alcohol is available at that side of the bar. For instance Blue Moon and the liquor I was drinking are stored at the main bar, another point of annoyance for the original, rude male bartender. But how is that my fault? I didn't know that.  And clearly this girl didn't feel like going to the other bar to pour the correct beer for my boyfriend, even though she specifically asked me which beer he was drinking and then lazily poured whatever wheat beer they had in tap at the bar we were sitting at.) That was the "straw that broke the camel's back" for me. We paid out and went to Darcy McGees (in the same shopping center) where the staff are always pleasant and helpful.We have since given the Lion two more tries but been severely disappointed with the service. The food is excellent- but just cannot make up for the terrible service. The second time we tried this place we sat at the main bar (as to not inconvenience the bartender at the outside bar), and all of the bartenders were too busy talking amongst themselves to notice that both of us were empty on drinks and hungry with no menus offered to us. I'm sorry to say that we won't be giving this place another shot.~~#~0
The worse food and service. I have never given a bad review. I ordered a shrimp dish with brown rice. The waiter brought out white rice. The sauce was horrible and bland. The calamari salad was not fresh. The dressing was bland too. The waitress checked on us and we asked for check immediately.  She never asked if anything was wrong or if the food was good. I would never recommend or eat here again. The service and food was horrible. I was visiting from out of town and was hoping to get a new experience.  This was not it...~~#~0
Excellent pizza, great service, family environment in a beautiful setting.  That sounds like a tagline on a website, but it's legit.  The diavola and the salsiccia are my faves.  Just amazingly tasty, simple, pizza with quality ingredients made the right way in a brick oven.  Pizzeria Bianco might have em by an inch just based on pizza alone, but if you don't want to wait 2.5 hours for a pie, Cibo is the place to be, and almost as good.  And although Bianco has a 2.5 hour wait whereupon i generally drink wine for the duration(which might be part of the reason the pie is so good), the limoncello at Cibo generally floors me just as well in a quarter of the time..~~#~1
The quintessential Brewery with a wholly fantastic kitchen. Best spinach artichoke dip in the valley, period. From fried to gourmet Four Peaks has it all. Beerbread sandwiches are always excellent, fish and chips, bavarian pretzels, french fries, daily specials, I really haven't had an item that I didn't like! The weather is perfect right now for a sunny patio lunch or fresh air dinner. Let's not forget the beer. My favorites are the Oatmeal Stout or the Peach. Their peach beer is legendary with low sweetness and a crisp refreshing taste. If you think cider is too sweet but like fruity flavor, this is your beer. The oatmeal stout is thick and hearty with no bitterness. Seasonal beers abound, pumpkin porter in the fall, I've seen an orange blossom, belgian white, barleywine, etc.Parking close can be a challenge on weekend nights, best to ride your bike if you're close enough. http://www.fourpeaks.com for a complete menu.Just go there already!~~#~1
A small bite goes a long way. I first was introduced to these brownies in '09 when I received a variety box with 12 sprites and a can of cocoa for Christmas. I love the packaging - the deep purple and brown on the box and wrapper. After devouring my first brownie, I was an instant fan. The card in the box said you can freeze the brownies for up to a month but it was gone within the week. The can of cocoa lasted for a good 3 months. I used it for baking - cookies, breads, cakes, etc. My faves: Cream Cheese, Espresso Nib, Toffee Crunch, and Caramel. The sprites are just the perfect size because it's just enough to get your chocolate fix but not overwhelming. I just throw one in my purse before I leave the house and I can have it with my coffee in the afternoon. I'm a subscriber of their email so I've been receiving emails with discount codes and free shipping. It's so hard to resist. Lucky me, I stumbled on a Groupon several months ago and I got a box of 24 Sprite for almost half the price plus shipping.~~#~1
I was going to take the time to write a scathing review, but I honestly can't even bring myself to do it. 1 star. That's all I can say.~~#~0

Vintage sodas sold by bottle, all of your grandmother's favorite childhood candy, an abundance of gag gifts and novelty items... you just can't dislike this place. Each time I'm in, I spend a good hour just perusing the countless Fred & Friends products and debating whether or not I should buy the stick-on-mustaches or 10 of the Chinese finger traps. But, let's be honest here. I mostly go for the photo booth. By far the best photo booth in town... good quality pictures (not cheap like the ones inside the mall) and they have little masks, glasses, and mustaches-on-a-stick you can use in case you're tired of flashing the peace sign or making that horrendous duck face.Soda. Candy. Toys. Photo booth. Don't kid yourself. You're never too old for that ish.~~#~1
I will never go here again. So disappointed when I went in its a cute store don't get me wrong I would buy so much there for my dog. But the day I went I went to get a treat for my dog for his birthday. The lady was on her phone the whole time talking personal business while my mother and I stood they're waiting for her to get off or put the person on hold. All we wanted to do was to ask her to get that dog cookie for us. So after 10 minutes of waiting we decided to leave and while walking out the door the lady shouted thanks for coming. That pissed me off cause she put down the phone to say bye but not to get an actual freaking sale. I'll continue going to to petsmart. Tried to support a local business but I guess when you own your own place you can have poor customer service~~#~0
Brown bag chicken sammich, mac n cheese, fried okra, and the bourbon drink.  Nuff said.~~#~1
A few weeks ago, I was receiving quotes to have my AC unit replaced due to the hail storm we had back in October. I had few companies come out but no one and I mean no one was as thorough as Dale with Mason Mechanical was. He spent 90 mins going over everything including climbing in the attic to check things out. He explained the differences between different units as well as what he and his team could do, which included taking out my furnace and installing a new ac/heat unit, pricing. etc.Fast forward 3 weeks later and I was able to get the appt set up to have my unit installed. Crystal set up everything for me  and she was fabulous, especially since I had to cancel the first time around due to my work schedule. (Thank you for your patience Crystal!!) Mike, the tech who was in charge of installing the new system called me promptly at 7am to let me know he was on his way and would be at my house within 30 mins. Fast forward 10 hours later and my new unit is installed. He explained everything to me including how to work my new programmable thermostat, made sure everything was in working order, sealed off the area in my now new closet (where the furnace was), made sure everything was cleaned up, and was just all around great. I am very happy that it was nice mild day here today because I don't know how they can do this in the summer.Thank you to the entire team at Mason Mechanical!~~#~1
A friend of a friend was telling us about this place on Sunday morning, and how awesome their pizza is.  It sounded awesome, but he warned us the line is usually an hour and a half long.  Oh well, we went anyway.  Luckily, we were early enough where we didn't have to wait long for a table.  When we were leaving, though, the line was easily an hour long.We started with the wings, which come in an order of 14 and were delicious.  Five of us were dining there, so we ordered two small pizzas, with each one being a half, so we had a nice variety of pizzas to try from.  We got the BBQ Chicken, the Frisco, Grandma G's, and one more that eludes me now.  All were pretty delicious, and I give them mad props for going out of their way to create unique pizzas with untraditional toppings (Grandma G's had potato on it).  Our entire bill with a few drinks came to under $80.Oh, make sure you sit outside... the inside had a lot of loud kids, and it seemed to echo off each wall and annoy the hell out of our party.  The women in our party also said the air temperature kept changing in there.  Keep in mind, too, that they don't have a full bar, so if you're going there hoping to start off with a bloody mary, you're out of luck.~~#~1
Horrible service. Barely acknowledged when you first walked in. Slow service and waited for my check for 20 minutes before getting up to go get it myself. Will not come again.~~#~0
I recently had sunscreens installed in my entire  home by CC Sunscreens....i did research and found CC had the best prices...Carl the owner was amazing....he came to measure the day after i called.  He answered all of our questions.  He gave us a great price and in less than a week the screens were professionally installed.  The screens are not only of the highest quality - they look great and make our home look brand new.  We noticed an immediate difference in the coolness of each room -   and we look forward to saving on our energy bill too!  We cant thank CC Sunscreens enough -   They are simply the best!~~#~1
Finally a Japanese owned sushi bar beside Sakana in Ahwatukee!  I guess Sushi Ken has been here for a while, but I didn't realize what a great find it was.  My wife and I went there to splurge on Japanese sushi since they are better than the typical Korean owned sushi places which are most common in the Phoenix area.  We found we didn't splurge at all as we do at Sakana or Hiro.  We didn't break $30, which surprised me.  5 stars for value and great sushi!Domo Arigato!~~#~1
This is not a fancy place.  It's address is on Scottsdale Road, but it's easier to get to from Shea, about a block east of Scottsdale.  It's split into two sections.  As you walk in, if you head to the left, there is a bar with a couple of pool tables.  I can't really say that I've spent any time in that section.  We head to the right, where there is a central bar, with booths along the walls.  If you are into Karoake, this is a great place to go.  The DJ has a great voice, and many of the usuals do as well (of course there are quite a few who don't, but that's to be expected).  We've been here dozens of times, and never not had a good time.  It's casual, and very reasonably priced.  The food is way above average for this casual of a bar.  The shrimp are spiced to perfection, and the chili is to die for.~~#~1
I needed new tires & 2 months later my husband. Both experiences the staff went out of their way to either get it done on time or make it work price wise! I have always used them for my tire needs and we travel for jobs so we need them a lot,~~#~1
The oatmeal cookie frozen yogurt here is amazing.  The place is small but accomodating enough to get your yogurt and find a seat.  It's similar to Yogurtini and the other places like this.  Last time I came here I saw a guy with the most awesome 80s blonde mullet I have ever laid eyes on. Rock on.~~#~1
My wife and I moved from Seattle in November of 2006. We thought we would find great, modern Mexican food all around the Valley. Fortunately we found it, but only at Barrio Cafe (so far). Barrio Cafe is a sure hit with anyone who loves Mexican food without a half plate of gray, canned refried beans. Their menu is excellent, thought put into the dishes inspired and the ingredients are fresh. It's well worth the hour wait.~~#~1
Downright awesome and extremely hip. A non-traditional, very out there, but very hidden coffee joint.You can't see this place from the street. It's kind of behind the Buffalo Exchange. It's almost the last place you would expect to find a coffee shop. As soon as you walk in there are really bright and vivid paintings, this is kind of what makes it way out there. Barista was very friendly and asked us how the weather was, always cool to have some small talk instead of the drone, "what can i get for you..." Wait, that basically sounds like the boring coffee-grinders at Starbucks.I gotta have my lattes. I will drink regular coffee sometimes, but my soft spot is a well made latte. Amazing enough, places like Starbucks just don't know how to make lattes, I give up on Starbucks. Their beans suck, and apparently their frothing machines do too, because everytime I go there it seems like they just warm my milk and mix it with some coffee. The latte here was PERFECT. The milk was perfectly frothy, which in my opinion is what makes a latte a latte. Coffee had a nice roasted flavor to it. Amazingly, there are tons of coffee shops out there that can't do decent lattes. This is my new coffee place.Good music choice here, its like new age elevator music, calm soothing hip hop and pop. Awesome atmosphere, quiet enough to study and have a conversation, yet lively enough to come for just a cup of caffeine. Skip the Starbucks and "Sex in the City" sorority girl drinks and come here.Only problem was that I think they only have small or large lattes, and it was like $4 for a large. That's like $0.50 to a $1 too much in my honest opinion. Oh well, I think I'd still pay that when I'm craving a latte.~~#~1
I learned of this company through a living social deal. I emailed them to set up an appointment. The earliest available date was a month later, I went ahead and scheduled the appointment in spite of the wait time. One month went by,  on the scheduled day of cleaning in which I was told they would arrive between 12 and 1... NO ONE shows up. I wait, at 3:30 I email asking why was this scheduled appointment not kept?... I've yet to get a response or an explanation.There are many cleaning companies out there, my suggestion - try a different one than Maid 4 it all.~~#~0
I was at The Rhythm Room and saw these cool people selling Tacos, so I checked it out. It turned out to effen awesome. Fresh quality food!  ChiChi- lisous! Be on the look out for these guys! Chow down baby.~~#~1
I was there on a Friday night with a few friends in the hopes of a quick drink and nosh after a show next door.My companion and I ordered basic drinks and were met with shots of liquor in the bottoms of our glasses and a blank look from the waitress when I asked if they were out of mixers.  After this, we opted not to order any food (taking our cue from the inability to mix gin with tonic water) and were met with an outrageous bill (for our two 'well' shots).  We questioned the tally and were met with a second total that wasn't much better.  Our credit card was charged twice: $40 for some wet ice and a lemon wedge.  There are many cool and artsy places in Phx where we can catch live music and nosh with friends.  I'll pass this one up from now on.~~#~0
Caught Louis CK here last night... Beautiful theater... absolutely stunning. It was clean, the staff was really nice, and parking was a breeze. The sound was great, the seats were comfy, and I can't really find anything to complain about. Truly one of the most gorgeous theaters I've seen - down to every detail - it's my new favorite... I love it. L.O.V.E.If you twisted my arm and forced me to complain - well, in the lobby where they were serving drinks, the line got a little excessive. It wasn't so bad really - but I tried both of the wine they were selling and I kinda hated them. This is more of a bit of advice for you to booze it up before you get there than it is a complaint. I can't recommend this place enough.~~#~1
Andrea has been a lifesaver- literally! She was watching over our furry monsters when our AC went out  in July and we were across the country. She not only made an extra visit just to see if the AC was broken, but helped us find an open kennel to get our cats boarded. She's been our creature sitter several times now, thankfully with less craziness.Her rates are very reasonable and she keeps in great contact with you. Her initial visit with us went over all the little things we wanted done (like picking up the paper and bringing it in) and was very thorough. Since she offers a full house sitter and pet sitter menu of services, she's knows things to cover that we had not thought of! She's very professional and is licensed and insured. Your animals will thank you!~~#~1
I had the terrible decision to make to euthanize my 20 year old cat, Bandit. I was going to go to the Emergency Animal Clinic off of Scottsdale Rd. further north but I had previously had a bad experience there. I saw there were some good reviews for this Emergency Animal Hospital and, thank God I did. They were so kind and compassionate. They let us take our time, never rushed us. They knew it was a very painful thing to have to do. They made one of the worst things I have ever had to do as 'easy' as they possibly could have. They eased my nagging doubts about it without putting words in my mouth. I am ever grateful for their kindness on that incredibly sad day and would recommend them to anyone who has an animal friend who needs some emergency care.~~#~1
I love this Gelato! My favorite combination is the panna cotta with the mint chocolate chip. Weird but wonderful. I am rarely down this way, especially since I've moved, but I still fantasize about digging in to this deliciousness!  I only ever had great service, and fantastic product here. So far it is the best Gelato I've had, although I hear Arlecchino's is pretty fantastic as well. I miss visiting Angel Sweet, I will have to go back soon.~~#~1
I love Pizza-A-Metro and so does Joe Arpaio. I am quite certain it is the only thing we have in common.This is where I take my foodie friends because they are usually so busy eating they shut up for a while. (I kid, I kid...) I have never had anything here that I don't find super delicious and crave-worthy. The first time I went here my party was personally doted on by Maurizio, who was over-the-top gracious and seemed to truly love what he was doing.  While I don't see him every time I am here, the service never suffers.The calamari is crisp and light, which is a nice change from heavy, fried calamari that is so ubiquitous in too many Italian joints. Hands down my favorite item on the menu is the Frescolina. The combination of the arugula and prosciutto makes my mouth water even thinking about it!So next time you are at Pizza-A-Metro, my advice is don't loudly discuss if the portly man next to you is Joe Arpaio. Don't look him up on your Blackberry and pass the photo around to get the opinion of your fellow diners. Don't bring up that his mother died in childbirth, and how that potentially explains a great deal of the man's 'politics.' No matter how much wine you have had, do not forget how small this restaurant is. Because in the end, after he and his bodyguards leave, the server will tell you- Yeah. That was him.~~#~1
Great Kobe on flatbread and the skirt steak is fantastic. Waiters are very attentive and helpful. I've eaten here twice in the days (conference) and I would go back. Their menu is diverse enough to try something new again.~~#~1
...NOW WE'RE TALKIN'! Killer Mexican Food! The chips 'n salsa kicks ass! You get a red, blue & regular tortilla chips with reg, spicy salsa & bean dip! Hellava start! A kick-butt margarita! Had Chicken Fajitas!...THE BEST! Cannot wait to return! Great ambiance.~~#~1
Great selection of vitamins and supplements, good prices and I can get the special treats our cat likes while I'm picking up the goods for myself. Plus their rewards program is pretty straightforward.I also like that they are not "all over you" like the other local chain is when you walk in the door. I highly recommend the Vitamin Shoppe on Camelback!~~#~1
Went here for a work function today. What can I say, this place is awesome! A great variety of meats all cooked to perfection. My favorite was the bacon wrapped filet, yum!Nice salad bar with good variety as well, instead of bacon bits, they have a bowl full of uncrumbled bacon.Lastly a slice of cheesecake with strawberries, mmm.Simply awesome stuff! Taking the wife when I can.~~#~1
I'm not going to lie - I indulged in fantasies about Howard Roark during the course of my 90-minute Insights tour. His spirit and convictions were brought to life by FLW and being in this incredible complex where he lived, worked and taught was indescribably cool.  The tour takes you around the property and through many of the rooms, restored to various periods of Frank's life. I was a bit dismayed at the disrepair some of the rooms are in, so I spent money in the gift shop hoping it will go to repairing some sad looking chairs and windowpanes.  Overall, the tour guides are genius at describing and making you feel like you're seeing things through FLW's eyes with his vision on architecture and lifestyle.  This is not to be missed!~~#~1
Donuts are worst I've ever had. I bought 2 dozen donuts using their 10.99 sale and it was the worst donuts I have ever had in my life. All the donuts were dry and stale. I should have gone a couple of miles over and bought Krispy Kreme. Krispy Kreme donuts are always fresh. These ones were worst that those that sat on the shelf for a week in a supermarket!~~#~0
This is the best Cajun place in Arizona. The portions are great and the people behind the counter are really nice. I love gumbo and I have tried several kinds here and all of them were excellent. Yes the decor isn't 5 stars but seriously if you're more worried about mood lighting and soft cushions you can go to Pappadeaux's and get charged an arm and a leg for lower quality food. the drive and the price are definitely worth it for this place.~~#~1
The Rosson House Museum is a restored home from the 1895's.  And it's also conveniently right next to the Teeter House Tea Room and across from Pizzeria Bianco.  For under $5, you can take a guided tour of Rosson House and learn what life was like for its residents so long ago. It's a really cool activity to do, and since it's close to so many great restaurants, you can go for dinner and drinks after your tour. Walking through the home, it's easy to imagine the lady of the house sipping tea in a dainty cup with her lacy gloves on. Or maybe it's just me. Houses like this tend to creep me out. I half-expected to see a ghostly woman in a pinafore around every corner, but let me tell you, I'm glad I didn't. Either way, coming to Heritage Square and exploring the historic buildings in it is a great way to spend an afternoon.~~#~1
Dr. Dairiki is terrific. She is professional, listens to you and explains things so that you know exactly what she is talking about. I have never had to wait and the other thing I like is that she calls you back personally to let you know test results or if you have questions (plus it is done in a timely fashion.)~~#~1
These dentists are great at explaining medical issues in a way that you can understand. They are honest and very smart. They don't take my insurance and I still go there (lets face it, dental insurance doesn't reimburse much, so it's only like a $15 difference for me to go out of network for a cleaning). I would never go anywhere else!~~#~1
I have been coming here since 1996 and the food just keeps on getting better!!!   The jerk fried rice and emerald chicken are to die for and he snicker doodle cookies....oh my goodness.   Every time I'm in phoenix, this is my must go see do eat spot!!  The owner Frank is awesome.~~#~1
I will have to disagree with many of the previous writers here.  I have been to Michael Minna in San Francisco, which is way more famous and crowded but this one is better.  Let's begin with something that impressed me.  When my partner and I sat down, someone came over and immediately handed her a black cloth napkin.  Sounds simple, but it's nice when you have nice black pants on and don't want white crap all over them.  Second, the food was great.  The duck fries were really good (and free)... I had a great corn chowder with cilantro and a small grilled cheese sandwich which was perfect. (I never eat those). My main course was a skirt steak in a fantastic sauce.  My dessert was beignets and creme brulee.  The beignets were great and the creme brulee was good.  (My gf makes it much better)...we each had two drinks, a pear martini which was excellent and an even better white cosmo.  All in all, the food was tasty and the appearance of the place was nice and swanky.  It's about time Scottsdale started opening restaurants that can compete with S.F. and NY.~~#~1
Our server Amanda was awesome with her suggestions and service! Would go here again in a heart beat!~~#~1
Is it illegal to have good Chinese good in Arizona?  We went tonight having high hopes of having high quality, fresh Chinese food and we were sorely disappointed.:(We opened our take out bag and the white rice had been left off of the order...we were going to give them a pass for that...but on the flavor issue...there are no excuses...The Peeking Dumplings were wilted and flavorless.  The sauce that went with them could not revive them.  The Chinese mustard was in little packets and had no heat...Viagra needed:(!The Mongolian Beef was so salty it tasted processed.The snap peas were stringy and overcooked.The General Chow's Chicken...it tasted old like it was off an all you can eat buffet.Honestly...Panda Express is better...as least you know what to expect in a mall food court.It wasn't cheap...and I'm not a food volume person but the portions were small...I was fine with it because who would want more of this plate of shame!I hope they can get there act together...but I fear the owner may be in over his head...Isn't there a Chinese Chef in town who needs  a job!~~#~0
This QT is one of my favorite locations! It is always very clean and the staff is upbeat!~~#~1
The hula burger was awesome! Great service. The hostess is very kind and sweet. What a great find!~~#~1
Found this place through Yelp and a Yelping buddy so there you have it...the power of Yelp because we absolutely LOVED this place.  Tucked into a neighborhood you have a very cozy, eclectic little joint.  From the start to the end we received extremely friendly service. We of course tried the foods suggested in previous reviews and by the server.  The pasta fries were unique, light and paired with great tasting sauces.  A definite dish you have to try.  We also tried the figs stuffed with chorizo.  Also very good & savory.  But the ABSOLUTE FAVORITE of the night were the chicken and waffles!  My gosh is this the dish to come to the Tuck Shop for.  The chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside.  The waffles were served with a butter that seemed to be whipped with possibly honey and the syrup was just the right sweet.  All the flavors seemed to work with just the right amount of sweet and savory.  The grilled fresh green beans were the perfect side.  I think I would get this dish over and over and over again.  Then I would go back and get it again.  Great place we will frequent often.  P.S. They make their own tonic.  Yep, their own tonic.  GREAT tasting!  Try it with the vodka they serve (haven't heard of it before but was very pleased).~~#~1
Loved this place since it open but they have changed their menu up a little and it seems they have cut corners and products out of there repartee.  The sandwich I got this weekend was very bland and somewhat disappointing in portion size I've grown accustom to at the "WBC" and they've discontinued making their bread salad. (Very disappointing)  I will be back but with fewer expectations I guess.I received an apology letter from the founder and an offer to refund my money.  I don't need a refund... this is not what Yelp is about, but it was really refreshing to know that a company still cares about their customers reviews.  After re reading my review it may have sounded worse than my experience actually was.  The sandwich I got was a new one from their menu named the Spicy Chipotle Egg Sandwich, it was good but I like SPICY!!!  I may order it again and just ask for an extra egg and some more chipotle sauce.  The gentleman did give me the recipe for the salad that I've enjoyed in the past.   This type of service is what makes a customer for life.~~#~1
There are few resources in Arizona for dancers, actors and performers, so it's best to order online if you have the time to wait for shipping. Dee's Dancewear is overpriced and because they know they are the only game in town, their customer service (and return policies) have suffered.In an emergency situation, you're better suited going to Mischa's Dancewear on 33rd Ave and Bell or Capezio's in Scottsdale. Otherwise, order online and steer clear of this establishment when possible.~~#~0

Every item that I tried was amazing. Owner made it a pleasant environment and he had a terrific voice. A must try in Central Phoenix.~~#~1
While visiting Arizona we were told we must try Macayo's. The margaritas (fruit flavored and blended) were a bit on the sweet side- to the extent that I was worried I might get a tooth ache. The prices here are very reasonable. I had the fajita quesadilla, delicious- I cant stop thinking about it. The service was friendly and somewhat efficient. This isn't a place you go for decor and ambiance- but they do have outside seating, always a plus in my book.~~#~1
Oh, how I miss this Goodwill store, which opened in September 2011. I moved to North Carolina in March 2012, and have not been able to find anything like it here. Large, clean, and very well organized, this store is thrift shop heaven. And it's all for a good cause: there's a job center right on site that helps people find work. Go on Thursdays, if you can, when a designated tag color is just $1. I've purchased a lot of name brand clothing here for $1 per piece. You can also check out certain Saturdays when everything in the store is half price. I got a great mirror that matched the dresser in my guest bedroom for $12.50. This place is so good, I would not be writing this review if I still lived in Arizona, because I would want to keep all the bargains to myself.~~#~1
So freaking good.  The drinks are great too.  Ask for "the icon" not on menu, but very good!Love everything I had there!  Service is great and food is absolutely delicious!  Wish I lived closer!~~#~1
Chipotle is my go to place when I feel like picking up a quick meal, and this happens to be my local one.Always busy, and you'll almost always see someone you know getting some delicious Chipotle as well.Portions are huge, but no complaining because it's all delicious!~~#~1
I remember when this was Fry's...back in the 70's. I think it's great when these older buildings are put to good use instead of being torn down for another new strip mall. What a perfect place for an Antique Mall.This is a store that you could spend hours and hours really looking at everything. This Antique Mall has TONS of GREAT Antique finds...like REAL antique and retro STUFF, not recent overpriced crap that most Antique Dealers throw in their booth and try to pass off as something worth a lot of money. There are things here that I haven't ever seen at other Antique stores before.I quickly walked down the aisles, the prices seemed pretty good and yet some that seemed OVERPRICED. I wonder if Antique Dealers are wanting to sell merchandise or pay monthly rent to store their museum. Believe it or not, you can still get BETTER deals on ebay.Several of the booths seemed like they had a theme, like stepping back into that time era... they were merchandised nicely.The restroom even looked like some grandmother's tacky bathroom decor, it really fit in well with the antique feeling.I will definitely come back here when I have more time to shop..~~#~1
This review is based solely on service - not the food. I am sitting in a booth at RA as I type this - that is how upset I am with the host staff at ra. I called ahead to inform the restaurant that we would have a party of 8. When we arrived the girls at the front were so rude I almost walked out. We waited 35 min for our table and the entire time the host staff was looking my entire group up and down giving us the "stink eye". I am sorry that you are 18 years old, work for $8 and have a stick up your butt, but do not make us feel unwelcome. My girlfriend and I went to the back to use the bathroom - the host followed us back and asked us what we were doing - not to help us find the bathroom but just to be a snob. From here on out ra is ruined for me.~~#~0
One of the best restaurant in town. I have been there few times and they really manage to wow me every time ! The owner if nice and friendly and is really on top of things. The service is great and the food is amazing ! We are going again this Saturday and I can't wait to taste their New Years eve menu. Happy New year :)~~#~1
Was in a few weeks ago and had the white bean chicken chili. superfantasticdeliciousness.  i've only had one meal out of about 20 here that i didn't like.  Wildflower is one of our favorite afternoon places to grab a bite.Thanks, Louis!~~#~1
hamburgessa heaven.  Guac and bacon on a burger is ingenious.  I do wish they had some curly fries or something but the burgers cant be beat.  Also, the condiment BAR is brilliant~~#~1
FILLY-B's!!!!!  only 8 reviews?? NINE now!!!wow do i miss THIS place:- 24hrs- drive-thru or walk up only- ridiculously cheap- ridiculously tastyof course the arizona burritos are good, everything is good. i used to LOVE one of the combos... you get a beef burrito, taco, rice and beans... for UNDER $6.  wow.  color me silly and call me sally. they have bomb horchata too.really good and fresh flautas/rolled tacos and breakfast burritos. damn, everything here is good, whether drunk or sober.~~#~1
Definitely one of the best barbers on the westside of town. Ely takes his time and makes sure you are satisfied. I have tried a few different barbers around town and this is the best spot by far! I recommend this spot if you're looking for a great and friendly barber!~~#~1
If you haven't been to this place - go! Seriously. It's amazing. It's the best little hole-in-a-rundown-strip-mall you can find. And it's cheap!Nestled between stores like Big Lots and some electronic place with Mexican ranchero music blasting, this tiny place is hidden in the corner. The owner is from El Salvador, so don't expect it to be Mexican food -- there are many similarities, but the dishes themselves are different.Walking in, you can smell the homemade pupusas -- seriously, it smells like the roadside stands along the bus routes in central America. It's amazing. There are only a couple waitresses, and I don't think they speak much English, but the menu is in pictures, as well as in Spanish and some English, so you should do just fine.Get the pupusas - they're like thick, hand-made tortillas stuffed with either pork, cheese and beans or, my favorite, cheese and loraco flower, which is some green and edible plant that tastes a bit like asparagus, to me. It's definitely the best one. These things come with salsa and some coleslaw (if they don't, just ask for the salsa) and are very filling!The other dishes are really good, too. For a low price, you can get an entire plate of things like meat with rice and beans - and this place doesn't skimp on the fixin's. They put slices of fresh tomatoes, avocado and all kinds of other stuff on the plates.I honestly LOVE it here. If you want to avoid the crowds, come at an off-hour... then you can just sit, relax and watch the telenovela on the TV in the corner. For dessert, pick up a piece of the cheese pie near the cash register.I can't recommend this place enough!~~#~1
Honey jalapeño chicken lollipops and sweet potato tots are probably some of the most delicious things ever.~~#~1
I have never been treated so rudely in a retail establishment ever. I went to the shop with my daughter, her friend and my niece...all young adults. I showed a picture of the project we wanted make to the woman working there and she scoffed at me.  I noticed she was playing Solitaire on her iPad...apparently we interrupted her game. She then proceeded to tell us that she would have to open the door and turn on the air conditioner because her mother, the owner of the store, would be back soon and is extremely allergic to fragrance.  The girls and I had body lotion on, this is the desert for crying out loud, and not one of us had perfume on.  Then the mother arrived, there was a brief conversation behind the curtain and she walk out with a towel over her mouth and nose commenting on having to open the door. Seriously? Unfortunately we had picked out some stuff to buy and I'm sorry that I spent the $68. I could have spent more but the experience was so distasteful that we hurried out. If I knew how to give less than 1 star, I would. It was unbelievable. I empathize with the woman and her allergies, but the situation could have been handled so much better.~~#~0
I don't think anyone who gave over a 2 has ever eaten Italian food in Chicago. I struggled to give 2 stars, but figured the wings were decent .#1) No celery salt on the Dog#2) No cucumber on the Dog#3) WORST OF ALL the GYRO, was not off a spit it was processed#4) Also, living 30 years in Chicago I have never had a gyro covered in more lettuce than there were onioins. #5) Since when does a Gyro (not in Chicago) have Feta Cheese & almost not Tatziki#6) The PIZZA IS NOT CHICAGO STYLE ITS 100% New York#7) Wings are a 6 out of 10#8) THERE IS NO DEEP DISH PIZZA OFFERED OR THICK CRUST???#9) I apologize they have now gone from 2 to 1 star... PLEASE CHANGE YOUR NAME YOU"RE A DISGRACE TO CHICAGO!!!Don't think I will give this place another shot no reason~~#~0
I am in love with this place. Everything is delicious. I have been in a few times now and hands down the best thing there is the asian mushroom soup. The portion size is perfect for lunch. They offer a sampling of 3 soups with bread, which is perfect since I can't ever make up my mind. Last time was in Janet was serving roasted red pepper and sausage frittatas and bacon and egg soup both of which were excellent.~~#~1
I booked our anniversary trip to the Westin Kierland through Priceline.  It was so reasonably priced that I was a bit concerned it would lack quality, and after reading a few reviews on Trip Advisor I was worried.  I was COMPLETELY wrong.  This is a 5 star resort from the moment you park your car.  The front desk staff upgraded our room, and this very nice gentleman greeted us with a smile every single time we passed through the lobby.  They have golf carts available to drive you to your rental car.  The food in Deseo is amazing.  I would definitely recommend trying the ceviche sampler and the muddled cocktails.  I can't forget to mention the amazing bread made with tapioca flour, they will even give you the recipe. We especially enjoyed talking to the girls in the information center (the one that looks like a mine).  They were VERY helpful in giving us advice on local restaurants and insisting we take a day trip to Sedona......we did and Sedona is now one of our favorite cities. Thanks to Ashley, Miranda, Tiffany, Chelsea, and Pat.  When we returned from our Sedona day trip, we had chips & salsa, and two cold coronas.  This was a very thoughtful touch.If you are looking for a fine dining experience, Mastros Ocean Club is right across the street and has incredible food.  I highly recommend the lobster mashed potatoes and the seared scallops.  Back to the resort.......our room had a great view of the golf course which was massive.  Although we are not golfers, we certainly enjoyed the view.  Our room was a pretty good size and the Heavenly Beds are my absolute favorite.  When traveling I will do my very best to ensure we stay at a Westin Resort.~~#~1
I see a lot of four stars...perhaps I'm too generous with my five stars. I'm a giver.Attended a party for Georgie on Friday night and had a great time. Easy to find, easy to park, easy to get a drink. Plus- HEY they have the same turbo nozzle a/c vents that I have in my home. I could live there. Exposed brick? Me too! Felt right at home.I love the way they display their art, I'm assuming from local artists. I would prefer to not have to walk down a flight of stairs after a night of drinking. However, no problems there - thankfully. :)~~#~1

Love this store!  Were really helpful when I helped plan a replica white house dinner for DESERT SHADOWS MIDDLE SCHOOL for 370 7th graders.  Gave me a discount on the party supplies I purchased for the event.  Even called others stores to find me the extra stuff they didn't have.  Love their halloween section too.  It's my one stop shop for parties!~~#~1
Let me preface this review ..I have lived in this area for 15 years and Chompie's has been the only option for good Jewish deli. In my 51 years I have never received worse service than from Chompie's They ALWAYS get the order wrong., Tonight after much debate I caved for my daughter who has strep throat. She wanted nothing else but matzah ball soup to make her feel better. So reluctantly I called in for take out at Chompies. I assumed the one thing on there menu that might be a safe bet and hard to screw up would be the soup. I returned home and called my daughter in to tell her I got what the doctor ordered. As I watched her pour it in the bowl we noticed it was missing one key ingredient......... THE SOUP!!!!!  When I decided to call and tell Chompies this has to be the 10th or 12 time in a row they have screwed up our order. This was more than screwing up a order. This was forgetting the soup in SOUP. They told me if I wanted the broth I should have asked for it in a separate container. I responded I didn't think I had to ask for broth in soup! I WILL NEVER GIVE THEM A DIME OF MY MONEY AGAIN.  I highly recommend to drive the additional 15-20 minutes in your car and find somewhere else when looking for jewish comfort food. You will be highly disappointed with Chompies. This is the first time I have ever heard of yelp. My son told me to come on here because this is a way to tell other people to avoid restaurants such as these. I hope you take my advice.~~#~0
Warning, don't get deterred that there aren't any seats for you when you walk in... that's a good sign that the the tables are full with everyone stuffing their faces.  I waited for about 15 minutes for a table to free up, and I'm glad I did.  It was kind of a chilly night and I was feeling for something hot.  I decided on the seafood noodle soup and pork pies.  The noodles soup broth was lightly seasoned with a hint of white pepper (just the way I like it), the noodles were thick and hearty, and the portion was substantial.  The pork pies (3) were like a flattened pot sticker that had been pan-fried on both sides, Yum!Definitely, a place serving up genuine Chinese food with the finesse of a home-cooked meal. I can't wait to go back!~~#~1
I chose this place because of the 100% rating on urbanspoon.com & the proximity to the hotel my family was staying at. We were absolutely blown away. Don't let the location of a strip mall deter you from this place. The food is absolutely perfect. I had the bouillabaisse while my 2 table mates had steak. Each dish was prepared perfectly. The service was also some of the best service we have ever had at any restaurant. The waitress was so attentive & detail oriented. I never had to ask for anything, she always knew exactly what I needed. My water & iced tea was never below halfway. At the end of the meal, the owner/chef came out to greet us & that was such a nice gesture. We were so happy to compliment him & his restaurant. My visiting family even said that they would gladly come back to this place on their next visit. This place is so great & you just need to go visit it!~~#~1
Mojo's was my favorite till I tried Menchies..much better flavors like Chocolate Covered Banana and even Pumpkin (awesome) for their seasonal!  Lots of flavor, very rich, clean & priced at about what they charge at mojos..maybe a little more but Im not sure!~~#~1
Went here before a Phx Suns game. DELICIOUS! Everything on the menu looked amazing. I forgot what it was called, but the open-faced steak sandwich was my favorite! All the dishes were even presented nicely! Will definitely eat here again!~~#~1
i love, love, love the high level of customer service that paul and his staff provide at central car care.  i recommend them to all my friends.  good service, nice people, great prices, reliable.....  what more can you ask for?~~#~1
Only 10 min away from walking distant.This is really really really good, also really really really bad.I am almost finished with trying each soynami.... So far and not a fan of the one with banana.YET EVERYTHING is.... just... just good. Place on top of a Swiss Alp let me sing, dance, and exclaiming goodness oozing. Also i can eat one and not feel lik I am creating havoc for my metabolism to compensate.RL:NOTE: Oddly takes an unusually amount of time to get into my hands. 10min?Worth the wait, worth the walk, worth the extra chocolate ;)~~#~1
Great restaurant!  I had the brisket sandwich and loved it.  They bring out fresh cornbread before the meal which is a bonus and small little donuts for after the meal.  The restaurant has a great decor and is a very pleasant atmosphere. If you want some good ol fashion barbecue- try this place out, you won't be let down~~#~1
Sushi is not just a meal, it's an experience...Everything from the way fish looks to the crisp green of the seaweed is art.  The smell of the sake and the sound of crisp sizzle on the grill create an environment conducive to stretching the palette.  Yasu's does this like no other sushi place...The fish is pristine, the rice like air, and the flavors intense and varied.  My wife and I live a stone's throw from this place you would never see it if you didn't know it was there.  It's like a little secret that is starting to get out...All I can say is that it is hands down the BEST sushi in Phoenix, period.  Get the fried oyster rolls, get the grilled mackerel or trout...just try it!~~#~1
01/04/2012I thank Yelp and ATC for giving me the great opportunity to experience a terrific performance of "Daddy Long Legs," ATC's first musical production, at The Herberger Theater tonight!  The two-actor (Megan McGinnis and Robert Adelman Hancock) musical, plus the invisible, but great assets, the orchestra and sound crew, entertained and amazed me w/ their execution of a well-written body of work.  It had comedy, romance, deception, and sorrow, to name a few... what's not to like?  Truly enjoyed McGinnis' impeccable timing, as well.  It is sad that many people pass up the opportunity to watch live theater due to the higher ticket fees, and I cannot fault them-- what's easier to bear: $37 per person plus $3 parking fee, which you may buy at the box office prior to attending the show, or $10 and free parking at the movies (well, at least when you're NOT catching one in downtown PHX)?  However, when you do decide to place the financial investment, you will almost always be rewarded w/ a highly-memorable night, believe you me!  I had a wonderful time, and I would definitely recommend "Daddy Long Legs" to anyone who enjoys great acting and music!  (Much thanks to McGinnis and Hancock for their lovely harmonies-- I cherished them!)~~#~1
I'd go back the next time I'm in town.  Its friendly in here.  My friends and I just went in here to peek but we were presented in glasses of rose.  It was good, so I checked their stores of champagne (I like it pink).  I should have bought a bottle but we were on our way to an interview or dinner.~~#~1
Ah what a beauty and wonder Camelback mountain is. However I do warn beginners to use the easier trail on the East side near Invergorden which runs north south and turns into 64th st. It is a bit of a walk from the parking through the neighborhood but the hike is less treacherous and much easier and takes you up a gradual slope to the top. Be very careful it's easy to loose the trail on that side too. Of course all the Phoenicians like to go to Echo Canyon at Mcdonald and 44th street bend. Parking can be bad at peak times on weekends--I definetely recommend late afternoon hiking, less exhaustion from heat, less crowds and a glorious sunset at the top. Happy Hiking my Dear Phoenicians.~~#~1
Very friendly staff, or a fast food place-- their customer service and friendliness is unmatched.. I go more often than not simply because of the experience every time! Thanks Micky!~~#~1
Love massages and facials!I would highly recommend Enrique for a massage.  Great technique.  Great membership prices and great walk-in schedule for those last minute needs.~~#~1
This place is so unique! I was disappointed that it was closed the weekend of my birthday in July, but I won't hold that against them!This bar/boxing ring/vintage store/food truck/soda fountain is super awesome! My cousin took me here a few years ago and since then it's been a place that I always show friends and family members when they want to go out downtown. The drink list is pretty extensive, with lots of organic cocktails served in cute mason jars. You definitely get a good sized drink! The beers are cheap, the food is so-so. I think it's a bit overpriced, so I'd recommend eating somewhere else beforehand. The boxing ring is random, but I've seen friends go up there and fight in a drunken stupor, and that is a sight I'll never regret seeing. Some nights they have karaoke, which I've chosen to partake in a few times. I've seen DJ's there on the weekends, and I really like how they switch up the music genre each time. Sometimes it's rap, others rockabilly and oldies. On Tuesday nights they do FREE swing dancing lessons and I've been really wanting to try that!i love the vintage feel to the place and am surprised it's not packed all the time!~~#~1
Haven't been here since 1997! Man, now all the memories are back and can't wait to get situated in AZ for a couple days! ;-)~~#~1
Why would I go to a restaurant and hope for the worst?  Because I'm a snob and as a snob I was convinced that The Capital Grille would fall short of my extremely high expectations.  Not so.Bread basket: Outstanding onion bread, a pumpernickel/golden raisin bread, and some crisp cracker bread.  Nice all around.Extensive wines by the bottle with some great values to be had.  I did not check by the glass.  Our wine was decanted artfully at our table and the staff had a ready knowledge of the vineyard and year we had selected.Husband had:Oysters -  Blue point tonight, small this time of year so no big surprise there, well prepared and delicious.Lamb chop - Perfectly flavored and cooked, Frenched, the definition of how to prepare and cook a lamb chop perfectly.Potato Au Gratin - Typical steakhouse Au gratin.  Excellent flavor, huge portion, guaranteed to please a crowd (or anyone that loves a delicious cheesy crusted potato).I had:Prosciutto Wrapped Mozzarella - You can't imagine how good this is....a lovely thin slice of prosciutto cooked to crisp perfection wrapped around a fresh piece of mozzarella cheese, with just the right amount of melt but not escaping the prosciutto shell.  A parmesan toast and tomato salad round this out.  You might as well as shaved gold on the side.Sliced filet - I'm not going to go into detail, just know that the answer is YES! (Is it fantastic? Is it cooked to perfection? Is the flavor wonderful? Is it a great cut?)Asparagus with Hollendaise - Awesome stuff.  Nice to have a great hollendaise that I didn't have to prepare.Service - Our server was so outstanding I'm going to contact the manager at this location.Atmosphere - We had a corner table that gave us great privacy.  We could not hear our neighbors.~~#~1
Brought a group to Metro for brunch, made the reservation a month ago, called three days ago to update and ask to be outside and people arrived and were told there was no reservation. Finally spoke with the manager and had that sorted out but when I asked for our tables outside and they couldn't accommodate. Having the bartender wait on a party of 18 was idiotic. Not enough menus, slow, horrible drinks, no silverware, soup was burnt-how do you burn soup??? Attempting to fix the situation with beignets was a nice attempt until we heard the server swearing about having to deal with us. I host events all over the valley and never have I experienced service as horrible as I did at Metro. They have recently changed management, unfortunately the great reviews I read when I made the reservation don't hold true anymore.Update 11/8/2010Since my first review I received a $50 gift certificate from the management of Metro.  I decided to go for dessert last Friday night with 5 of my friends.  I knew I couldn't just go with one other person, it had to be a group to show what they could do.  We arrived at 9:15 and were seated on the patio.  I met the general manager and she was pleasant enough, I never saw her again.  There was no one seated inside and the patio was half full.Jesse greeted us and was the most attentive and understanding server when two guests needed to return their drinks to the bar because they were not made properly - it was a specialty drink from their cocktail menu.We ordered beignets, apple bread pudding and triple chocolate delight.  The beignets and apple bread pudding were good.  The triple chocolate delight had absolutely no chocolate flavor at all.Jesse was by far an excellent server and if you go ask to be seated in his section.~~#~0
4 stars for the place itself and it's food/coffee.0 stars for the service, or lack there of.  My business partner and I were in town for a convention.  We heard we should check out Lola.  So we did.  We were excited.  The lady (I use the term loosely here) who took our order was LESS than patient OR helpful.  We asked a few questions.  She barely answered us, then when we had to repeat the question she was nothing short of annoyed.  An example.  We asked where we could get a glass or cup of water.  She mumbled something about the bar/table.  My partner walked over and saw no cups.  She came back and asked where the cups were.  On the table came an exasperated retort.  I walked over to inspect for myself.  There were no cups on the table.  So I kindly asked her if the cups should be on the table, if so there appeared to be none.  She said they are on the table, but *sigh* I'll go check, but I know they're there!  10 seconds later she comes out of the kitchen with a tube of cups.  IMAGINE THAT the customer was right.  I watched this lady serve other customers.  It appears that regulars are treated with a smile and courtesy and patience.  Newcomers or people she doesn't like are treated worse than the dirt on the bottom of her shoes.My suggestion to management, adjust her attitude or get rid of her!  She is not good for business.~~#~0
Came here with a bunch of the crew from work during lunch, and wow! This hidden gem on the corner of Indian School & 48th Street is a must visit if you're in the Arcadia area. The food here is amazing, and there's such a wide variety including delicious tater tots (even sweet potato tater tots) and the mouth watering reuben that I had chosen. You get a good sized portion as well. Thank goodness for take-home boxes! The restaurant is very spacious, and the staff is really friendly & laid back but get you seated and eating your food in no time. It gets better; the price of the food is VERY reasonable, in fact, I'm kind of shocked how inexpensive they are. A well deserved five stars!~~#~1
First time eating Chicken and waffles and it was the best time ever.~~#~1
I never knew green chilies were more valuable than gold. We ordered a dozen red tamales and a dozen green chilies. The person taking our order was not happy that we did not give them a 24 hour notice that their "gourmet tamales" require for such a large order. The red tamales were as dry as sawdust and the green chilies came with one small sliver of chili. The "hot Sauce" they have is nothing more than enchilada sauce with red chili flake added. Next time I'll just go to Del Taco where two dozen .40 cent tacos do not require a 24 hr notice from a family of 6.~~#~0
I went to cowboy ciao for my birthday and was very pleased with it! My family typically likes to get a bunch of stuff and share so we started with a chopped salad, the shrimp appetizer and the mushroom appetizer. The shrimp were cooked perfectly and the mushrooms were really flavorful and delicious, however, the chopped salad was the star of the night! It was so good I ended up ordering another one because the first one was devoured so fast. I typically don't think of salads as memorable dishes but this is by far the best salad I have ever had and I would come back just for the chopped salad. To finish it all off, the server brought me a huge piece of delicious chocolate cake on a plate that said happy birthday which was a nice touch! I would definitely recommend this restaurant - great atmosphere and even better food!~~#~1
Love it here. Come regularly now lol thanks to everyone on yelp. Great food cheap price great service. Tho not 100 percent authentic Chinese food still great~~#~1
Absolutely beautiful grounds. Golf course, restaurants, shops, botanical gardens, tennis courts...it's all beautiful. Definitely book a room here as opposed to the main section of the hotel - I'm not exactly sure what the difference is, but it IS a different (and smaller) building.Our room itself was nice, but the view was what made it amazing. From the balcony, you can see the golf course, the mountain, desert views, cactus...everything. And the service was great.The only complaint is that when I booked my stay, I was told that each guest would be assigned an "Ambassador" who would help ensure a great stay, or whatever. But throughout my weekend, this supposed Ambassador was never mentioned and didn't show up. Not a big deal, but if you're going to promise that service, then you better deliver.Otherwise, great stay. I would highly recommend this hotel. Great for a relaxing weekend.~~#~1
What  a beautiful facility. Attention to detail is what this place is about and the army of workers each takes his / her portion of the details and does a mighty fine job. If you want a high end place to stay. This is a good choice. When I made my hotwire reservation and ended up here, I got the deal of the century! I am sure the rack rate is high, but if you want comfort and great facility. this would be a wonderful choice! Oh yes, Everyone and I mean everyone was soooo nice. The gardeners,  the cleaning staff, the front desk, the parking attendant, all of them were super nice and fun and genuinely happy to be of service..~~#~1
I moved to AZ about five months ago and have had two tragically bad haircuts from two other "salons." I wear my hair in a short pixie cut and it's very hard to find someone with the skills to do it right so I don't  end up with a mans cut.I found Epic Salon here on Yelp and decided to give it a try.I could not be more pleased.  My appointment yesterday was with Chey and she's wonderful. I am very exacting when it comes to how I like my hair cut and am fluent in industry terms so I can articulate what I want.Chey listened very well and understood what I wanted. She totally delivered. I am so very relieved to have found her.  And at $26 (cut only, no blow out) it's a real deal.~~#~1
I do love rum and should review the Rum Bar separately but both the Rum Bar and the Breadfruit restaurant are equally awesome! Great recommendations from the waiter... Brown Stew Chicken and Jerk Chicken are really good... really spicy on the jerk chicken but thats somewhat expected and perfect for me! I'll take my plantains baked over fried any day! SO GOOD! Really great place to go for not so typical food! The entire place is quite small in a perfect intimate way.  Their seems to be a lot of pride in the menu, environment and service, which is rare to see in restaurant employees. Not to mention a perfect location ... very walkable to other nearby bars and easy to make a whole night of downtown phoenix!~~#~1
Worst store in the chain - I agree with one poster that it's not crowded but it also is out of items more than any other store.  It also is so understaffed it's impossible to get help if you need it and if you ask someone that works here that you finally locate, my experience is that they wont know what your asking for anyway.  I recently was in the store asking about a certain item by Susan Lenart Kazmer, the person looked right at me and said oh we don't carry that artist you might try hobby lobby they get a little credit for trying to help but Susan's line is a Michaels only item.  I gave the woman the line name and said no we don't carry that I'm sure.  I pointed at the huge display in front of me of Susan items and her answer, Oh that must be brand new.  I said nope it came out three years ago now can you see if you have this specific item she said oh we can't do that and she walked off talking to her friend the only other employee in the store that i had seen.   Ok bad but any store can have a bad employee right.  so I go up to pay, a pleasant young girl asks me if I have a Michael's card?  I say sure do and hand it to her.  Oh that's not a Michaels card ours are red.  I explain that it's a gold card for people who spend more money and that as a professional artist I'm there quite a bit.  She says I've never heard of that before.  Well it's a Michaels card just read the front it says Michaels right there.  she stands looking at me so I said try scanning it I promise it will work.  She scans it and then says oh it says you have a $5  off coupon loaded on this card.  My response;  good you get a five dollar coupon for every 100 you spend.  Now she looks scared and says the dreaded words I'm not sure,  let me call the manager.  So 20 minutes go by and who shows up the lady that argued about the Susan Lenart items.  They finally agree to try it and I'm finally out the door just 40 minutes later.  And that's not even the bad part!   I went into this store to have something framed that was three weeks ago they tell me every day it will be the next day all to no avail they use every excuse imaginable custom frames take time, or custom mat colors are hard to get.   Each time I explain it's a off the shelf frame there only cutting a black mat.  they say oh that should be fast will have it tomorrow.  I wouldn't shop here again if it was all free this store is a joke just keep driving and go to the large store at Power and McKellip's it's a much larger store with competent staff and about twice the selection.   It's well worth the drive and the cost of gas I live less than two miles from the gateway store and can still drive make my purchases and drive home much faster than trying to shop at the local gateway store.  They have even  framed two other items while I'm still waiting for the Gateway store to cut a simple mat.~~#~0
This is a small location but still packed with everything I need.  They did start stalking more womens vitamins I liked without iron because they were always out when I went in.  So I thank them for that!Staff are always nice and for the most part an answer all of my questions.  They take an added effort to get to know their customers.  They always ask about my son when I go in and this keeps me coming back because I feel valued as a person not just a customer.~~#~1
Bleh.Most of us have ventured to the rock at some point in time. It has always been quite awful, but I had some hope after new ownership took over and renovated the place. It is always sad to see a place that has potential, be complete crap.Upon walking in we were greeted by a small room used as a bar area, with random bar tables along the side. And whales. And scary looking people. And a DJ...well...kinda...he was playing music from a computer..you know...like you would so at home.We ordered two beers and sat down. Why not give it a chance, right? Just when we thought that things couldn't get worse, we heard a sound. Like a squealing sound. Yes, you guess right, horrible karaoke ON A FRIDAY NIGHT!?!?! Why God, why?????We chugged our beers and left.~~#~0
From the moment I walked into the lobby the staff displayed a level of professionalism that you don't get to see everyday. Each staff member that I came into contact with gave me a handshake and said, "Welcome to our business". I don't normally enjoy going to the dentist, but this has been the complete opposite. They made me feel very comfortable and confident that I was going to be happy with my experience, and I was!  So I set up an appointment for my 9 year old son on the way out. Since then we have both been in to have work done. My son need one filling and he took it very well, then trotted off to school like nothing ever happened. I started with a deep cleaning from Bobbie Lynn Tucker , RDH.  She was very nice and personable, did a wonderful job cleaning my teeth, not to mention gentle. I was never in any pain either during or after the procedure.  My following visit was with Dr. Brittian, DDS.  I needed a few fillings and I am very pleased with his work. Again gentle and quick.  My teeth look beautiful and feel wonderful. They were great with explaining all the costs and have cool perks like a Rewards Program.  I also liked the glass back wall that gives the patient a private calm view of the outdoors. The flat screens are cool too, but my only complaint is that when I asked quite seriously if they could change the channel, ( I dislike sport shows a lot) they were not going to budge. That might be something they want to work out. Other than that I really would recommend  them to everyone.~~#~1
I've been to this Pita Jungle a few times, about 3-4 and ordered carry-out once. Every single time my experience was great. Great service, great food, and great atmosphere. I've ate at the patio once during a rare cold winter night, and the waiter, without us even asking, put a heater right next to us. It was really nice and kept us warm while we ate our food. At times it gets busy, but the wait has never been too long and annoying. This place is great, and compared to other Pita Jungle's I've been to (the one on Shea, Tempe, and Downtown Phoenix) this Pita Jungle has to be the best. The ambiance is nice, and the decor is very welcoming. A big open room for the dinning space works well.~~#~1
Picazzo's is a freaking miracle for gluten "allergies"!  Almost everything there is gluten free, and you can get something besides gluten free pizza.  I highly recommend going during happy hour and just eating the starters - meatball sliders are awesome!Pizza is very good as well.  More reasonably priced than a lot of the chain places that get their (really friggin' expensive) dough from somewhere else.  People with celiacs:  rejoice.  Picazzo's is legendary.~~#~1
Yes, she did go to another...it's a hobby what can I say.By far, this is the LARGEST club I've been in! But my list of places to visit is still very long, so there may be bigger. I liked it here, the girls and managers, and this is important to me, were chill and nice. Some variation in looks for the girls but not much, but then again, maybe there is more to select from at night. I'm a day club visitor, because I hate to pay cover and other unnecessary costs. This place has a nice size bar, and a freaking huge main stage, with three, yes count them, three two-story tall poles (And some of the girls climb all the way to the top!). And it doesn't end there, there was a more private but large room toward the back with another stage and tall pole. There's an upstairs to this place too! I like to wander, I have a curious sense of adventure. I found multiple smaller private rooms up there, along with small mirrored rooms with single chairs. You know for that kind of one-on-one that no ones all up in your business about kind of room, just you and the dancer...Then there is the balcony that wraps around the upper floor, plenty of seating, with DJ in the center, spinning whatever the ladies on stage ask for (this is rare, some DJ's will tell you to take a flying leap if you demand a song, so I've been told...). This place is lit well too, not enough to make you run out screaming of blindness, but good enough to see. May I add that this is the first time I didn't have to go through a dressing room full of half-naked women to get to the restroom, it was separate and had more than one toilet in it, yes, amazing I know! I've been won over, lets see the other places on my list top this!~~#~1
Absolutely adorable!This place made our 5 (yep you heard it here...5) hour wait much more enjoyable.  I think it we had to sit in the same building as the pizzas were being made and had to smell the delicious aroma of others pizzas for 5 hours, I may have gone nuts.  Bar Bianco was relaxed and had everything anyone could ask for while waiting for your meal.  We loved the Arizona wine and enjoyed a tasty plate of cheese and meat while lounging in the cozy chairs in the corner.  Not only is this bar a great 'waiting room' before Pizzeria Bianco, but I would consider coming here just to relax and have a drink.Cheers!~~#~1
I think I may be addicted to this place. This location is a  bit out of my way, but after a terrible experience at the Superstition Springs Buffalo Wild Wings this became my go-to place. All of the servers are incredibly nice and efficient, and my order always comes exactly as I ordered. I've been here twice during the 2011 Stanley Cup finals and was happy that they had the sound on loud enough in the bar, but not too loud that you had to shout to the other people at the table. The food is consistently perfect, the atmosphere is great, and all of the employees I have encountered are friendly. The drink specials aren't too bad either. You can't go wrong!~~#~1
AZ 88 is a great date location.  The atmosphere is excellent - always an artistic display, usually great music.  If my parents ever make it out here from Wisconsin, I'm definitely taking them to AZ 88.  The view of the Scottsdale mall is really cool, and the proximity to a number of the "old" Old Town bars is really convenient.  The food is reasonably priced, with most sandwiches and dishes right around $10.  They have a good sized bar selection, with some really interesting imported beers.  I would absolutely recommend the AZ 88 sandwich if you enjoy buffalo sauce, and it's really hard for me to not order the little crackers with onions and bacon on them (even despite disliking bacon!).~~#~1
The best Chinese food I have had since leavong Chinatown in California.  The crab puffs had crab, not Krab and were much more crab than puff.  The food was cooked perfectly and delicious.  I strongly recommend the Mu Shu Pork!!~~#~1
Four Peaks baby.  This spot is awesome.  Great place to meet up with a crowd, grub, and pound some craft brew.  The food is great: dope appetizers , rockin' burgers, decent pizza, and daily specials.  The beer is fantastic, hop knot being my fave.  They have happy hour everday from 3-7 and 10-close with dollar off beers, a light night menu, TV's, and a pool table.  I've gotten mashed here more than a few times.  Sunday brunch is killer, and may I suggest you try the Stout milkshake, a little known secret, but good for the sweet toof.  Don't miss out on the Peaks.~~#~1
My boyfriend and I decided to try Boulders out last night because we wanted some good beer and it's within walking distance of my condo. Good choice on our behalf! We arrived around 10:30 pm, so we took advantage of reverse happy hour ($1 off most pints on draft). They were also having half price pizza night, but we had already eaten pizza earlier in the evening, so we did not get a chance to try the pizza. Had we been hungry, it seemed like a great deal.I was VERY impressed by their beer list! They had the biggest beer selection I've seen anywhere. When I was shopping at a specialty store last week, I noticed a "Maui Brewing Co. Coconut Porter" that l was very curious to try - but I passed it up because it was $10 for a 4-pack (ouch). I asked the bartender at Boulders (Rob) if they happened to have that specific beer - and to my utter surprise they did! I was happy I was able to try it out before shelling out ten bucks to buy a four pack at the store. Two thumbs up! Speaking of Rob the bartender, he was great. Very fast to take care of all the customers around us as well as my boyfriend and I. Made sure we had everything we needed without being intrusive. Overall, I had a really good first experience at Boulders on Broadway, and I will definitely be back. I dug the old-school ambiance with the wood paneled bar, we received very good service, and the selection of beer was amazing - truly something for everyone. If you live in the area, I'd recommend checking it out!I plan to get some friends together and go back for one of their "team trivia nights" soon - sounds like a blast.~~#~1
awesome and delicious place! good for groups!~~#~1
I am so grateful to say I have had the famous Rocket Burger.  This place gets so much Yelp praise and for great reason.  The soda selection is off the hook every soda you grew up with and then some all in coolers in bottles the even got YooHoo.Fries are all natural cut and amazing there is just something great about fries with the skin on them they just taste better. The burger was Phenomenal I had the Santa Fe which had the amazing Rocket Sauce, bacon, and fried green chili.  It was outta this world good.  I will be a loyal customer and I am sure will post numerous updates to this review cause this place is just that good.~~#~1
It's my fav starbuck cuz it's across the street form my house. It taunts me daily. Pavlovian response make my mouth water for a white mocha nonfat no whip everytime. The people who work there remember the regulars and offer suggestions and even help you save money by working the angles to get you the combination special price.  Also a good place for people watching or picking up a little something on the way to the light rail or antiquing up 7th Ave.~~#~1
We went to this place for my birthday, wanting to try out something new. We'd never had Ethiopian food and we were very adventurous. Be warned, we had a GPS and we had a very hard time finding it, it's tucked away in a little corner!Once we found it and stepped inside, we were definitely wow'd! The waiter answered our questions about the food, and suggested that if we really want the Ethiopian experience, to try out the Strictly Vegan combo. We ordered Tikil Gomen, Misir Watt, Kik Misir Watt, Gomen Watt, Shuro Watt, and the Dubba. We fell in love with the Shuro and the Misir Watt. The Shuro is chickpeas in a cinnamon/spicy sauce, and the Misir is spiced lentils. Soooo tasty! Even non-vegetarians will enjoy this place, and they do have meat dishes.~~#~1
Had to eat here with coworkers for lunch today and was incredibly disappointed. My $8 caesar salad was probably the tiniest I've ever had. Service was slow, the entire table was nearly finished before mine arrived, and staff was unapologetic. I've had side salads larger than the full salad they served me for lunch. Overall a miserable experience and I won't be back.~~#~0
In short - Jen rocks!Finding someone I trust to watch my crazy crew is always a bit nerve-wracking.  I came across Jen's Pet Sitting while searching for options, since I'm relatively new to the area.  I decided to book a consultation with Jen to have her meet the furry family and learn more about her and her services.  Jen is extremely professional and came ready to take notes and also spent a lot of time getting to know my critters.  It was clear from her interactions with my cats and dogs that she loves animals and really understands them.  After having a great experience with Jen during the consult I booked her to do visits over a long weekend.  The hubs and I took our dogs along for the trip and Jen looked after our cats while we were away. She gave us regular daily updates about our cats while we were gone.  Sometimes she sent pictures with her updates which was an added bonus!  Jen spent time playing with our cats during each visit which was fabulous.I always know I've found a wonderful petsitter when I come home and my animals are a little disappointed to see me!  We will definitely continue to use Jen in the future.~~#~1
The best Vietnamese I have ever had. Very authentic menu (not even in English). Great service and knowledgeable staff. The ambiance is lackluster, but this is typical with Vietnamese food. Great for dining in quickly or taking home.~~#~1
I have been to slippery pig a half a dozen times in the last few months since moving in nearby. I have nothing but great things to say about the shop. They are friendly and courteous and I haven't experienced any of that bike snobbery that comes with LBS. I am glad I found a local shop with great service~~#~1
Awesome place.I am pretty sure that this is my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale. Honeycomb, radishes, and a huge heap of rainbow valley butter for an appetizer? what?! Whaat? I had to take a picture of it. The waitress gave me a hard time about this, but she was cool :pMy coworkers and I went on a mission to try everything here. I do remember the brussel sprouts being too salty. but everything else was great. spicy broccoli...fat-fat cooked potatoes....perfectly grilled ribeeyeeeee.. .yummm..but i dooo remember the brussel sprouts being a bit too salty for me.. but i forgave them for this. In addition to the great food, it's a cute little restaurant with a lot of character. The servers (who are also your bartenders - i thought this was a bit interesting) are really friendly. Good memories here!~~#~1
My first and only experience there was excellent. The service was exemplary - the server knew the menu, was enthusiastic about it, and assisted us in choosing our items without being pushy. The food was exceptionally prepared and tasted excellent. The tzatziki was the best I've had. Nice and thick, with cucumber and spiced well with herbs and garlic. The spanikopita was also exceptionally with fresh clean tasting spinach and delicately textured phyllo dough. The pan fried calamari reminded me of Europe, fresh tasting, delicately fried in olive oil and not in the least bit chewy. The pita bread was warm and fresh and for dessert, the baklava had a complex flavor and tasted home made. The environment was tasteful, old world European and exceptionally clean and organized. I will be back!~~#~1
I love this place.  I especially love it on Tuesdays when it's free. I have been to many lectures, openings and films at the Museum and am always fascinated.  The changing photography exhibit is always fantastic.  The fashion room is one of my favorite features.  BUT my favorite piece is the firefly installation.  I could seriously live in that room. I take everyone I know and everyone is always as mesmerized as I am, and I have seen it many times.I love the new contemporary wing of the museum.  I also love the glass boxes on the sides of the building.  One time we were there during a thunderstorm and sat in the glass box and watched the lightening.  It was perfect!  The museum always makes me happy.~~#~1
Slowest DRIVE THRU ever!!!! Also the quintessential SHORT BUS Location.I frequented this location around dinner time since it is the closest to my home a few times and every time it is between a 10-15 min ordeal. When i worked at Mickey D's in the early 90's we had what was called 90 sec HBO( Hand Bag Out), from order to picking up should be no longer than 90 secs. This must not be a practiced any longer.  I have to say hello when I drive up to the speaker due to getting no response. Then I get someone who is rude and say's yes. I order the big mac deal, buy 1, get 1 for a $1. The employee says they do not offer that, I advise their menu out front does. After 5 min of silence and cars backing up I pull fwd to make sure he is still living to see what is up. Total lack of cust serv service, he had to have the mgr show him how to ring it up, no apology or anything. This happened each time I went there. C'mon man~~#~0
DD has great food, friendly staff, and a wonderful patio. The breakfast menu is the best in downtown Scottsdale. DD is also great for lunch and early evening. The Happy Hour menu is a great value. I have been there many times and the food and service is consistently top rate.~~#~1
The Farm at South Mountain is a splendid little slice of the country- right here in the middle of the desert!The plentiful green grass spotted with picnic tables makes me want to plan a family reunion. There are gardens and walkways to explore. From first glance, The Farm is a quaint, family-run farmhouse.Visit Morning Glory Cafe for breakfast and you won't be disappointed. I've personally enjoyed the Morning Glory Benedict on several occasions, while my brother is a big fan of the Farm Monte Cristo. Both dishes are made with as many local ingredients as possible... mmm... local-icious. The Farm Monte Cristo is about as close as any breakfast food gets to "groin-grabbingly delicious." (a la Homer Simpson) It's slow baked ham, over easy eggs, and melted cheese between two generous pieces of French Toast. Served with warm maple syrup, this is it, folks. The grand-daddy of breakfast foods. The service here is generally solid. Our servers tend to be interesting, friendly, and adorable- all good qualities to have when you're serving breakfast to someone who isn't happy about being up early.I'll return... and return... and return. I'm hooked.I only wish Morning Glory wasn't closed for the summer! Killing me.~~#~1

Been going to Don and Charlie's for years now.  It's kind of a family tradition.  A sports hangout, you may see some players and coaches during the off season as Scottsdale is a big place for spring training.  (This delighted my single girlfriends who took every opportunity to flirt the entire time I visited with them).The bar is roomy and comfortable, with more than ample stools to accommodate my generous tush. Say hello to Shelley who is mi favorito bartender!  You are welcome to dine at the bar, but the dining room is much more comfortable, with a great deal of banquette seating-  which I adore.  I often have the veal chop, or a nice, big NY Strip.  Twice baked potatoes, creamed spinach......you know the routine in the "good old boys' steakhouse."  The best part is the house made chopped chicken livers which are simply to die for.Valet service rounds out the numerous reasons to choose this place over others in the area.  I almost forgot the comprehensive wine list, including wines by the glass.A must stop when you are in Scottsdale!~~#~1
I was Frost bitten when the first location opened in Tucson. Since 2008, I have tried numerous gelato places and none have come close to the creaminess, tastiness and overall authentic fare as Frost. Each dip of the spoon is reminiscent of my travels abroad in Italy with memories that bring a smile to my face and pleasure to my tongue. The San Tan village location is 25 minutes away but the drive is worthwhile. The staff is friendly, helpful and armed with spoons for you to sample any flavor you wish. I went with the dark chocolate and salted caramel. Truly delightful! Word on the street is there are 3 locations to pop up around the Phoenix area. I think Tempe would be a great choice! Hint hint....~~#~1
Beware... use only a credit card so you can stop payment if you need to. ( our sales person encouraged us to pay cash and get a 10% discount ).  Big mistake,  Any problem you're on your own...really... On your own!  We've spent over $3,000 at this store and it has been a nightmare.  Delivery took  weeks longer then our sales person said & our paper work indicated. There was a mistake with the fabric, the paint was mismatched, what was to take 10 days took 3 months.  Not a darn thing was handled properly.  Every call we made to "customer service" was routed directly  back to our  sales person. We went back to the store  in person but there is no mgr, no one except commission sales staff and a voice mail merry go round.~~#~0
Don't usually give 5 stars, but this is good sushi. At first, I was a little skeptic of all the macadamia nuts on their sushi, but it is a great compliment.The rolls are original and all very good. The Climax('s) and the Elliot are my favorite.~~#~1
Great activity for kids. It's clean, spacious and safe.~~#~1
Received two more messages from "Iolanda" this morning.  Thought some of you might get a kick out of reading them.  I'm definitely never going back to 98 South.  Hope this info helps some of you...  BTW, don't you just love orangeheads??  Doling out insults are so much easier when hiding behind a mask!19 minutes ago: Obviously rebuttal is not your friend but jealously is your neighbor......9 minutes ago: Thought the drink was for your gentleman friend but your the one that had to abandoned it.....You really shouldn't have your picture posted ......pug!!! I mean easy target....Lets go west side .............yeppie!!!~~#~0
Wow what a fun little antique,etc. store I stumbled across the other day!  I stopped in at the Starbucks for a refresher and noticed all of this funky stuff out in front of the store!  I went inside and it was a combination of an 19th century hardware store and art walk.  There was just a little bit of everything-some vintage, shabby chic, crystal door pulls - industrial - toys. The owners are great and are going to help me find a little period table I've been searching for. Lot of great accents!  I'm hooked!  I'll be back with a vengence!~~#~1
AMAZING. Everything we had was the best we have eaten; sushi, crab cakes, oysters!  It's a MUST if near the Scottsdale Quarter!  We chose to eat there 2 nights in a row, once for a reserved dinner and the other for the happy hour.~~#~1
This was the perfect lunch! I got the Sack's Symphony with turkey, bacon, avocado, sprouts, tomato and cream cheese. It was SO SO good. The combination was prefect. There was plenty of meat and toppings piled on- it definitely filled me up. It's clear the place is a well-loved lunch spot- it was a full house at 1:00. I can't wait to go back.~~#~1
Great shopping place for clothes, jewelry, art and home decor! One of those GREAT finds and the owners are really nice. It has boutique clothing at affordable prices, great atmosphere and FRIENDLY!!!!~~#~1
Totally excited to try this place out, my grandparents, my mom and I (4 of us) came here for some Korean food. It wasn't too busy; just pairs of people from nearby offices coming in and out. Unlike other Korean restaurants, their lunch special selection is very limited. Special A  consists of a sushi roll with a soda, special B = teriyaki beef/chicken (no soda), or special C, Korean BBQ Spicy Chicken. As we were looking at the "lunch special" board, the lady behind the counter insisted that we should look at their full price menu instead. Here comes the awkward part: she then asked my mom "are you Chinese?" Even though she is, my mum looked at me all puzzled as in "what does that mean?" The lady proceeded by pointing at the "seafood pancake" section on the menu and saying "I don't know why but you Chinese like this pancake a lot." Good thing my mom didn't hear what she said.. or else... So we got the Spicy Chicken lunch special ($6.99), a bulgogi ($6.99), and a beef yakisoba ($7.19). The cool thing about this place is that it has a mini "kimchi" buffet bar, with trays of marinated tofu, potato, bean sprout, kimchi, broccoli and some other vegetables. It also has this delicious house special hot sauce. By the time we finished a dish of kimchi, the food came, so it didn't take long. The spicy chicken, came in a bowl about the size of an instant-noodle bowl (but slightly deeper), was tender, with rice underneath it. The chicken was definitely marinated well; however, the last couple of pieces had tendons and big chunks of fat... what a bad way to end it. The bulgogi also came in a bowl, with rice underneath. The beef was definitely not marinated fully. The color was super light and the beef was close to tasteless. The biggest disappointment, food-wise, was the beef yakisoba. The noodles, occupying most of the Styrofoam lunch box, were sweet. Then there was an ice-cream scoop of rice, topped with 3 pieces, I kid you not, THREE pieces of dog-tag-sized, super-dry meat. In the end, we just decided to bring the barely-touched yakisoba home for my younger brother (well, teenage boys tend to eat everything...). While my mom transfered the noodles to the plastic bowl (since the Styrofoam box was lidless), I went to ask for a plastic cover. This is the best part: the same lady, stared at me, pointed at the salad bar and said "you can't take that home". I thought there was a miscommunication, so I asked again for a lid for the noodles. Again, she pointed at the salad bar and said "you are not allowed to take the kimchi home". Wow seriously? Just b/c my grandparents are Chinese you assumed we were stashing kimchi in a bowl and trying to sneak it out? "Look, I just want to take my noodles home, ok?" She hesitantly gave me a lid."Hey, hey you. we chineness peple no steal kimchi becuz Confucius say 'no stealing kimchi'"... only if I said that to her face...Oh, and when we got home, my brother, aka our food dumpster, took a bite of the yakisoba and never touched it again.  Conclusion: If you want amazing Korean food and friendly customer service, please just go to Chodang. Chodang is WAYYY BETTER, hands down~~#~0
3 months, 22 emails, 10 plus calls and (I think) we have the final refund from Budget! Stay clear of Budget Rental they DO NOT care about customers or resolving their monumental mistakes!~~#~0
I been here once and I loved it!!  Food here is amazing! Decor is cute, felt like walking into someones home!  It's communal seating so get to know other guest!  Service was great, but before I continue....They're closing this weekend due to the lack of business!  OMG!  I recommend going before you miss out - take care Lola - what ever you want - you get :)~~#~1
I am totally addicted to this place. Tons of flavors of smoothies, and perfectly cooked Boba. Green Tea, or even Vanilla Chi - so far all the flavors I've tried have been fantastic.~~#~1
Words cannot express how much I love the meat shop. I love it like a fat guy loves the place that sells him the best bacon he has ever had... because I am and it is.I'll be honest, it can be a bit intimidating walking in to the Meat Shop for the first time, if you aren't a chef and don't know your cuts, you may be afraid, but don't fear just ask for help because the staff are excellent!Whether beef, pork or lamb, the meat here is always the best quality, and knowing its locally raised and by people who care about what they are doing makes it even better. And price? I've never compared closely but I don't really think twice about the price here!Be warned! If you buy meat here, you will be ruined! You will never again be able to purchase that saltwater packed, antibiotic injected, hormonally treated, ammonia and pink good filled crap in your supermarket again!And that is a very, very good thing.~~#~1
I LOL just thinking about some of the cast members and skits that I have seen at Jesterz. The first time I saw Jesterz, I was expecting it to be pretty awkward and honeslty didn't know what to expect. I was blown away how funny it got at times. Good clean funny. We went again soon after the first time but didn't go again for a good 2 years, we went back recently and was kinda worried as the crowd was not as big as past times. Even with a smaller crowd there were tons of LOL moments. Writing about it kinda makes me want to go back.~~#~1
What a great place to hike/ run/ shred! It's a great hike to shake up the routine with.  A steep hike with bits of scrambling to a summit with amazing views. The only downside is there's mad crowds of people snaking their way up and down the hill. I feel for humanity sake I must pass on some words of advice. 1) If you need to pass- Just say "Excuse Me" or "On your left/right" or, if those don't work, "Can I pass?" Don't frustrate yourself and huff and puff behind someone because they can't interpret your grunts. 2) The railing sections. Yes, it's steep but if you see someone running down using the railing and trying to go fast- LET GO and let them pass. There's this thing called gravity and it will keep you firmly on this earth. Trust me you're not going to fly off into space nor topple over backwards. Then you can grab the railing and pull yourself up if that's what you need to do. 3) I can't believe I have to mention this- DON'T FREAKIN' SMOKE on the trail. Apparently there are some who can't savor life's moments without puffing on a cigarette. But if I see you smoking as I hike this thing I will be forced to kick you in the shins. I can't help it it's what happens when I inhale second hand smoke. 4) Your trash does not add to the ambiance. Pack out what you take in. This includes dog owners. Pick it up. Nothing will decompose because this is a desert. Just sayin' 5) Finally, sometimes in life when we arrive to our destination and find the parking lot full one must consider finding other options. Yeah, you in the SUV waiting with the engine running for a spot at the nearest stall to the trail head. Park down the road and walk up. Ridiculous. Happy Hiking!~~#~1
The BEST Japanese food in AZ! Guaranteed! When you are looking for original Japanese food, or the closest taste to Japan, this would be it! The sushi is soooo fresh and they always carry out items that are not available in other sushi place like uni or sweet little octopus that I love! Their ramen is also superb and if you come here for lunch, don't forget to check in their special of the day cause they offer a great price with superb taste and lots of variety for lunch!! Love this place so much!~~#~1
I'm a sucker for a yummy coconut cupcake and Tammie Coe has the best around as far as I've tasted, and I've eaten a lot of bad coconut cupcakes -- all in the name of research of course.  Keep 'em coming, Tammie!~~#~1
Great pizza and awesome must have guacamole pizza appitizer!!!!~~#~1
This place was horrible! I will never go back it was over priced and the best thing I ate was the corn bread you get  before the meal.  I had the chorizo stuffed tenderlion it was like chewing on a piece of rubber stuffed with soy. My girl freind had  flavorless tacos with stale corn tortillas. three  words it sucked, sucked, sucked!~~#~0
Just fantastic. I first went to Cornish Pasty in 05' a few months after they opened and fell in love immediately. Although a few things have changed over the years each one is usually an improvement and never a negative. If you are not familiar, a pasty is a traditional British coal miners food.  A hearty filling wrapped in a pie crust and baked. Kind of a hand-held meat pie. Cornish Pasty Co. has taken this simple and traditional dish and meticulously perfected each component. Their crusts are some how simultaneously hearty and flaky. Although their is nothing delicate about their seasoning it is never out of balance and all of the ingredients are always quality. Beyond just mastering the finer details of pasty science, Cornish Pasty Co. has also branched off into wild and exotic flavors. It's no shocker that the British know Indian food and it shows with the tika masala and the lamb vindaloo pasties. What is shocking is the refinement of the Greek and Italian inspired pasties. Perhaps my favorite pasty, from the cuisine most elusive to the British, is the Carne Avadado. This is a Mexican inspired pasty that will satisfy even the most snobby Las Cruses/El Paso foodie. If you have ever talked Mexican food with one you will know just what I mean. I have eaten nearly every item on the menu and not a one disappoints. It took me ages to get past the pasties and start ordering soups and salads. Now that I have had the spinach, mushroom, walnut soup, it is hart to save room for my old favorites. Although the mine shaft inspired interior is dark and cramped I have never felt uncomfortable there. The sound system is usually bumping classic rock and the employees are pierced and tattooed well beyond your typical wait staff, but everyone is friendly and service is typically good.If I have to list a negative the only one I can think of is the food is consistently just a little better at the University location than the Dobson one.  No clue why, but everyone I've talk to seems to agree, the Tempe store has the edge on quality.  After you add a respectable selection of beers the only reason you won't be here every night is your waist line.~~#~1
The castle is what drew us here.  It's just the front of a castle with a reading nook in the bottom of the tower.  The 3 year old was impressed as soon as he saw it.  There is also a play area with big activity walls.  It was a little hard for my son to comprehend being quiet while playing.  Getting to the library was confusing with the GPS.  Just follow the signs and park in the garage at the end to the left when you pull in.  Well worth a one time visit.~~#~1
This place is over priced and the service is horrible. I went there with my feiends and the server was very rude and degrading!~~#~0
Dave at Dave's Ashtanga is the best yoga teacher. He is kind, considerate, patient and a very nice person. He will take the time to show you a yoga move or asana. He is very knowledgeable about different subjects. What I like best is once he said, "here you can do nothing wrong."~~#~1
Just a quick update.... Took my parents here for lunch today, and now I have 2 more converts! If anyone is still sleeping on this place, shame on you; you're really missing out. Why? DELICIOUS food made from QUALITY ingredients and FRESHLY prepared hot to order. Good stuff all around!~~#~1
I love this place!!!!fun poker 3 days a week!!great food!!!great prices!!!even better people!!!!~~#~1
Fuego Bistro is one of my new favorites! A couple people have recommended it to me, so my boyfriend and I decided to try it for restaurant week. We arrived about 15 minutes before our reservation to have a drink on the patio. The staff was super welcoming and friendly. Matt enjoyed a mai tai and I had a red sangria - both very refreshing. Our table was ready right on time and we had an awesome waitress who gave great suggestions on ordering... there were so many good looking options on their restaurant week menu. We're sharers, so we ordered with that in mind. Drinks: We got the pomegranate mojito (very refreshing) and a peach-blood orange mojito (sweet, but very good)Starters: Signature empanadas: Tasty. The focus was the meat, I would have preferred more vegetables inside.Sauteed prawns: The star here were the sauces - delicious!Entrees: Cola Braised Short Ribs: AMAZING! Some of the best we've ever had. The short ribs were very tender and not fatty at all. The flavor was so good!Pernil Asado (shredded pork): So delicious!! I made little tacos with their fresh corn tortillas. Sides: Green chili cornbread casserole: A little drier than I had imagined, but great flavor. Maple chiliglazed carrots: The glaze didn't really stand out to me, but good as far as baby carrots go.Jalapeno creamed corn: I was pleasantly surprised - really enjoyed this one! Chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes: A great side with the short rib. Dessert: (By this point, we knew we'd need to be rolled out of the restaurant, but we HAD to have dessert since it was part of restaurant week). Chocolate chip bread pudding: Really good chocolate chip bread with scoops of malted chocolate crisp ice cream. This was a lot of food after that meal, but I savored the bites I had. The ice cream was excellent!Banana burrito: exactly what you'd picture with scoops of the same icecream - delicious! I can't wait to go back to Fuego and tell my friends about it. Great service, charming atmosphere, and excellent dishes.... Fuego is a winner!~~#~1
Never thought I'd review a supermarket, but since it's tough times for alot of people out there, I'd like to share my 2 cents..First of all, you don't need a card.  The deals are for everyone and it makes it hassle-free during checkout.  Now, about the deals ~ I find that Albertsons has the lowest prices and best deals and you can find them amonst any product you're looking for.  It's WAY cheaper than Safeway for sure.This is what i found yesterday:  88 cents for 2 (yes two!) snicker bars or other comparable chocolate bars, $1 for a bag of lifesavor hard candies, and $14.99 for a 24 bottle case of coors light.  They also had 69 cent bags of frozen veggies that people were buying like crazy.  Also, this location has really good cuts of meat.  I'm Korean and was so excited that they had short ribs cut perfectly for Kalbi jjim (korean braised shortribs), and for $3.99 a pound, it was quite a deal!~~#~1
Stopped back in here today for lunch with Arlin B., Robyn N. & Mike C.  They're still delivering the same upscale Asian Buffet experience here as before, including atmosphere, food & table service that are just tops so it's "Woohoo" again for this excellent restaurant!!     :-))(See previous review for more details.  Weekday Lunch Buffet is still $11.99/$10.79 Sr.)~~#~1
My daughter loves this place, unfortunately they ran out of money and are closing currently.~~#~1
DON'T GET TIFFANY UNLESS YOU WANT A SPEEDY EXPERIENCEPretty Nail tale with Tiffany-My 10 year old first mani/pedi4:35 water and feet in chair only 13 minutes and painting toes. Prepped and painted fingernails from the chair- in 20 minutes. 35 minutes in all. Told owner I was unhappy and she said that a kid mani/pedii was 35 minutes then later 35 to 45 minutes. Tiffany never let it dry between coats so when she sat her under the light she told her only 5 more minutes and I stopped her. She said only the under coats will be wet and the top will be dry. I told her Really because you never even let it dry between coats.  She said not 4 coat. Base 2 color and top is 4 ... well top and base dry fast she said...Owner said" fast or slow it doesn't matter as long as the polish looks good and it looks good." I didn't tip her on purpose...not because I'm poor- I got poor service. I would expect this for a color change but not a spa pedicure/manicure.  Very disappointed.  You'd think the owners would realize that all the other patrons saw her take advantage of us.  Get anyone but Tiffany unless you want a quick job!~~#~0
I had a great burger experience here and intend to return the next time I am craving a Fuddburger. I also got to introduce a friend to Fuddrucker's for the first time, so it was a cherry-poppin' adventure. Not only are the burgers here tasty, but I love the fact that you get to pick and choose the toppings from their self-serve produce and condiment bars. One of my favorite things on french fries is Heinz 57 sauce and Fuddrucker's is truly awesome for including that amongst its vast condiment selection.As a professed condiment whore, I was thrilled to discover a new flavor of Tabasco I have never encountered before... and I like to think I really know my Tabasco products, having lived in Louisiana for years. This Fuddruckers special-orders the Sweet & Spicy variety of Tabasco which is not only great on a burger, but would work as an egg-roll dipping sauce. Knowing that I must have it for home use, my dining partner graciously approached the manager who arranged to allow him to purchase a bottle. This was just one example of how efficient, helpful, and friendly the staff here are. Next visit, I will demand to meet the one who refers to himself only as "Mr. Crusty Baker" (see photos).The restaurant also has a lot of shiny fun decor evoking shameless Americana and Route 66 roadside culture. The bright colors and the overindulgence in fast food goodness contributes to a heightened state of arousal that can only be described as a "Burger Party Contact High". You can just feel the burger love... the afterglow punctuated by the difficult click of the seat belt as you strap in for a ride back to a somber, less-gluttonous reality.~~#~1
True fine dining has come to the Valley.If you are looking to have a special dinner, this is the place.  And plan on spending 3 hours as it is a true culinary experience.The tasting menu consists of options of 4, 5, or 6 courses, and they can be paired with wine, if you like.  This is the way to go and even for tasting portions, they are not micro-mini.The choices for each course are extensive.  At least 6-10 each.  AND, the coolest part, is that you won't find any ingredient repeated twice.  NONE.  Yes you might find tomatoes in the same night, but they won't be the same type.  That's not easy to pull off, considering the variety of the menu.But, while you are between courses, Chef Binkley will send out numerous amuse bouche - which, if you don't know, are tiny little one bit or one gulp appetizers like, mini sliders the size of a half dollar, or pancetta mousse in a shot glass.We ate there for my ex-H's bday, and had 8 amuse bouche.  Also, if you let them know in advance you are there for a special occasion, you will get custom printed menus for everyone at the table mentioning the special event.The ONLY drawback, is the atmosphere.  It definitely doesn't fit the quality and beauty of the food.  But, I still give it a 5, as the food is superb.If you are a true foodie GO. I was excited the whole meal, as I couldn't wait to see what came out next!   If you are a meat and potatoes type with an uneducated palate, save your time and money, since you won't appreciate the menu at all.~~#~1
I've been coming here for several years.  Can't find my first review.  I guess it was too long ago.  So here comes another one.The woman who runs the place.  I've forgotten her name.  She is one of the most gracious, friendly, and kind people you can ever hope to meet.When I go there, sometimes with and some times without my wife, I alway order the small sausage sandwich.  With ajvar and onion, this can't be beat no matter how you my search around.  The sausages, cevap, are delicious and what's unusual is that the bread is almost as good as the sausages.  Simply delicious from all points of view.  They make their own sausages and their own bread from scratch.  In fact they make everything from scratch right there in the restaurant.  Their soups are do die for.A very favorite of ours.I give this a 5 star because in the Bosnian/Jugoslavian cuisine catagory, this can't be beaten.One more thing worth mentioning:  her Baklava is top of the mark.  It's not as sweet as what you find in other restaurants.  Everything is simply top shelf.~~#~1
Try the Chicken Parmesan!  It's the best I've ever had? Quite possibly. When I worked in that area we would hit it for lunch once a week. Donna is awesome in a take-no-shit-but-still-take-care-of-you kind of way. She calls it as she sees it and I think that's great. By your third visit she will most likely know what you are gunna order.I can't comment on the rest of the menu as I've only ordered the Chicken Parm. Yeah, it's that good.~~#~1
I parked in the Parking Garage, got my parking ticket validated, and still owed money for parking.  The parking validation was worth $3.00.  The charge for parking was $5.00 with $2.00 credit for the validation (not the $3.00 I was promised).  I paid the remaining $3.00 charge, but then, the machine wouldn't give me a receipt.I am never going back to this location.  It is off my radar from now on.~~#~0
Impossibly good Italian deli in the middle of the desert. Huge sandwiches on the most incredible bread you've ever had outside of NY. As someone who ate here 3 times in a 24 hr period, I feel especially compelled to tell you about their cheesesteak. HO-LY-SHIT. Easily the most decadent, flavorful cheesesteak I've had in a VERY long time - and I live 15 minutes outside of Philly. Im still in disbelief that they could pull something like that off. Ask for yours on the soft roll.I should also mention the sausage,  peppers & onion sandwich, which was really good. I suspect they make their own sausage, which elevates them to superstar status in my book. The chicken parm sandwich and dinner are both equally good, and the meatball sandwich deserves honorable mention as well.I dont do cold subs, but the ones I saw coming out of the kitchen looked huge and tasty. Perhaps I will try their pizza next time I'm in town.~~#~1
This was my first experience with Lush (with many more to follow).  I stumbled into the store because I could smell it 4 stores down, and I was drawn in by the aroma (I don't even thing I read the name on the sign...I just followed my nose).  I had never seen anything like it!  The giant blocks of soap, the colorful bath-bombs, the bubble bars (that looked like little cakes), and so much more!  It was late December, so the sales staff told me that any left-over Christmas items were buy 1 get 2 free (what a deal on my first visit!).  They demonstrated a bath bomb for me, and I was MESMERIZED!  I got 6 Christmas bath bombs (4 of them for free!) and 3 travel-sized Snow Fairy shower gels (another Christmas product, and by far one of my favorite Lush products EVER).  I also got some non-holiday bath bombs and melts because they were just too heavenly to pass up (I got a Youki Hi bath bomb, my favorite bath bomb ever, which was sadly discontinued sometime last year).  I also got my first piece of Lush soap (Sexy Peel. all the citrus just makes me smile when I use this soap. It's sunshine in your shower)Since I used to work in the mall I would go into Lush whenever I had a break and get a couple things, and the staff always recognized me :) They even offered me a hand-cream sample one day when I was complaining of dry hands.  I brought some of my friends from school in and told the girl behind the counter that they were newbies, so she rushed out from behind the counter to demonstrate EVERYTHING in the store!  Literally, she showed us bath bombs, bubble bars, face cleansers and toners, massage bars, and dusting powders.  I was so impressed by her powder demo that I bought some Candy Fluff dusting powder (another item that has since been discontinued.  Vanilla Puff powder is a nice substitute).This store holds a special place in my heart because it was the first Lush store I ever went to, and I will forever have fond memories of the staff that dazzled me, and every time I smell Sexy Peel Soap or SnowFairy Shower Gel I am reminded of that magical day :)~~#~1
$8 for a tiny sandwich with one egg, two greasy strips of bacon, and a stale muffin. They say it's pricy because they get it local? It has to have substance to be considered anything. So whack.~~#~0
I heard good things about this place, and was looking forward to what the "basement" atmosphere would feel like, lowbrow, a little seedy, etc. Sadly, too many middle-aged men wearing flip flops out on a Friday night. Flip flops? UGH..in Winter? Also, our waiter SUCKED! He acted like he had a hard night and was unwilling to suggest a beer, so I am sure he spit in my draft...Anyhoo, does not matter as I will not return.~~#~0
Place is alright but for the waitress, poor service and things sent over we didn't order.  We sent them back but had  additional items brought and not brought on the tab anyway.  She said me "that couldn't happen" and refused to take it off. Waitress included autograt. I have been here a dozen times and never get great service but enjoy myself.  This time will be my last.~~#~0
Yen has amazing sushi. I would say that they have the best sushi in AZ. You have to try it to see how amazing it is. The service is great and I feel like I just stepped into Japan. The whole sushi experience is very authentic and perfect place to hang out with friends or take a date :DThere is only one thing I don't like. Sometimes it get's to busy so make sure to get there early (around 7 P.M) if you want to be seated right away.~~#~1
The staff is friendly. But the physical hotel itself itself is comparable to a 2 star motel. The Holiday Express I stayed at is better than this. Priceline tricked me when I requested for a 4 star and indicated that this was a 4 star in name your own price.Cons:1) They have cactus in the parking lot where when I got home late, it was dark, poorly lit lot, and opened my car door, step out of the car, and step on to cactus severely injuring my foot to where I can not walk anymore. Who puts low cactus in a dimly lit parking lot where when you get out of a car, someone can step on it? Being injured on vacation is no fun and very painful!2) hotel room and property is old, like from the 1980s though the front desk boy told me that the rooms were newly renovated3) Given the previous reviews I asked for a quiet room, but was given a room where the squeeking and thumping and wall shaking, woke me up at 5 in the morning. The neighbors flushing the toilet, showering, and running water can all be heard.4) the bathroom door is so jammed that it requires both hands, all of my body wait and a few minutes of wrestling with it to open/close it5) Requested a single bed, however upon arrival, was told that it would be 30/extra a night for a single bed instead of 2 doubles6) 80s style tube TV 7) pink 80s decor8) worn down bed with body dent in it9) wifi costs 9.99/for 24 hours even though its signal is only 1 bar10) AC blasts loudly on and off during the night11) curtains are cut half way so tons of light comes in to the room in the morning. pros: 1) location2) staff smiles and says hi3) cleaning staff does a good job~~#~0
Lives up to the local fuss. Quick, cheap, tasty and one of the few fast Mexican food restaurants that utilize yellow cheese, which is my cardinal rule of good Mexican food.~~#~1
I've stayed at several hotels in the Hyatt Place chain and they are all great, but this one in particular stands out as having the friendliest, most helpful staff.~~#~1
I haven't yelped in about 2 months, and I was waiting for a place to either wow me or disgust me.  Well, this place was that bad. First impressions were all right -- the outside bar was neat w/ good views of downtown, and the fire pits were nice.  No beers on tap though; and seriously, what's with the hip-hop club DJ at 7:00 pm?  Come on guys, way too early for that.It wasn't too long before three of us were seated; and after about 10 minutes, our waitress came up and asked us whether we were ready to ... oh wait, that's right, no menus yet, good job.  O.k., so I ordered the Thai Spring rolls, which had a filling of lettuce, a single strip of carrot, and noodles.  Seriously?!  Main course, I ordered the curry, which turned out to be the worst curry in the world -- I don't even know if it was curry; it was more like a bowl of thick, yellow soup, with a few pieces of chicken and a couple of vegetables tossed in.  Yuck.  And then they only gave me a tiny bowl of rice.  I'm sorry, isn't it supposed to be the other way around?  My friends completely agreed with how bad the place was (I think they had some sort of stir fry, which they said was bland and pointless).So yeah, I don't recommend this place.  Instead, head a block over to The Roosevelt for some good beer on tap and some pretty good food.~~#~0
Being a very experienced pho eater, I must say that the pho at the BlueMoon is excellent!  That, plus the pho is 50% off, so that must have added to my utility.  Veggies were fresh and the service friendly.  Oh, and the appetizer came out only a minute after ordering.  Meal was hot and came out just as we finished the appetizer.Spent a total of $13.61 (including tax) for (2) large bowls of pho, a Thai ice tea and a order of fresh spring rolls.  Our bellies were stuffed and wallets intact.Will eat here again!~~#~1
Love their pizza!!!Very fresh. Their cannoli was really good too.They seem to have great selection of wines.~~#~1
Beaver Choice is an excellent place which I have had the chance to visit three or four times.  This is about as home-cooked as you can get in a restaurant.  It's like eating at Mom's house, if Mom happens to be Swedish.I've had a few of the entrees -- schnitzel cordon bleu, pork medallions, seared gravlax -- and all were delicious.  Especially the gravlax.The sides are also great, and you usually get three per meal.The poutine is perhaps not as good as what you'd get in Quebec, but it's easily the best I've had in Arizona.  The fact that they even have poutine wins this place a few points.I have also had the opportunity to try their dessert specialty, the Beaver Supreme.  This mess of chocolate, meringue, cream, mandarin orange, and possibly a few other things, is the sort of thing which you set out intending to only eat half in the first sitting, but ultimately find your free will diminished, invariably resulting in an empty dish and a fear of the onset of diabetes.Also, it seems one gentleman gave this place low marks for the long preparation time on a chicken wrap.  I just have to ask, why would anyone go to a Scandinavian restaurant and order a chicken wrap?  Can you imagine what would happen if you wander into a Viking camp and order a chicken wrap?  Your head would be off before you could recite one measly Odinian incantation.~~#~1
I was not impressed. The food was bad & expensive. The wait is ridiculous. Don't go.~~#~0
This was the best camera/photography store in the valley.  It has now been re-imagined and renamed as Photomart upon its move to Scottsdale.  I recently visited the new location...and I was shocked!  The store was extremely small, had very little to sell (I didn't even see a camera on display).  They did carry some glass...but mostly a very small selection of accessories.  I didn't even recognize any of the former employees.  I encourage all the former loyal Photomark customers to visit Photomart.  I'm sure you will leave disappointed.  Two thumbs down to this lemon!~~#~0
Always a healthy, fresh meal. One of my favorites is the hummus and grilled chicken appetizer(which is gynormous) and I have them add in some tabbouleh, then cucumbers on the side. Perfection. All the pitas, and the seasonal specials are always super good. Wine is also inexpensive if the mood strikes. Otherwise, great casual lunch and dinner spot that is extremely reasonable in price for the quality of food you are getting. There is something for everyone here, veggies, kids, etc. If I ever moved from AZ, this is the first place I would come visit upon my return. Parking can get hairy at the Arcadia location, and one time someone actually backed into my car when I was legally parked along a curb but that is hardly Pita Jungle's fault. The douche didn't even leave a note - but I digress and karma is real and nothing would keep me from coming back to Pita!~~#~1
It's a good concept if the owners / mismanagement had bothered to keep a trendy or classy atmosphere. As it is save your money get fast food - McDonald's has less grease. We had to ask for plates for the appetizer platter (it is meant to be shared) so the sever handed my daughter 4 paper plates. My salad wasn't a salad it was a paper plate of mixed greens - really no tomatoes, nothing on it or in it other than lettuce and she threw a packet of Newmans Dressing on the table just like the ones you get at Burger King or McDonald's. My steak - it was OK - I asked for medium and got medium well and that was the best part of it. The steak is served on a paper plate and when I asked about utensils I was directed to go get my own from around the corner - yup plastic ware for a steak on a paper plate.My daughter had a burger and it was so greasy the bun turned soggy brown part way through then fell completely apart.Service? Well let's just pretend this place is 100% do it yourself then it would be OK. The waitress walked away before my daughter finished her order. Never came back and asked how things were, nothing. Really if we were the kind to dine & dash it wouldn't have been a problem because she wouldn't have known we were gone. My daughter actually had to go find the server and ask for the bill!!!!What kills me is the employees exude an I don't care attitude which is also obvious in their actions (or lack of actions) and the message I got was the owner / mis-management has accepted this lazy unfriendly service because it's obvious by how poorly the place is run that it's OK with them.It could be great but they would need to make a lot of changes - job 1 fire everyone & start over. If I could have given them 1/2 a star I would have - we won't be going back.~~#~0
Free samples? One dollar churros? Cheap buys? Why not.~~#~1
Let me first say that we are fans of the W Hotel and have stayed in many of their hotels around the nation and are overall happy with the accommodations and customer service.  I'm a local Phoenician who resides in the Arcadia neighborhood and frequents many of the wonderful restaurants and hotels this City has to offer.  After hearing MANY negative reviews from co-workers, family, and friends, my fiancé and I decided to give the W Hotel Scottsdale a shot prior to forming an opinion of our own for this hotel/restaurant/bar.During a night out on the town with visiting and local friends, we opted to give this place a try.  Upon approaching the entrance of the bar, security tells us that we're not welcome here due to one of the members of our party not having closed toe shoes and another not having a collared shirt.  The attire our group was wearing was more than appropriate for any Phoenix/Scottsdale restaurant/bar.  Let me remind you that's is July in Phoenix, and over one-hundred degrees at the time of night we went to the W and the six of us just finished a dinner at an adjacent, popular restaurant.  The staff was flat out rude to not only us, but others in line wanting and willing to spend money and support the local hotel.I will strongly suggest not staying here or supporting the quality of business they are running here.  During a time of a slowing economy and tourism, many businesses are forced to rely solely on the best possible customer service to attract and retain business--the W Hotel fell way short of this.I was very discouraged after our experience here and will agree with the many other reviewers that this place in not worth supporting.  Phoenix/Scottsdale has many great places to experience, so don't settle for this place.~~#~0
Worst enchiladas EVER and decor from a 1980's attempt at a mexican restaurant.  Taco Bell is a step up!  But if you like soupy enchiladas drowning in cheez wiz this is the place for you.~~#~0
I now consider myself an Arizonian. If you drive a lot on the 101 or 51 like I do, you'll get your fair share of chips on your windshield. You'll also have to replace a windshield like I had to do just recently. Apparently, chips and cracking windshields  is common in Arizona. In fact, I seem to recall my insurance agent telling me that insurance companies must provide this coverage in Arizona.I had a chip repaired about a year ago near the very bottom of the windshield. Just recently a small, very fine crack started traveling north on the windshield from the repaired chip (a different vendor repaired the chip). I called these guys over to my house and they said it was too long to fix, so they replaced the whole windshield the next day.What great service, they come out to your residence or place of business to repair or replace your windshield.~~#~1
I love everything at Market bistro, but I especially love the salads.  I always get the create your own with their homemade and delicious buttermilk Caesar dressing on the side.  That dressing is totally addictive!  The other thing I would wholeheartedly recommend is the Market pizza with goat cheese, artichoke hearts, oven roasted tomato, baby spinach, mozzarella, parmesan and basil pesto sauce.  It is probably my favorite vegetarian pizza.  You can get it by the slice at lunch, but have to order a whole pizza for dinner.I've had the corn chowder with poblano chiles soup and it was great.  I've not tried the roasted garlic tomato soup but my friend loves it.  Had a sandwich here once, with tri-tip with caramelized onions, but it doesn't seem to match the description of the ones currently on the menu.  The only thing I haven't loved so far is their Margherita pizza.Everyone here is always nice and friendly.  I love that it's family-owned and still doing well enough to open another location.  They now have online ordering, which I can't wait to try!~~#~1
This place far exceeded my expectations and is far better than staying at a Hilton Garden Inn or Hampton Inn. This place is QUIET, CLEAN and for the money, you can't beat this place. It includes a HOT breakfast each day which means real eggs and hash browns served to you at a sit down cafe. This alone saves about $10 per person per day while traveling!This place has THREE pools (nice if you don't want to hang out near the bar), basketball court, laundry facilities, restaurant, plenty of parking, free wi-fi, full kitchen, great housekeeping service (they cleaned our dirty dishes!), and a very courteous front desk staff.The only downsides were the dim lighting and not enough wastebaskets or tissue boxes. But for the peace and quiet, I'll take that trade-off anyday!! This place would be excellent for hosting reunions because of the pools, basketball courts and several sets of bbq's on central courtyards.If you are looking for a fancy place, this isn't it. But it is an incredible bargain, comfortable, and very quiet.~~#~1
Always fresh and perfectly prepared. This is the only place my husband will take Japanese visitors from out of town. Enough said.~~#~1
Love this place. Everyone is fantastic. The girls up front can be spacey at times but their system is great and the email reminders are perfect.~~#~1
We were in town on Business and Pleasure and had a chance to visit Aiello's with our Children, 10 and 7.  What a TREMENDOUS experience it was overall and then to top it all off, a chance to win "dinner on the house" via drawing a number out of a bucket, was simply superb.  We didn't win but will definitely come back next time we are in town as the food, staff, and overall dining experience was unbeatable!~~#~1
We went to check out PNP for their 2 Year Anniversary show and were extremely impressed!  Space 55 is the most charming space that I never would've known existed had it not been for this show being promoted on Yelp!  The actors were amazing and we really were in awe the entire time we watched this 30 minute film being created right in front of us!  I'd heard of Comedy Improv, but Movie Improv?  I had no clue... Special shout outs to Mark J and Jenn H (our very own Phoenix yelpers) who did an incredible job on Saturday night.  Congrats again, PNP, on your 2 year anniversary!  I look forward to attending future performances for sure!~~#~1
WOW!!! practically half price on everything compared to the chain stores.  Staff is always very friendly and helpful, and i've literally saved hundreds of dollars since I discovered this store just under a year ago!~~#~1
YIKES!! Its a good thing that this place it a far drive for me - cuz it could spell trouble. If you ever have a craving for a real delight and want to really 'enjoy a silent moment'.....try one of their coconut, lemon or dark chocolate cupcakes. Honestly I didnt care how many calories are in them....I was weak in the knees. There is standing room only in this shop  - literally I think my bathroom is bigger -but a big thumbs up for the cupcakes, and kudos on their packaging!!. (its definitely built into the pricing!)~~#~1
I have to say I am not a big Valentine's fan. I don't like Hallmark holiday's. We ended up by chance going to MiMi's for Valentine's Day and they had a great menu and price for that menu for the evening. I am just impressed by their service, portion size and just the overall experience. I just love this place.~~#~1
My part Jewish friend has been raving about this deli so come payday we went to check it out. Ive been in Phoenix a little over a month and have been getting sick from the food here...diarrhea lots, shit my pants once... anyway, i like to eat in divey non-american cuisine. This place aint seedy enough for me, I suppose.I did not get ill from the food hereHowever.... $12.95 for a sandwich, fries, and a dollop of soggy coleslaw ???I kept hearing from my friend, his mom and the waitress that the sandys are HUGE.nope.Thought we might split one.nope.My sandwich was flavorless..err..thats a lie.. it tasted like stale bread.$29.98 for 2 sandwiches and 2 sodas (its an effin sandwich!!!). I only had $40 (only ?)Left the waitress $5.Gave my friend the other $5 to put toward a plane ticket to New York where he might experience Kosher (and a bit of his heritage) on a more realistic scale...the fries were good tho.~~#~0
Habaneros is an awesome little gem stuck in the strip mall hell known as Scottsdale.  If you are one looking for an original meal at a decent price, try out Habaneros.  I am addicted to their chipotle sauce.  You can find it in almost every item there.  Try out the Shrimp or Fish tacos, they are delicious.  Sometimes the food takes a little while to cook (and there could be a line).  So be prepared if you are going there on your lunch break.  The salsa is not as spicy as I would like, but I am splitting hairs at this point.Go try Habaneros, you wont be disappointed.  Its a nice change from every unoriginal, corporate restaurant you find in Scottsdale.~~#~1
I went here because all my friends were peeing their pants about how good it is. Wrong.  The slow (perhaps retarted) staff with no customer service, alongside the barely mediocre tasting pizza both contributed to my disdain for this awful eatery. Fuck it...stick to Slices.~~#~0
I LOVE this place.  Great food at great prices with great service in a great atmosphere.  Great variety, great spices, great presentation, great menu.  Every entree gets a cornbread dish skillet to nibble on.  I think I would love everything on the menu.  Can't wait to go back and try them all.  Love It!!~~#~1
I have to give them a 5 for their Guacamole and chips.I am just in love with it.Everytime I go to the US, I have to go there.Cheap, super tasty and I love the salad bowl option they have (as I cannot eat wheat flour).The meat is always tasty and fresh and again .....their guacamole ....the best !!!!Always clean and fresh with friendly staff.Healthy fast food .....Just wish that we had it in Canada !!~~#~1
Fresh and delicious.~~#~1
My boss took us here for a little Holiday lunch the other day and i have been dreaming about the burger ever since! Seriously, the term "cheeseburger" doesn't even to justice to the masterpiece they brought me! And the parmesan and truffle oil fries were amazing, too! The decor is kind of cool, sort of an American Teddy Roosevelt feel... Grand old pictures, deer head, and dark wood mixed with high ceilings and light colors so it doesn't feel all heavy. Ok, back to the food... The burger has applewood smoked bacon and grilled onions mixed into the patty. It is incredibly juicy without being greasy! They top it with Havarti cheese, place it on a buttered grilled brioche bun, and serve it with a couple of different sauces... One was like a garlic butter type of sauce and the other was like a horseradish mayo. I ate every single bite and didn't care that i was stuffed to the gills or looked like a pig in front of my co-workers! To leave any bit of that on the plate would have been a travesty!  I can't wait to take hubby here for lunch (dinner would be wayyyyyyy too expensive).~~#~1
Gross, plain and simple!  I'll crave some quick Chinese Food and then I'm always upset.  What a waste of money!~~#~0
What a great way to spend Easter morning!After taking part in the egg hunt on the main grounds (and BTW, they know how to do it here: Massive dumps of eggs full of goodies. More than the kids could carry. Plenty of photo ops. Parents who weren't acting out scenes from Soylent Green.) we made our way to this nicely upscale coffee shop/casual dining spot. We were seated 30 minutes ahead of our reservation, keeping my little guy from popping a gasket. I chose the $19 breakfast buffet, and considering it included a custom-made omelette with organic ingredients--as well as juice and coffee--it was a steal. Service was wonderful and the staff was sure to make us feel at home. Well, actually better than home because I don't have people looking after my every whim and need while at home.~~#~1
Simply stated..............a GREASY burger from start to finish..NOT 4 me....This place I will avoid while I continue on to a real good burger joint.!!~~#~0
I'm very displeased with the service I receive from the Republican party in Arizona.  First, they provide us with John McCain.  Then, Jan Brewer.  Then they crap SB 1070 all over us, which we didn't even vote on.  I've never received anything but lousy politics from these people.~~#~0
I had to do some painting and needed help locating items and suggestions from the staff and boy were they ever helpful.  Nothing like Home Depot, where you have to go and hunt down an employee and when you do they can't wait to get back to their break or whatever was more important than their customer.  I was just overwhelmed by the courteous and quick service I received at this location.  Even their quality of garden plants surpassed several other super stores.~~#~1
This is my favorite spot, waterfalls everywhere, beautiful flowers, fun slide, and great food!~~#~1
Simply magnificent. Easily the best Mexican food I've had the pleasure of enjoying in the States. I can't stop thinking about the carne asada Torta. The rice and beans are the best I've eaten. Tacos are simple and delicious. The most exciting part about it is that I get to go back and try the famed Bombero Burrito and other, more "exotic" things like the lengua and menudo!You must go!~~#~1
One of the best dining experiences we had in Phoenix. And what a surprise, without Yelp we would have never found this wonderful "hole in the wall" in a space the width of a bowling alley. I had The Italian which was Pepperoni, salami, ham, mozzarella, basil, tomatoes & marinara wrapped in a delicious pastry shell. Imagine a gourmet hot pocket. Mmmmmmmmmmmm~~#~1
Cafe Monarch is more than a restaurant - it's an experience. If I had to put an analogy to this one - I would say that most restaurants are like watching a concert on tv and this place is like being in the front row at a great show. I was immersed in Christopher's beautiful world and entertained the entire time.As Camille H mentioned, this place may not be for everyone. There is no menu provided to pick things from. This is not a place for a quick snack, although, I bet if you asked, Christopher would provide it. If you are a picky eater or have food allergies, call ahead of time. But if you go in with the mindset that you are going to be surprised with a meal full of the freshest ingredients, wonderful combinations of flavors and fantastic stories to every dish, you will not be disappointed.I am not sure I would bring my five year old to this place. She would enjoy it, but I think my husband and I will get most out of our dining experience with a babysitter. Since Christopher is a one man show - chef, server, host, story teller, etc. etc, each course takes awhile, and my child's attention span most likely would not last through the entire meal.For a description of the amazing food we ate, please see Camile H's review. She described everything perfectly.This is my new favorite place in the valley. I can't wait to go back! Highly highly highly recommend this experience!!!~~#~1
I have been coming to Lai Lai's for many years now and have never had a bad experience!  The food is always great, and if you mess it up you have no one to blame except yourself since you decide what all you want in your bowl lol.  Sometimes I don't make it in for a year or so but the staff always remembers me and that makes me feel very much at home.  Lai Lai's is great!~~#~1
I've only been here once, for breakfast, but I was very impressed and hope to make it back again soon!~~#~1
I really enjoy writing reviews praising a place for great food, service, ambiance, and value, or any combination of these. Unfortunately, this isn't one of those reviews. This is a fish story... No, not about the big one that got away. Nor is it about the time I was fly fishing with my dad and had to rescue him because he stepped in a deep hole and sank when his waders filled with water.... this is about the trout that saved the day.When my wife and I arrived at the Greene House, it was earlier in the evening, still happy hour, though we were there for dinner not appetizers. Checked-in with the hostess and were quoted a  quoted 30-45 minute wait for a table. We knew the place was popular so weren't upset with the wait as we were looking forward to a wonderful dinner.Went to the bar to order wine and that's when our disappointment started. We were sitting in plain view at the edge of the bar facing the entry and there were TWO bartenders,  In spite of this, in the 15 minutes we waited, occasionally waving and saying "excuse me" to get the bartenders' attention, we never even got so much as a Hi, and certainly not an opportunity to order a drink.I had only just told my wife I wasn't willing to wait another 15-30 minutes wine free when the hostess pleasantly surprised us by saying a table was ready. Our relief was short lived however.After being seated, it was approximately 5 minutes before our server came to the table. We ordered wine and water.Our wine and water came NINE minutes later... a total of over 30 minutes since we entered the restaurant before we received our first beverage.We skipped an appetizer, planning ahead for dessert, and for our entree ordered Rainbow Trout with a side of Truffle Parmesan Fries.Approximately 15 minutes later, our SIDE of Truffle Parmesan Fries showed up... sans trout. When asked about the missing trout, she said it'd be a few more minutes because the kitchen was backed up. When asked why she brought the side of fries, she said she thought we wanted them first, a leap of logic that totally escaped us. When our server said she could take the fries back "to keep them warm until our trout was ready", my wife and I looked at each other in amazement and made a spontaneous decision that given we were now STARVING, our original side of fries would serve us better as a hot appetizer than as a reheated side with dinner.Finally, a few minutes after our Truffle Parmesan Fries were gone, our trout arrived. As I indicated in the begining, it saved the day. The fish was fresh, perfectly prepared and exceptional.As good as the trout was however, is wasn't good enough to make us ever return to the Greene House. There is no reason any customer should suffer through such slow and uninspired service when there are at least a dozen restaurants within a 2 mile radius of this one (much less dozens more throughout the Phoeniz metro area), that are SIGNIFICANTLY more enjoyable. Spend your hard earned money somewhere else~~#~0
This place is so cooli was startled to find that Tempe has something like thisIt reminded me of the C.A.T. in Eugene.There are soo many bike parts, and tools, frames of all kindsfrom what i've learned is that you can pay a small sum and build your own bicycle here, or offer to volunteer and have your bike for free by working off the debti came here a while back to see if they had anything of interest, and wouldnt you know it that on my way a nut and bolt fell off of my stirrup so i thought perfect, now i can get anotherthe dude running the operation didnt charge me a thingso i left like a $1 in the tip jarit's such a priveledge to have something like this for the community, i just hope enough ppl reinvest their time into it so it can exist for generations of cyclists to come.~~#~1
Long wait for food, waitresses that don't know what they're doing, grumpy hosts, and crappy food that keeps us off the lake for 2 hours is not somewhere I plan on going ever again.~~#~0
5 ENTHUSIASTIC STARSThis is a large, well maintained botanical garden, teeming with birdlife and abundant in blooming cacti, succulents & other flowers.Even though it can be HOT, it is very easy to spend half a day here, as we did, wandering the trails. If you need a break, there is a patio cafe where you can get a cool one.This place is a true delight and a great asset for Phoenix.~~#~1
5 stars? Definitely!Upon walking in, everything from the atmosphere, decor and staff was warm and inviting. We each ordered a 3 course meal, and agreed on different selections. The addition of a homemade mozzarella appetizer and an amazing dessert meant we each tasted 8 dishes that night. 8 amazingly unique and delicious dishes. We tasted from every section of their menu, including raw (butterfish and albacore), cooked (gnocchi and risotto), and meat (short rib and pork belly). Pretty much everything was "my favorite," and a couple of glasses of Barbara complemented the meal perfectly. It was pretty quiet on the night we visited... if I may make a suggestion it would be to GO GO GO to Crudo. Like, now.~~#~1
Really delicious breakfast burritos! They are true Mexican-style! I get the ham and egg breakfast burrito and it comes with cheese and a fresh tortilla. They are inexpensive and really big! I'm so glad I work a mile from this place! I go at least once a week!~~#~1
Had my Snaaz 5k walk for education very beautiful park!!! Clean and would be perfect for walking a dog! There's lots of parking and also there is a desert in downtown Phoenix how nice! Real Arizona feel! I would definitely take my parents or my aunt for a nice walk on a fall morning :)~~#~1
I have received two pedicures and a manicure from this location.  I usually prefer a more spa like experience but the cost is low and I was attempting to save a few dollars.  Cutting cost may not be a good thing to do when it comes to body care.  I won't be returning because I am concerned about health violations.Pros:Quick serviceCheaper than the spa, salonCons:Improper cleaning of foot baths.  I thought they were good until I saw them seat a women at a used station.  They only took the sprayer and rinsed the dirty bowl.  (I did let her know)The foot massage was more like a foot beating.  About an hour later my ankles felt like I had rolled them.  It took almost two weeks for them to feel normal again.The sent in the shop is of fake nails.  If everyone has on a mask, I would like one to.~~#~0
Very yummy, my favorite roll is the Las vegas, and here they make a good one and it's 1/2 off during happy hour. I keep meaning to come for the all you can eat sushi! Try the Ice Cream sushi roll, this is one of the only places I know that does it and it is delicious!~~#~1
I've been planning a visit to the Public Market for some time now, and was downtown today so I finally stopped in for lunch.  I had the "Friggin Chicken", which was friggin delicious.  The market fare is counter service, but when I was ordering the cashier was very friendly and courteous and brought my food to me out on the patio.This was a very pleasant first experience, sitting on the patio reading a book, sipping my canned mint green tea, and eating my sandwich with a side of couscous.  The atmosphere was very relaxed and there were others nearby sharing a bottle of wine, or just finishing up their lunch with good conversation.  Speaking of the wine, there was an impressive wine and craft beer selection.  I'll be going back to sample the beverages very soon.On my way out, I stopped at the coffee bar for a latte, which was much more bold and flavorful than your "Fast Food Coffee" variety; a great way to finish off my lunch.  If you're looking for a quick, inexpensive, fresh and local dining experience, check this place out.~~#~1
Ugh. I don't like giving a tough review, but this is a store that needs to address a couple things.1. The Service: Long lines and unpleasant cashiers. 2. Outdated Store: This wouldn't be so obvious if they just did a little cleanup and merchandising.3. Produce: Maybe in this store they should just no offer produce. The little corner in the store makes you think it was an afterthought. I think just a couple things that wouldn't cost much money would go a long way in making this store a go to place for me. Not there right now.~~#~0
We had read about this place on  Yelp and a local had highly recommended it as well.  It is located in an office building and not easy to find unless you know in advance that it is in the back of a big office building with a big parking lot.  I will preface this by saying that we had just eaten the night before at a highly regarded Scottsdale restaurant in which the service was awful.  Therefore, this place won a lot of points with the 4 of us immediately because the service was outstanding from start to finish.  The restaurant itself is huge and it is beautifully decorated and immaculate.  You walk in and they have a huge open fire spit BBQ chickens and Beef.  For starters we had a  Caesar Salad--a shrimp cocktail--a bit pricey and just okay, and a good house salad.  I ordered their simply grilled fish of the day which was Swordfish with Guacomole on top and a corn butter on the side served with rice.  It was a good portion and it was delicious.  My wife had Salmon on a plank which was also very good.  One of our friends had Short Ribs with Dr. Pepper BBQ sauce and grits.  The portion was huge and he raved about the dish. Our other friend had the Duck Breast and it was very good.  We had a nice wine recommended by our waitress that was reasonably priced and very good.  The whole experience was excellent and we will go again when we come back to Scottsdale.~~#~1
Love this gym. Not many know it's here..lunch time is the best to get in. I've been a member since Feb of 2009. While the trainers are nice, it's a revolving door. You are better off at this gym if you know what you're doing vs. needing 1-to-1 attention. Since LA Fitness just purchased PURE, this will only increase I imagine. Pretty disappointed that they no longer do monthly 're-programs'... But the gym itself is worth the monthly fee. If you're looking for a place to be left alone to workout - this is it.~~#~1
Our go to pizza place! Don't see how they could improve in any area. Customer service is excellent, immaculately clean and the food is PERFECTION!~~#~1
Hands down the best cupcakes in the Phoenix market. Tammie Coe comes in second with the coconut but sometimes it's not as fresh as it could be at LGO. Milk chocolate is great, taste a sprinkle - it's really chocolate not wax. I had salted caramel it was wonderful. Dark chocolate is decadent. I did try the red velvet and it was good but I'm done trying to understand red velvet. I just don't get it.~~#~1
I had a great experience with this company today.  They sent out their tech Steve to fix my Samsung tv.  He arrived on time and was able to quickly diagnose and fix the problem.  He also provided some helpful tips to improve the performance of the tv in other areas unrelated to the issue.The service was professional, prompt, and efficient.  I would definitely use them again in the future.~~#~1
I can not believe that pizza could be this good. I had good pizza on a recent trip to NY, and this really is the closest that I can find to the pizza out there.They say that its the water, but I am skeptical of that. I guess it doesn't matter what they did to make the pizza, it was really, really good.~~#~1
This is the most progressive, inclusive, welcoming, diverse, intellectually stimulating, public-service oriented church in the Valley, if not the West Coast.  We've been to more than a few and can attest to that.  Pastor Jeff not only knows everyone's name but is genuinely concerned about everything that goes on in your life.  The congregation is like one big family.  Love for your neighbors is not just a commandment at this church - it's acted upon.  If you're sick of churches that tell you what to believe in and don't act what they preach, you'd better check this one out.  Services every Sunday at 9:30am.~~#~1
Dr. Ellis is compasionate, caring, and really demonstrates his passion for what he does. The entire staff made us feel comfortable from the moment we walked in to the time we left the office. They went the extra step to make sure my 5 year old was having fun at the dentist! I would recommend this office to anyone who has children. Dr. Ellis and his team are the best!~~#~1
So happy to have another option in our great restaurant rich neighborhood. The space is much larger than it appears from the street, and is broken up really well into comfortable areas. The open kitchen really does have an Italian country feel, and the lighting gives the very large open room a warm feel. Nice large bar as well. Best of all is the number of walls that open up to the outside-perfect for this time of year. Our server had the perfect combination of personality and humor-not too much, just right. The menu has a great selection, no matter your appetite. The Burratta was nice and creamy, with a nice compliment of apple slices and Rocket. The potatoes with parmesan, rosemary and perfect lemony aioli were off the chain. I wanted an order to take home! Pizza crust is very tasty and perfect texture. Hanger steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The brunch menu looks super yummy-we definitely have a new hangout on the hood. Great job, Sam Fox!~~#~1
Thanks to Chris L's first review, OTFM has been on my list of places to go for quite some time.  Unfortunately, I just can't seem to get my act together on Saturday mornings.  Today was the day.  I was ready by 9 (am, not pm)!After a quick stop at the ATM, we were there, Yelp canvas bags in hand, and not disappointed.  I had to get that chocolate cherry bread from Phoenician Bakery.  I sampled an itsy, bitsy little piece and it was still like heaven exploded in my mouth.  We also purchased zucchini bread, honey (which I've already mixed with some mascarpone cheese and slathered on strawberries), grapefruit marmalade (yum), dates, and fresh flowers.The breakfast burritos from Gil's Taste of Taos were some damn good burritos.  Saving for next time...fresh produce (the lines were already long for McClendon's and I'm not one to wait for veggies) and everything else I wanted (like tamales).We saw our own Gabi K's other half wandering down the street too...he looked so lost without her:(  Hope he brought her some flowers.~~#~1
Ugh!!  A 25 min wait greeted us before anyone recognized our presence.  We were offered complientary champaigne in consideration.  Who drinks champainge??We were allowed to order wine prior to hearing of the chef's feast, which offers a wine pairing.  That's dumb.We ordered a meat/cheese plate.  It contained head cheese.  Hmmmm.  Overpriced and oversalted.30 min later our salads came.  The salads were ok and unfortunately the highlight of the meal.35 min later our main course came.  Overcooked, uneventful, lame.I can't drink alcohol and ordered water.  Twice I was left w/ no water for extended periods.  Both times I was foced to ask for water.There were no hand towels in the unisex bathroom.  It's no fun to dry your hands using toilet paper.The "best" part was saved for last.  Quiessence automatically adds an 18% gratuity, which is OK assuming the service is at least adequate.  It wasn't.  Further, as our waiter dropped the bill, he explained the 18% "goes to the house" and anything additional we might addd, though not required, is most appreciated.  Egad....why does the house need a service charge w/ the magnificent margins they charge for their normal food service?  And why do they put their staff in the position of shaking down their patrons for tips?Although it's a very nice, calming setting, I found myself wanting to leave after the first appy.  Food, service and ancillary were simply terrible.  Stay away.  You'll spend your $175 for 2 much better most anywhere else.~~#~0
Amazing thrift store! The owner was extremely kind and polite to me so I'm not too sure why one reviewer was saying he was rude. They had baskets of clothes out front that were free for homeless or needy people which I thought was great considering places like goodwill often overcharge for clothing that should be donated to those in need. Great find on a Robert cavalli jacket and J.crew pants that were literally like new. Prices were completely reasonable for quality second hand clothing. For sure will go back!!!~~#~1

As a former Bay Area resident, I have come to love and appreicate all asian food. Generally, I prefer Japanese and Thai over Chinese, however, when it comes to Iron Chef it's my favorite.  The location is perfect as it's only a quick two or three minute drive from my house.  Their food is absolutely delcious and is on par with a high end chinese restaurant.  The quality of the meat, fish and vegetables is just excellent and it's always very consistent.  I generally order the garlic chicken as I love spicy food!  It's a wonderful mix of vegetables and white meat and the sauce is perfect, full of flavor and not at all greasy.  I also like the fact that they offer brown rice as an option and their eggrolls are some of the best I've tasted.  The family meal for $29.95 is an excellent value and is enough food for four or five people.   We ordered it for the two of us and had leftovers for a week!  It includes sweet/sour pork, broccoli beef, orange chicken, chow mein, fried rice, steamed rice, soup and eggrolls.  I sure hope that Iron Chef survives the recession.  I try to eat there as often as I can :)~~#~1
The bar and wait staff couldn't be better at this location of PF Chang's.  The food and service is better than any other 'Chang's' country-wide.  We just moved here from NY and missed our "local hangout".  The bar tenders and wait staff have made us feel at home.  We go at least once per week for wonder food, drink, and company with the staff and other patrons.  Thank you Clint, Gerry, Nate, Kyle, Nick, Angie, et al.~~#~1
This is a family owned local restaurant at it's best. If you like to explore and support locally owned businesses, you should definitely give this one a try. They have a big menu and I have tried breakfast and lunch and both were excellent, but the breakfast is particularly good. I love the breakfast burrito. (to the reviewer that complained about the greasy chorizo...hello, it is chorizo, chorizo is sausage). I would go out of my way to stop and eat here whenever in the general area.~~#~1
Thanks for helping me to find Valley Eyecare Center, fellow Yelpers!  I visited their office as a new patient and knew from the moment I walked in that it was going to be a positive experience.  The receptionist was  friendly, the office was modern and clean, and the wait was super-short (~3 mins). I was impressed with care that was provided and didn't feel rushed when working with Dr. Eric Clyde or his assistant.  The three words that come to mind when thinking of this office are: professional, prompt, and accurate.  My visit was for a contact lens fitting, so no comment on their frame selection / service.~~#~1
A yummy Mexican Sunnyslope dive.  The oatmeal horchata is tasty!  THE torta is really an experience!~~#~1
BBQ Chicken plate is excellent! My wife says that the half order is fine. Usually take orders to go and food is ready on-time! We eat here on a monthly basis.~~#~1
Tim is really a very friendly and honest guy. He will tell you what you need or what can wait. This place is worth going to! It will save you tons of money!~~#~1
When we first got here I felt disappointed until I realized the zoo is much larger than it first appears. Particularly worthy of checking out - the lions and tigers. Also do not pass up the monkey walk. The little squirrel monkeys are fun to watch. Be sure to shell out the extra bucks to feed the giraffes. It's a unique experience to be so close to these large, yet gentle, creatures. Definitely my favorite part of my visit.Visit Date: 11/19/09~~#~1
Decided to call CityWide based on positive online reviews. We suspected a slab leak and a really expensive repair. Robert showed up within 20 minutes, determined the source of the leak within 5 minutes, and it turned out to be something really simple and inexpensive. He repaired it with a brand new line, we paid, and he left within a half hour of us calling CityWide. Very professional, friendly, and efficient! Would definitely recommend CityWide for anyone's plumbing needs.~~#~1
Potbelly, you have been handed the torch.It was a good ride Jimmy Johns, but you have no locations close to my newly purchased home.  Its not you, its me.  I promise.I love italian-style subs.  The Wreck at Potbelly is fantastic.  The Wreck salad is also great (for a salad).  This place is my new go to sub shack.~~#~1
Okay, this just might sum it up... I LOVE YOGURTLAND WITH ALL OF MY HEART! Go get some yogurt, the end. No but seriously, do go. :) All of these yogurt places have been popping up everywhere the past couple years, and when Mojo opened up at the Biltmore I loved it, but it was far away. Then, yogurtland opened up right next to where I live and i discovered it WAS BETTER! Sooo many flavors, and they change a few of them out every once in awhile. They have all the normal yogurt toppings, plus white chocolate sauce, chocolate sauce, and caramel sauce. Hello? Isn't this supposed to be healthy? Haha, it actually is if you take advantage of their freshly cut fruit. I just love it. I took my brother and he is the first person I've seen to grab the biggest cup they have, I asked him why and he said, "It's so good, I can take some home and put it in the freezer for later." My favorite is pistachio yogurt with gummie bears! Record is 5 times in one week... message me if you've beat that.~~#~1
And then it all changed...I think this is my very first review that has been demoted to 1 star after being on the coveted 5 star for a long time. So, where do I start. After feeling dog sick for a few days, I finally decided to "walk-in" to this place because that's what they do now supposedly. They take walk in patients who are seen by the NP. I signed in at 8:20 and was not called in the back until 10:00am. Then I waited another 35 minutes for the NP to come in and see me. By the time everything was over, it was 11:00am before I walked out of this place. I asked to talk to Brenda, the office manager and was brushed off twice. Supposedly she is going to call me but would not see me when i was there for two and a half hours! I guess she didn't have the balls to face me at that point. What could she have said really? The front desk lady did a screw up and let another walk in patient go before me even though he came 10 minutes after I had already signed in. When I pointed that out, she said he came before me and I had to show her the sign in chart. Instead of apologizing, she just kept doing what she was busy doing without acknowledging her mistake. When the NP did come see me, she missed a couple of key things in my chart that she totally should have asked me about. I was quite appalled. I had to point out a deathly allergy that I have even though it should already be in my chart. My final analysis: In my opinion, don't go here if your health and time are valuable to you.~~#~0
What an exciting time.  I am writing my first YELP review about the wonderful MOJO Yogurt  I visited yesterday afternoon.   There were so many wonderful flavors to choose from and the people there were nice enough to pass out tiny little sample cups.  It was a challenge narrowing down my selections to a few flavors but I somehow managed.  I ended up with Birthday Cake (that's right, there is Birthday Cake flavored yogurt, life IS good), Cafe Latte, and the divine Original Tart.  After throwing on a few gummy bears I was a happy girl.  I see in other reviews that some complained about pricing but I am willing to pay a little extra for quality and happiness.~~#~1
Thanks to Yelp I was able to find this hidden jewel.  The place looks like a spanish style motel converted into a restaurant.  With a cute garden in the back.  I had already eaten so didn't intend on a 2nd breakfast.  But stingy GF only allowed me a few bites so I had to ask Chris to whip up  another plate for me.   It was my first time having chilled salmon done that way and it was so good.  Everything tasted so fresh.   For the price you get to drink all you want.  And I must have had at least 10 glasses of the orange juice with mixed berries.   The food and the atmosphere reminds me of eating in Napa, CA.   Will definitely return when I'm in town.~~#~1
This is one of my new favorites places to bring people who are from out of town. It's something different that I think real "Foodies" will enjoy. Although the restaurant itself is dark and cramped, it's worth going to over and over again. I ordered the Shepherd's Pie Pasty, it was very filling and delicious. Although I had to wait 20 minutes for it, it was worth waiting for a fresh out of the oven pasty. But if you're ever in a rush, a good thing about this place, is that you can call ahead and request for them to start cooking your pasty so that it is ready to be served once you arrive.~~#~1
Apparently fellow yelper Andrew and I are meeting in our dreams over maple bacon creme brulee! I'm seriously glad to see that I am not the only one having subconcious yearnings for this lil dab of heaven in a cup! All of the products are top notch though and who doesn'tlike creme brulee? Communists maybe? Chef Eric is awesome and so friendly too.~~#~1
I love this place, sure its kinda creepy and in the middle of an odd office complex but DAMN those donut holes chocolate cake not the glazed ones are good!  Not to mention the NINJA BOWLS!!  Good God get the Sizzling ninja, top that off with a fried egg, and pineapple, get healthy with some brown rice and white chicken and then DRENCH that bowl with NINJA SAUCE AND SRIRACHA (which comes standard btw) AMAZING! Don't waste your life away without having one of these ninja bowls at this donut shop, i never thought i would be able to say that statement with a straight face but i did!  And for those wondering they don't serve pirates (some will understand this fact)  Also if you come back a few times they might throw some free donut holes at YOUR FACE LIKE NINJA STARS!!  I joke they don't throw them but you may get some for free (really though)!~~#~1
Awesome loose leaf tea spot in the North Phoenix area. You can have a cup/pot of tea in-house, or buy a variety of teas to go.HUGE selection of loose leaf teas. If you're a tea fan, a visit to Souvia is a must-do.~~#~1
I have eaten here several times before...and I don't think I have ever left upset,  I've always enjoyed my meals, but this time I can honestly  say that I enjoyed all of my courses!  I was with a group of four other girls.  We all started off with the amuse.  It was some sort of sous vide duck on toast.  It was really good.  Next we had our choice out of four starters...I along with three other girls had the sauteed scallop.  So beautiful!  Four out of five of us ordered the beef tenderloin.  It melted in my mouth...It was perfectly cooked.  The only bad thing is that I wanted more!  Finally, you get to chose from four desserts.  I don't like sweets, so I always bring it home to the kids.  But, they are so beautiful! Now for the price...my meal was only $13 for everything!  It doesn't get any better than that.  I also ordered the orangecello for an extra $3.  Well worth it!Only sad part is that we were the only table there...Makes me sad!  Everyone is missing out.Our server also took us on a tour of the school afterwards!~~#~1
I picked up some brownies as holiday treats this year and they did not disappoint! These are the richest, chocolatiest, moistest, biggest (3" square) brownies you will find! I'm tellin' ya! TOTALLY worth the drive to Gilbert - except they're taking their own holiday break right now, so you'll have to wait until after Jan. 4, 2010 to get your fix! Still, worth the drive and worth the wait!!~~#~1
No question -- my FAVORITE burger in the valley!I first got turned on to Lobbys at a Yelp Office Hours -- http://www.yelp.com/biz/september-office-hours-at-lobbys-tempe#hrid:kQOElzgklMRbAyWS8LhVFw - - and by my check-ins, you can see i've frequented there since. I've tried a lot of other "great" burgers -- 5 Guys, Smashburger, etc - but IMHO, none of them stack up to the food and the experience at Lobbys. The burgers at Lobbys are so good that I crave them --I want to drive across town or plan out my day so that I'm in the area to get one! I just feel that there's more quality ingredients with a Lobbys burger -- the bun, the taste, the way the cheese melts over the whole patty, the special sauce, and the burger itself. And just as Lynn W says the service is truly superior here and " He (Lobby) really cares about his business and it shows". I've recommended many friends to check out Lobbys and have brought a few friends here -- everyone has loved it! Especially my Chicago friends that live in the valley. Lobbys burgers is that raised bar that I measure all other burger joints to.~~#~1
By far the best asian market in the entire valley! I first discovered Lee Lee's tempe location and was so happy when they opened this location in the west valley.  Amazing selection from produce, meats, and asian. The staff is super nice. Never have had a poor experience in all the years. Shelves are clean and organized.  Prices are great too.~~#~1
This was definitely the best meal of this year's holiday trip....The Kale Caesar! is a very creative interpretation of the timeless classic.  We loved the melted Scamorza cheese.  I had the Applewood Smoked Duck for my entree, accompanied by a glass of the Siduri pinot from Willamette.  The wine was perfect with the cherry sauce, besides the fact that pinot is a classic pairing with duck.  A glass of Siduri for $12 is a great deal, too.  I loved the way the duck was prepared, too, and it did not weigh me down afterwards like duck often can, either.My wife had the buttermilk roasted chicken along with a glass of their creative (and delicious) interpretation of sangria.  Roasted Brussels sprouts and sweet corn are part of the presentation.  Dessert was the decadent Dream Pudding Jar.  We always get excited about an original dessert dish, and this one did not disappoint.Service was top notch all the way, also.~~#~1
Found the doctor via his website and called for an appointment. The ladies that answer the phone are sweet so I felt I made a good choice. I was taken into the room and a sweet girl asked me questions and told me the doctor would be right in. He came in quickly and asked if I would mind if someone that was following him would be present. Fine. The other guy walked in along with a lady (medical assistant maybe). No one introduced either of them. Dr. Racette didn't ask me one question and didn't address any of my concerns. He seemed to even brush off the questions I asked or responded with brusqueness. It was very irritating as a patient to be asking questions about serious topics like skin cancer and feel blown off. He prescribed a cream for me and was walking out the door minutes after seeing me and said he would have someone come in with the script. He never talked to me about how the cream works or what it does. Awful awful. Too top it off, they were supposed to call me with test results. I had to call them and the gal that answered said, "no one called you with the results yet?: NO!! Will not see this doctor again. Sorry but I actually prefer doctors that care to take the time and actually address my questions and make me feel comfortable, not take 5 minutes to rush me through an appointment.~~#~0
I honestly just got home from visiting Super Farm!  I headed out their way because I wanted to try their milk - we are trying to spend our $$ on local businesses.  It was great to actually speak to the people who raise the cows and see the cows with my own eyes! We ended up staying for about two hours!  Everyone was so friendly.  We bought our gallon of milk ($3.49) and some butter ($4.99) and then stayed for lunch.  Chef Matt - I hope I didn't forget his name!- introduced himself while we were buying milk and we decided to stay for lunch . The kids split a kid's cheeseburger and I had the chicken salad - sandwich.  It was fantastic!! After lunch we visited the baby cows, the goats, and then stopped and had a big glass of flavored milk ($1 each - grape for my 2 yr old daughter and chocolate for my 4 yr old son).  Everyone is so nice here - my children LOVED it and did not want to leave.  Worth the 40-ish minute drive out there.  (We live in South Phoenix)~~#~1
We use yelp.com anytime we are out of town and want a great place to eat. We weren't disappointed again...Ramiro's is great...generous portions, great prices, huge selection...you can even get most everything ala carte. We were visiting my parents and told them about Ramiro's. They said they have driven by many, many times...not any more! I had the biggest, best carnitas chimichanga I have ever seen. Can't wait to come back and have the taco salad. Don't drive by this place!~~#~1
The best Gelato ever...EVER!!!  Yeah I said it.  What?  Seriously, the best customer service I've experienced since the '70s.  By the time I ordered I was nearly full because they encourage customers to try everything - easily 20 different favors to sample and choose from.  My favorites are the dark chocolate, salted caramel, peach champagne, and black cherry.  We've visited multiple times and have never been disappointed - same quality service and deliciousness every time.  My kids referred them to a friend and he owner gave my kids free gelato on their next visit - they appreciate their customers.  If your looking for your next vice, check this place out!~~#~1
I'm sorry. You're too busy to look up my club card information? Too busy too push the button to do the search, enter my phone number and click ok?I took the time once upon whenever to sign up for your card. And now, you can't take 5 seconds to look it up for me? Let me clue you in, the cashiers here have always looked it up. It always takes 5-10 seconds at most! Great customer service. Insert sarcasm here for the uneducated.Other Big Lots this hasn't been a problem. Just the one.~~#~0
Still a great place to eat. A little further from Los Tacos in AJ (home for me) since Los Tacos closed, i frequent here more often..It is good.. I want to add that their green corn tamales are GREAT!  their Green sauce seems to be a popular choice here on YELP's reviews. I like it a lot too!I plan to order more tamales for the holidays! hurrah!~~#~1
After landing in PHX but before embarking on a 2.5 hour drive to Flagstaff, i thought Wendy's would be a safe and easy place to grab some food on the go...well, I was wrong.* Chicken Nuggets: dry, freezer-burned meat with extra hard double-fried shell.* French Fries: super hot, crunchy, over-fried french-fry-shaped fry-shells. so hard and crunchy that i thought i was eating french-fry chips.* Junior Bacon Cheese Burger: bacon and burger meat both tasted dehydrated.Guess what, last thing I want after a 4hr flight and landing in 100+ weather is hot, dry, crunchy, tasteless food!~~#~0
I was skeptical when I kept hearing how amazing Jimmy John's is.  So I went in, and found my new favorite sandwich spot!  The inside was very noisey, but I liked the atmosphere.  The bread had an awesome fresh taste, and when I inquired about the difference between 2 sandwiches, the cashier was very helpful.~~#~1
Walked in during late lunch hour. Did not get acknowledged for about 5 mins. When I finally got sat down, and served my salad, I found a hair in it. Got no apology. Just a sigh firm the waitress when she took it away. You can't pay me to go back here. The waiters are rude.~~#~0
I used Full Circle Auto Body after my daughter's car was in an accident. They were very knowledgable and helpful about insurance issues and got the car repaired quickly. They post progress of your vehicle with photos on their website which is so cool. I'll definitely use them again if the occassion arises.~~#~1
I am basing this review solely on the Cauliflower Soup. Holy Heaven in a cup. We had Zupas cater lunch at the office, so I can't speak to the actual restaurant. But man, I wish I had a bucket of that soup.~~#~1
When a man falls in love, it's a special thing. Not because his calloused hands and heart are finally softening. Not even because he has found something that completes his very living soul. It's special because he is simply, and utterly....happy.Ladies and Gentleman of Yelp....I have found the pizza that makes me happy.I heard all the hype..."best pizza in the country", "Oprah says it's the best", "The Food Network hypes it up", "Chris Bianco learned how to make pizza from Jesus". Ok, I made up the last one.My friend and pizza aficionado, Lance has been known to drive in from Los Angeles...just for this pizza, and then he would drive home. Sometimes, he'd even fly in. It had to be good, right? Tonight, I chose Pizzeria Bianco for my birthday dinner because of the hype. I had made a pathetic attempt to dine here once, but myself and the individual I was with, we both were intimidated by the 3 hour wait. Is any pizza worth three hours? That's a personal judgment call. That night, I ended up dining at Nobuo, across the path....and it was a nice meal.I digress. I've been preparing for this trip. I read up on various press articles, and discovered that as of last week, they are open for lunch AND Mondays! Perfect. Tonight, I dined with my parents. My favorite dining companions. We sat down in the very intimate dining space. No wait at all. Perhaps, people don't know that they are open on Mondays. Fine by me.The decor is nice. Simple, with a classic cucina feel. The brick oven is the star of this place. Clearly.We ordered some bread to get started. It came with a little cup of high end olive oil. Fantastic! The crust was crisp, and the bread was chewy to the point where you can't help but smile when you eat this.The pizza is phenomenal. We ordered two pizzas (for three people). One was half Rosa and half Margherita, the other was the Biancoverde.  This way we were able to try three different kinds of pizza .All three styles were phenomenal. The winner of the three was the Margherita. The tomato sauce doesn't overpower, the mozzarella melts like a dream, and a hint of basil. The Rosa was unique, and also delicious. The Arizona pistachios take some getting used to, but pairs well with the red onion. The Biancoverde was much more complex. Definitely a hearty pizza because of the ricotta cheese. Very tasty. It's topped with arugala, so you will get a nice earthy, and loud flavor. Usually when I eat pizza, I take a bite of the crust, and then I leave the rest. Not here. I went through the entire pizza slice because it's perfect. Chewy, crispy, and full of happy!Take it from me....this place is worth the hype. Look at the reviews from other Yelpers. Even the picky ones love this place.Maybe it's true. Maybe Chris Bianco did learn how to make pizza from Jesus. Sure as hell tastes like it.Now if you are wondering about the other stuff, it was also a five star experience: staff friendly and attentive, and the bathrooms are spotless.Worth the 3 hour wait? YES. Bring all your friends here? YES. Will I guarantee the awesome? YES.#300~~#~1
I'm usually not a fan of indoor tanning but post baby I felt like I needed a little pick me up color. I chose this place because of their good prices- 3 tans in a lay down bed for 17 dollars. The staff is so amazing and friendly and I got a nice brown tint after a couple of sessions.~~#~1
I love their food. Everything has been delicious, though my favorite is "Bahn Mi" inspired fish sandwich. Get it with a side of kale salad!~~#~1
I crave their jalapeno fried rice. AMAZING!~~#~1
had a "cap steak" for the first time. Best steak i have ever had.  Would recommend to anyone.~~#~1
this place is amazing!  So many flavors to choose from!!!!  I LOVE this place!!!!~~#~1
Postino's in Gilbert was stunning! Amazing outdoor/indoor chic atmosphere.  Food and wine were excellent as expected! What another great addition to the Postino family! Loved it!!!!!~~#~1
Absolutely waste of time & space is this establishment. Don't bother checking in with the host to be seated as I saw many people just seat themselves although there was a 20 min wait for others, the staff rude, uncaring & could possibly be where all the servers go that can't get a job in any other Resteraunt. A complete disgrace & I would never give such a place my hard earned money, I suggest you do the same.~~#~0
ADORABLE PLACE!Wraps, Pastas, Salads, Pizza, Gelato, Pastries, Sodas and SuchSuper darling place that makes you feel so comfortable.  Looks like they have computers to use (i don't know if there is a charge). The inside is precious, decorated to the T-- not a single spot was missed.  Our food was placed on a silver tray and handed over to us to sit in a comfy booth and enjoy our wraps and pizza.  It was really good.  The place is just so darn adorable; it's hard to concentrate on the food when everything was so POSH while you NOSH.  Get it?~~#~1
I come here at least 3 or 4 times a month. Best Asian food in Phoenix however it is now closed~~#~1
We love Roys. The service is usually outstanding and the food is wonderful.The ambience is nice and usually pretty hopping on a Saturday.  My water glass is constantly being refilled because the people Roy's employ are totally on the ball. We have dined here 8+ times over the past 2 years and have never had a mediocre meal. They also have a delicious vegetarian menu if you ask your server. The wine list is comprehensive and they are known for their creative cocktails.We have dined here on both special occasions and regular Saturday nights. It is kind of like being on vacation when we go since it is located in the gorgeous JW Marriott. ...definitely in my top three Phoenix area restaurants.~~#~1
Stopped in for the first time at PV Burger Company tonight.  It was quiet, only one table when I got there around 6:20pm.  Ordered a bacon havarti burger with fries and a coke; it came out to just over 9 bucks.  The burger came with lettuce, tomato, cucumber (???), pickled red onions, and thousand island.  It was DELICIOUS.  Beautifully toasted bun, great char on the meat.  The pickled onions were a nice touch.  The fries were skinny and crispy and had seasoned salt, which brings me back to being a kid and getting fries at the food court in the mall (good memories).  I got a refill on my coke before I left, so I don't know what another reviewer was talking about when they said there are no refills on sodas.  I asked and it was no problem.My only gripe is that after I had ordered and sat down to wait for my food, a couple of guys came in and the guy at the counter immediately handed them paper menus (with actual descriptions of the menu items I'm sure, unlike the chalkboard on the wall), which I would have liked.  I probably would have gotten an add-on for my burger if he had given me a paper menu when I was at the counter.  Oh well, now I know for next time, because there will definitely be a next time in the near future :)~~#~1
IF YOU HAVE KIDS YOU MUST READ!!!My husband and I have never been more insulted at a restaurant than tonight at the Hillstone Restaurant (Biltmore).This is the same restaurant group that includes Bandera and Houston's. We deliberately went out early-- at 5pm -- with another couple and our son. He started to fuss on and off during dinner. Mind you the restaurant was already noisy when the GM Miranda Geranios instructed us to leave; other patrons were complaining. That was news to us- and we've seen far worse outbursts in the past from children. Ironically, our son at that moment was playing happily with the other couple when she rudely asserted herself. We were in the middle of dinner and to add insult to injury, she didn't even offer to compensate us for a future visit without our little guy. Just go home without dinner and pay the bill. Of course, she herself has no children. To ask a repeat customer to leave is absolutely disgusting. We will never visit any of their establishments again and wanted to share our unfortunate experience with our friends who also know the challenges of having a family.~~#~0
07/09/2008  Just went there last week for the first, and last, time.  I read the good reviews, so I was expecting much more.  I am a first generation American; both my parents were German and came over in their 20's.  I lived there for a few years, have eaten German food all my life, and have been to many German restaurants in many different states over the years.  I really wanted to like this place, as there are not many German establishments around here, but this place was terrible!  We were the only people in the place at 2pm, and still had horrible service.  ???  We were ignored much of the time and then when the waitress did come, she would forget things we had asked her for.  The waitress didn't understand German, as in the German MENU options, so I ordered from the menu using the English translations, and she was still confused. I had to POINT at the options.  YES, there really is CUCUMBER salad on the menu.  The bread was stale, the schnitzel was hard, there was a hair in my cucumber salad and my potato pancakes were just ...disgusting.  They also gave me fries instead of the usual sides????  I am guessing that they just reheated leftovers from the dinner the night before, because that is exactly what it tasted like.  Plus, I actually got charged the wrong prices - like lunch salad was 3.50, but showed up on my bill as 5.00, etc.  I was too frustrated to even bring it up and just left, disappointed.  Waste of time and money, I will not return.  Maybe at dinner time things are better, but DO NOT EVEN TRY THE LUNCH!  Yuck.Oh, and the website is outdated- wrong prices and discontinued menu items.~~#~0
I keep wanting to like this place.  I want to support a local business, and yet....Last year I took my two boys there after a theater performance (Greasepaint!   Excellent!), and after we placed our orders for lunch, I took out our SET game (it's a card game that does not use a traditional deck - great fun).  WIthin moments, the server was back at our table.  "You can't do that."  "What?  Play cards?  It's not gambling." (Maybe I was wrong, but living here, you start to assume that an objection to something must be religion based).  "The owners don't allow it."  "They don't allow it?  It's a matching game."  "No.  You'll have to put it away."Now.  I would understand not wanting us to sit and play cards if we'd finished eating and were just holding a table (assuming it was busy).   However, this was during the gap between ordering and eating.  I KNOW I should've just left then.  Instead, I made my kids happy and we stayed for lunch (and ice cream!).  A couple months ago I (foolishly) decided to try again.  Didn't bother with the cards this time.  The lousy thing this time was the mold on my son's bread.  They DID remove the sandwich from the bill, but eish.    I'd kind of like the "Restaurant Impossible" guy to come in here and give it an overhaul.  I don't mind the nostalgia stuff, but the place does need a solid going over.~~#~0
This place needs to close their doors, get their act together, and then reopen. The atmosphere is boring and it is obvious that they did the bare minimum coverup from the last restaurant. The food is horribly boring and has no flavor. I ordered the chicken and avocado pizza and it literally tasted like nothing! We also got the nachos (which was actually just a plate of chips with one tiny pinch of cheese and soggy beef). In addition, the server didn't put in my order for my pizza, hardly apologized and then brought it to me 30 minutes after my friends were done eating. One of my friends ordered the ahi tuna and it was switched with someone else's special order so that had to go back to the kitchen and be reordered as well. The only thing I liked was the beer, and that too took forever and I had to remind my server several times to get me a refill. Way to much effort to get food and drink that is sub par at best.~~#~0
Thank you to Sarah L for bringing to my attention that the lunch menu from which I got my information about the $34 crab cake entree was for the NYC location. However, I did note that the crab cake appetizer at the Scottsdale location  - presumably a smaller portion than the lunch entree - is $16. Yes, yes. It is Barney's and I understand the premium pricing. What I question is how Fred's scored only $$. I often eat out with those on a tighter foodie budget than mine; the $$ is misleading, when Oregano's is also $$. Just sayin'.~~#~0
This place is classic goodness! Everything tastes rich and fresh! Has a new modern feel with a twist of luxury and artistic flare. The food presentation is gorgeous and the food tastes even better then it looks! In a wonderful area of town and is built in the old post office. An inventive and one of a kind idea has really set apart this delicious place from any other restaurant in the valley!~~#~1
A hole in the wall in South Phoenix.... I order: The "Betty Boop" - a plate with 1 waffle and 1 fried chicken breast.  Add a huge mason jar of the sweetest & reddest Koolaid (or Sweet Tea - depending on my mood) and a side of grits drowning in melted butter and I'm a happy girl.Their Red Velvet Cake is also amazing. I know fried chicken and waffles seem like an odd combination but it's really interesting and satisfying - with the syrup and hot sauce for the chicken.... Yum Yum.  It's one of my family's favorites!!!  TRY IT!!!!~~#~1
The Roaring Fork is one of my very favorite restaurants.  I am not a big fan of the environment, particularly the patio and back rooms, but the food more than makes up for it.  The pork green chili served with warm tortillas is dreamy.  I also adore the huckleberry margaritas.  Can't go wrong.~~#~1
This place sucks!! I moved to the valley and have yet to find that "go to " chinese spot, sooo I decided to give this spot a try. I called my order in and was assured by the employee that all the food is cooked to order, always fresh. So I picked up my food, and what do you know, I got some old azz fried rice with some microwaved shrimp. WTF??!! I give this place 2 thumbs down and I would not eat here if I was hungry as a hostage :(~~#~0
I really hate to do this.  This restaurant is fit for those that think Taco Bell is a great place for Mexican food.The buffet was pathetic and contained maybe 12 items (no white rice).  My sampling of their offerings ranged from terrible to mediocre.  China Garden has, hands down, the worst eggroll I've eaten.Given the atmosphere of the place it was plain to see China Garden had regulars.  One guy at the cashier even commented that he'd been coming since 1970.  I don't get it.  This is the worst restaurant I have ever dined at.The staff and whom I presumed to be the owner/manager was nice and friendly but that cannot make up for the poor quality of selection and food.~~#~0
After a long week of being trapped in a conference room, I really really needed to be outside.  Pinnacle Peak helped to put me back in my normal happy place.This spot is very popular and can get really crowded on weekends.  I wanted to enjoy a little bit of solitude, so I arrived as the sun was rising.  Good choice - there were only a few others around on this chilly morning.The 3+ mile trail is an out-and-back route, with enough ups and downs to keep it interesting.  Like a stairmaster, but better because you aren't in a gym squished next to some icky sweaty person.  The well-maintained path is packed gravel, so you can spend more time enjoying the beautiful views rather focusing on where you are stepping.For those that want to take their time and learn a little, there are small signs along the route that label various plants, as well as two rest points with markers to tell you the names of the mountains you can see in the distance.  Get up!  Go outside!  You will love it as much as I do.~~#~1
Love it and love the GF menu.  It's amazing how many dishes they have~~#~1
Excellent service and great quality.  I will always bring my alterations here.  Had an emergency and needed a hem done in a couple of hours and they had it sone sooner than expected!~~#~1
Cary is one of the most honest and knowledgeable mechanics I've ever been to. He is caring to all of his customer's and his shop takes the utmost care with the cars they work on. I cannot recommend him strongly enough!~~#~1
The interior is very industrial and charming; furnished with iron beams, brick walls and simple hanging lightbulbs. The lobby area has special imported drinks and other trinkets. There is always a line but it usually goes pretty quick because you're distracted by all of their deserts and miscellaneous goodies on display. I've never had a meal that wasn't awesome here. I usually find myself eating the simple but delicious Liberty Joe with their special spicy sauce and then finishing the meal off with a home-made snicker-doodle. Whatever you end up ordering, I'm sure you'll end up enjoying Liberty Market as greatly and as frequently as I do!~~#~1
I love happy hour!  3PM to 6PM EVERYDAY! This place has one of, if not, THE BEST!!! $4 Grilled Chicken Quesadillas, YES!!  Plus $4 or $5 for a mile high pile of Green Chile  Chicken Nachos?  YES!!!  And if you really want a treat...$9 for 3 huge fillet Mignon Tacos.  Plus COLD BEER both bottle and tap plus reasonable mixed drink prices.  Place is friendly, bar plays classic rock, most patrons seem to be regulars...once you eat there, you will be too!  Friendly staff especially Hostess Judith and the young man with the red hair.  I've been in the restaurant  related business for 30 years, the prime phrase is CONSISTANCY and the food, atmosphere and friendly people are always consistant.  Consistantly great.  The owner, Andrew, always makes a point to great everybody.  New Orleans Bartender exudes Southern Hospitality.  Regular Menu is a bit pricey, portions could be larger, but food is great.~~#~1
We went here for a family dinner.  Our family is loud and boisterous but not obnoxious.  We asked to be seated in the bar since some of us wanted to watch the game.  No problems so far.Our waiter was really nice at first, but seemed flustered and as if he wasn't getting the help he needed to keep up with his tables.  I waited tables for 12 years and this guy was nearly literally scrambling to keep up, a sure sign of not enough help or lack of teamwork.  Of the two hostesses, ONE of them could have bothered to help him out by refilling water, tea and soda for us, but alas they did nothing.  We waited so long for drink refills that my husband got up and saw a pitcher of coke on the bar, so he poured himself a glass, which he was scolded for!  I could not believe it, I was shocked.  A guest should NEVER be treated this way.  If anything, someone should have apologized to my husband for not giving us what we needed for the meal. The chips were good, and they kept them coming, so props to them for that.  They are served with bean dip and salsa.  I liked the salsa a lot, not spicy enough for me, but a good amount and mixture of yummy stuff, including cilantro which I find many "salsas" don't even contain!  To me, it is not salsa without cilantro.  The teensy bowls of salsa they bring though need some rethinking.  They should either bring one per person or consider a bigger size.  It's only about 2 Tablespoons, and that aint much salsa (beware, some sides of rice and beans also come in these super tiny containers - three or four bites and it's gone)!  Anyhow, we ate tons of chips and salsa because the food took SO long to come out.  Our waiter sort of apologized for this by keeping us updated that it was actually coming.....someday.Our food came out a good 35-40 minutes after we ordered.  Sadly, two meals were completely missing in action and the two of us that ordered fajitas (which came out of the kitchen very cool, not even the slightest bit of heat from the iron skillet or the meat) had to wait at least 10 minutes for their tortillas, so they couldn't even eat what was at the table, which was getting cold.  After the two missing meals came out, one was the wrong meat, red meat instead of chicken.  More waiting...the table eats, minus one.  When everyone is nearly finished, the right chicken taco dish comes out.  It was delicious, but overpriced.  The chicken was nicely grilled and the tacos were served the way I like them, with a little bit of onions, more cilantro, lettuce, lime and pico de gallo.  They also came with cheese, but I don't like cheese on tacos.  They came on tiny little corn tortillas, which themselves were good, but way too small to make decent tacos that didn't fall apart.  Plus, I ran out of  the tortillas before my meat and other stuff was gone.Our waiter was really nice except for the scolding (I'm still floored by that), so I can't decide if he sucked or the place sucks, or maybe they both do...We definately won't be back.~~#~0
Recently I had the pleasure of eating at this great new Iron Chef Jose Garces restaurant. Pulling up to the front entrance to the restaurant my girlfriend and I were greeted by extremely nice doorman who valet our vehicle for us. We were a bit concerned that we were going to get wet from the rain on this day, but thanks to the valet service the hotel & restaurant provide we stayed warm and dry! Now I must say we were taken back from the decor inside the restaurant... It was spectacular!! The way the restaurant is decorated just puts a smile on your face! Also, it gives you a feel for Iron Chef Jose Garces personality which seems to be light and fun. The food is absolutely amazing!! We split the "IGNACIO" Nachos which have black beans, tomato, queso mixto, jalapeño, chile de arbol, and radish, and the Barbbacoa "Costillas" berkshire pork spare ribs, chipotle-cider mustard bbq they were tender, juicy, and delicious! We tried the House Margarita the "Distrito" and the white "Mexican Sangria" both were spectacular!! I have never heard of a white sangria before.. But WOW it was amazing! All of the employees we encountered were extremely nice, knowledgeable, and sincere. This restaurant will definitely stay on my regular to do list! Thanks to everyone who gave us a wonderful experience!!!~~#~1
Amazing greek food! Definitely try the greek fries!  I always try to come here every time I am in Phoenix.  Staff is also always very friendly!Also try the greek calamari.  Unusually delicious!~~#~1
Awesome, Big Ben sandwich is delish and chocolate/strawberry scones is one of the best I have ever had, and can't forget to mention the coffee and tea, great place~~#~1
The food was okay but the portion sizes where the smallest I have ever seen....and I am a regular to fox restaurants.  Babbo is much better.~~#~0
Food: great!  Service: Excellent!  I had the Frank Sinatra Calzone (you choose 3 items for the filling...I suggest what I had: sausage, pepperoni, and meatball).  It was just like being back in New York.  Loaded with Ricotta, too...They don't skimp here.  The server was great too...Didn't catch his name, but he's a burly, bald headed guy with a beard.  Very friendly, polite, attentive.  Cool to look in the kitchen and see the pizzas being hand tossed...Wonder if the cook thinks I was looking at him...Well, I actually was, but only because he really got into tossing the pizzas and was entertaining to watch.Go there.  Eat everything.  Tip big!~~#~1
I was so, so hopeful.  October in Scottsdale, yummy, tacos.....Wow!  Rip Off!! $10 Just to get in (what was that for?). No shade unless you were buying a drink.  Most places wouldn't give you salsa or taco sauce with your measly over priced taco. They seemed like the vultures who didn't care about the customer, just the $2 ticket they could grab from you.  I had to beg for a napkin then hunt for a place to sit feeling watched by the other vultures waiting for me to get up.I was ready to leave after 45 minutes and my Pepsi had gotten warm, so I had gotten a cup of ice from the bar.   I poured it in, took one drink and as I was leaving to hike back to my car, security stopped me and would n't let me take it out! "It could have booze in it".  Well, by then, I was one angry little local. Dumped it all in trash and said to my sweet daughter in law who was about to "go mad" with me, "Get me outta here!". She had brought her 2 year old, thinking what a fun way to spend a Saturday morning and encourage our local businesses.  Nope.  Not good.~~#~0
What happened to this place?  The first time I went about a year ago, both the food and service were great.Second time, last May, I ordered the same dish and it was horrible.  Drowning in sauce.  But, at least the service was decent.Just went a third time and it will be my last.  Both the food and service were horrible.  Went for lunch, sat inside and it wasn't very busy.  Our waiter was totally out of it and only had 4 tables and hardly paid any attention to us and kept forgetting things, like taking our order to start.  Then, even the food runner forgot to bring me half my meal after I asked her for it.  In the meantime, I counted at least 17 staff member hanging out in the kitchen area, which is open, so you can see them and half of them were folding napkins.My food was not very good and actually made me a little sick.  This is a shame, especially because there aren't many places in Phx that have vegan choices, but for the price you pay, I would expect a lot more.~~#~0
I love that this restaurant can accommodate  all types of people. It's a sports bar with Family style entertainment! The staff is always friendly and  they aim to please. The food is always good and prices are very reasonable. The bar is on one side so it splits the Families with children on the other side with an amazing area with tvs to play Xbox and wii. Check this place out. You won't be disappointed.~~#~1
Honestly I don't get it.  I went to Dos Gringos with a good friend of mine last weekend.  I had never been to Phoenix before so I was excited to see what the city had to offer.  After entering Dos Gringos we sat at our table for 21 minutes before a waitress came to our table.  She brought us 2 beers and never came back. After 40 minutes we decided to check out a new bar since we obviously weren't welcomed at Dos Gringos.  So we went up to the bar where I waited for 5 minutes so the bartender could take some pictures and shots with her friends.  What I didn't understand was there were maybe only 20 people there and at least 6 people working.  If I was the owner or manager I would be embarrassed to say that you run that establishment.  I will never return and I highly recommend you stay away from Dos Gringos as you will be disappointed.~~#~0
I had an amazing dinner tonight at Quiessence.  When we made the reservation they asked if we were celebrating anything; we were, so when we sat down we were given 3 glasses of complimentary champagne.  We started with a plate of three delicious cheeses.  They have a huge selection of cheeses, probably about 20, and we chose a goat, a smoked gouda and a jack.  All delicious and served with crostini, perfectly melt-in-your-mouth bartlett pears, pecans, honey and quince paste.  Great start.Our next course we shared two salads - an octopus carpaccio and field green salad.  Both good.My main course was AMAZING.  It was heritage turkey with mashed potatoes and carrots.  I ate every bite.  SO flavorful.  My dad had a beef sirloin that was perfectly cooked and delicious with a side of fingerling potatoes.  My mom got swordfish.  It was not cooked properly when it first came out, but they promptly corrected the problem, so i can't fault them for that.The ambience was great including a live but not distracting singer and a warm crackling fireplace.  In addition, I want to give big props to the servers for knowing everything about the food they served.  She knew where the fish was caught, how the beef was raised, what certifications the turkey farm had achieved.  It is great to be able to get those kind of answers with zero attitude when you ask the question.My only reservations would be 1) definitely is "slow" food, maybe a tad too slow but so delicious it was worth it and they said they were short staffed and 2) i'm not sure i buy that their seafood is sustainable.  They served atlantic cod and atlantic swordfish.  My understanding is that both of these fish stocks are pretty severely depleted.  I asked and was told that the fisherman they buy from are committed to sustainable methods, but I'm not sure (personally, for me, at least) that it is possible to sustainably fish a stock that is in danger.All in all though, a fantastic night and i can't wait to return!~~#~1
My wife and I absolutely love this place.  Yes, it's a bit pricier... but yu get what you pay for: excellent food and service!  The patio is even cigar-friendly, which is a huge plus for us!  We visit often!~~#~1
Ok..I told Amanda that anyplace that serves beer would have a tough time getting less than 2 stars from me...I wish there were 1.5 however. As covered by Amanda this bar is about as straight as they come..this bar personified would probably call bars with any hippness at all the bad F word for gay folk. In fact this bar would most certainly over-use that word. Does Puddle of Mudd, Disturbed and POD know that their songs are available in karaoke form? Do they make money from them? Who was the first person to say damn man I can not wait to scream this song to the MIDI music only version over some beers this weekend.I had a good time...but I tend to make the best of things. There was far more facial hair than head hair. I hate phonetic spellings.. Oh lord don't ever make me go back....eff it...I changed my mind. 1.2 stars and I am rounding down.~~#~0
Lets just say i was not to please with my experience at Nails R Us. After two days my nails were lifting on about 4 nails by the end of the weekend i had 6 nails lifting, so i went back and showed them and she was like its normal. No it normal to lift but not after 2 days! They did fix them for me free of charge but were very rude to me!!! Will not be going back there or will not refer any of my friends there!~~#~0

Along with Bliss, FEZ is another one of my fav brunch spots. They have $3 specialty drinks (mimosas, bloody marys, bellinis...). The service is always quick and the servers are always attentive and very patient with my ridiculous modifications. They have a drink called a "g-spot" and it is fresh grapefruit, grapefruit juice, ruby red vodka and soda. It is unbelievable and on thursdays they are $3 (i think) The menu is different with kasras and stylish burgers but somehow we always fill up on the appetizers. The cheese fondue and the little pyllo pockets are my favs. Ive never been disappointed at FEZ and I absolutely will continue to recommend it and go back! (Thanks thomas for the corrections!)~~#~1
i love trader joe's!!! i think they're selection of products are just GREAT!!! i can't get enough of it.the place is clean and the people are friendly. it's right next to michaels which is also great. it's in a convenient place. it seems like the people there are nutty-crunchy which i love!!~~#~1
Attended the Table 12 Lunch & Learn event with guest Chef Mel Mecinas and was truly blown away.  I have previously eaten off of the house menu, so was expecting just as spectacular presentation as Chef Beau Macmillan presents - I was not disappointed.Our party started the night at Jade, which I have written a review for previously.  Great place, wont go into much detail there.The meal started with with an entree of a rare tuna, bacon, asparagus, and hollandaise sauce.  Second course was Korean short ribs, brussel spouts, and lotus root kimchi.  For dessert, twas a bourbon banana creme with carmel popcorn and candied walnuts.The meal could not have been more amazing, and the service was just as good.  Have already booked the event on Aug 18.~~#~1
I've often driven by here, & figured I'd go in & take a look sometime. But I was looking for a clock-mini-speaker system that I use with my iPhone 4.  When I had my 3G, I had a very bad experience where I was assured that a particular clock-mini-speakers I bought would work with it - but all it had was a cheap plastic adapter that the 3G kept falling out of - & then they gave me a hard time about a refund.This time, I was again getting either glib reassurances & non-specific information, "sorry out of stock"s, or  NO OPEN floor samples I could look at, at 3 other stores (including the big A Store with a lot of Jobs), not to mention conflicting info on Amazon & upon Googling.  So I thought to go into the iStore. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised! They had open, plugged in items that I could actually test my iPhone 4 in to make sure it worked. Even better, I began chatting with the guys there about various other iPhone &  MacBook Pro issues, & found they had FAR more knowledge about BOTH the phone & it's peripherals and MacBook Pro's (and HONESTY about them) than I ever got from the "really-really-smart" folks at the Big-A-Store-with-Jobs who will promise you anything. So, I would definitely go back there for honest advice & I would certainly bring in anything that needed warranty service.  They also have a pretty nice selection of peripherals and better yet, they know WHAT WORKS WITH WHAT!~~#~1
As far as gourmet burger joints go, this place is the bomb! I am a huge fan of Deluxe Burger and now they have a run for their money! Plus the parking is much easier at Zinburger. I had the Zinburger, and we shared sweet potato fries and regular fries. Everything was delicious! All 3 of had the Zinburger, so not much variety at our table, but we all finished our burgers, and given the size of them, I was pretty surprised/impressed with all of us. The burger was heavenly, juicy and cooked perfectly. I would definitely go back, again and again!~~#~1
I work across the street and love me some Hava Java. The morning crew is very friendly, and the coffee is great. I am a big fan of the Swiss chocolate blend, (or any of the flavored blends for that matter!) they are really flavorful without tasting at all artificial. I buy Hava Java beans and brew them at home, but when I stop in for a quick cup of coffee I always have a good experience.~~#~1
This is the largest urban park. Moreover, that urban part is great because I am 10-30 minutes from three major trailhead areas. For hiking I like many points of entry, one of my favorites is telegraph pass, this is on the south side of the mountain. A new recently remolded parking lot is found on desert foothills parkway. There is a paved path that is about 1/2 a mile and at its end Telegraph pass is to the left and Desert classic is to the right.Telegraph pass grows in steepness towards the top where there are some larger stairs. At the top, there is a bench and you can then continue on National trail. If you head west, you can reach a great Ramada.From the pima canyon entrance I take the fire road to national, after the initial ascent it is just some rolling hills, I then make left to hidden valley where there is a great natural tunnel, Follow this trail to reach fat man's pass, contrary to the name there is a narrow gap that fat men cannot pass luckily you can go around, this meets back up with national trail. Many unique rock formations on this hike. For shorter easier hikes from this lot, you can do the east and west loops and Beverly canyon all small trails that loop, and have a few nice views.For Mountain biking my skills are not too advanced so I stick to the east end of desert classic, with mostly straight section and a few wash passes and slight hill inclines it's great for a novice rider.~~#~1
They get five stars now. You know why? Three little words I long to hear: Gluten-Free Buns! (OK, technically that's two words, but I love them nonetheless!)The buns are a dollar extra, but if you are like me and are tired of eating a burger with a lettuce wrap, or worse, with cutlery, just for the illusion of a sense of normalcy, they are worth it. And, frankly, quite tasty.I don't know if all RR are serving them now, or from the same bakeries/distributors, but I for one am glad for it!~~#~1
A most unexpected gem! If you are a wine drinker, fabulous flights! Great selection! I can't say much more other than... AWESOME!~~#~1
I live in the townhomes right next to this restaurant and it still took me 4-5 months to actually try it. Absolute blasphemy as I see it now. This is a charming little place, decor outdated enough that it's sweet again, friendly servers, and man, great food. The pesto cream sauce ravioli (I believe) will blow you away. The wine glasses are filled high. Everything is great quality. Prices are medium-range, most dishes ranging from $11-18 but coming with a salad or soup and bread. This would be a great, great date night spot.~~#~1
I put forth that we need to institute a new standard of measurement to be used for comparing coffee shops.  Furthermore, I think that Cartel Coffee Labs should use this place as a standard for this new unit of measurement.I have to assume it's called a "Coffee Lab" for a reason.  Too many coffee shops these days are retail stores, where coffee is an incidental thing in all the yelling, stupid names, and fancy colors.  If you look at the menu of Cartel Coffee Lab, there are a total of 13 items.  It's all about the coffee, plain and simple.Then again, there's really nothing simple about it to those who take their coffee as seriously as this place does.  The artistry of their baristas is not to be trifled with.  These people can make a latte so pretty, you really won't want to drink it (until you do, then you're happy you did).  On top of that, the selection of coffee varietals is impressive.  I've only tried one, but that alone was better than anything Starbucks tries to pawn off on the masses.  Perhaps the use of the term "Lab" is because they've actually stepped beyond anything any other coffee shop has done.  Either way, the formula that they came up with works better than anything I've come across before.Then again, maybe I'm being too hard on the other places.  It's not that they have an intrinsically inferior product, but the reason for these places has been lost behind t shirts and mugs and open mic nights and selling you a card containing the same money you'd use on the place anyway...I digress.  Cartel Coffee Labs is a great place with a fantastic product.  If their WiFi is weak or the back corner gets dark, I honestly don't care.  Their coffee is excellent and I'll be coming back for more.~~#~1
First time having Scandinavian food, everything was excellent. Will return soon.~~#~1
This place is great!If you talk to anybody they have a suggestion for a great flavor.You can bring in food from another place to enjoy and just enjoy a great atmosphere.With the music that someone has an issue with you can just talk to the DJ to get a suggestion they are MORE than accommodating.They have a great happy hour prices! Overall great prices, great people, and a great time! If you have the right mind :)~~#~1
This is definitely the best Indian restaurant in Phoenix. The tandoori chicken and aloo tikki wraps are to die for. You cannot go wrong with this place!~~#~1
In 1999, I was discharged from the United States Marine Corps.Keeping a high and tight well maintained was a real pain in the ass because barbers dont understand what the hell its supposed to be like.  I am sure that many of you who keep this style of haircut understand.Any barber can sit you in a chair and cut your hair.  This guy used a razor to get skin close on the sides, and a leveler (no, I am not kidding) to make sure that the cut was even.I have gone to at least 20 barber shops in the Phoenix, Mesa, and Tempe area.  This barber shop beats them all.This is the BEST barber shop in Phoenix.  I have been a repeat customer for 9 years, and I will keep going back until they close up shop.~~#~1
Tweet tweet.  I decided to follow Market Bistro on Twitter just recently and am sure glad I did.  This company really knows how to treat their 'followers'. I have been a fan of Market Bistro for 2 years now, they have such a comfortable setting at both locations and the food is impeccable not to mention reasonably priced.I have always opted for the Market pizza, a dish that includes artichokes, large sundried tomatoes and a flat parmesean encrusted dough.  There hasn't been one time that I've visited Market and felt disappointed in portion size or my order.  I have such an appreciation for an establishment that takes pride in their food's ingredients, atmosphere and customer service methods.As for salads,  If you can take the 'heat' I would absolutely recommend the Arizona Salad.  The chipotle dressing, black beans, rice and tortilla crisps are a terrific blend of taste for your palette.  You will feel right at home here in the southwest with each and every bite.If you haven't already started your car or phoned in your order at Market, I'm 100% sure you are crazy.#BRAVO  (hashtagging seems appropriate here).~~#~1
These little sliders are tasty, delicious and pretty speedy.  You get two and you can get them with or without grilled onions.  There is a home made type thousand island dressing on them that adds so much to these wonderous burgers!   Fries are 5 star as well...also enjoy the people watching...Scottsdale at its finest!~~#~1
One word to describe this hotel: quality. The pools were all warm and unique. The hotel has two hot tubs, one that changes colors at night and is next to a man made stream, the other is on its own "island". There are two pools, a lazy river, and a small pool. The rooms were comfortable and the whole facility was clean. One thing that must be commented on is the staff was not only efficient but they were very friendly and nice. All of the food and room service I ordered was filled with superb flavor and had good presentation. The hotel also has a botanical garden, herb garden, multiple lawns, and it contains different food services. I highly recommend the ranchero pulled pork tacos and the sushi. The Marriott burger, creme  brûlée, drinks, and fromage board was very good.~~#~1
As good as all the others, and closer to home than most.~~#~1
The service here was awful, we waited patiently for over 15 minutes for our server to come by our table. Finally a hostess came by and noticed nobody was helping us and got us drinks. Another 15 minutes roll by and finally our server decides to make an appearance saying "have you guys decided yet on what you want?", uhh yeah!Overall, service was poor and food was just okay. Won't be going back.~~#~0
Good place to chill with a drink somewhere lowly lit and good live music. All the bartenders are really nice and that's always RAD:)~~#~1
Panda Garden is a family run Chinese Food Restaurant that is always friendly, and most importantly, delicious. You can order dishes family style and there's plenty of delicious meals to try. My personal favorite is the Empress Chicken, sweeter then Orange Chicken, but the flavor just melts in your mouth. I just had the Kung Pao Two which is Chicken and Shrimp, and its even better the next day as leftovers thanks to the generous portions. They have a good selection of sake and beer as well. This is my favorite Chinese restaurant and hope everyone else checks it out.~~#~1
Closed on Sunday?  Looks like you've not only lost my Sunday dollars, but my business on Monday through Saturday too.~~#~0
Beautiful hotel, great pool, nice restaurants, fantastic service, fabulous place to stay.~~#~1
*CASH AND CHECKS ONLY**OPEN 9 AM, 7 DAYS A WEEK*Love this place. Took my daughter here a year ago to get her very FIRST haircut. We had Miss Tara, who provided us with a "first haircut" certificate and she also had these tiny quarter-size ziploc bags for my daughter's very first strand of hair that she cut. The haircut was $15. Along with the haircut, Miss Tara styled it and put clips and glitter in her hair. My daughter LOVED it. The place itself was kid-friendly. There's a little kitchen for the kids to play with while waiting for their haircut. There are 3 big kid chairs for older kids to get their haircut. And there are 2 car-styled chairs for the younger kids. I took my daughter for her SECOND haircut today. We had Miss Annette. She was great. Again, my daughter got her hair styled after her haircut and got glitter and flowers put into her hair. The haircut was $15. We also got a punchcard, where you're 9th haircut will be free. This place does walk-ins, but it is better to call and schedule an appointment since they don't have a specific opening/closing time. They take CASH ONLY so keep that in mind.~~#~1
Amazing bagels and a great staff. I always get the build your bagel sandwich it's heaven!~~#~1
This was such a good experienceI was up all night with a extremely severe painful tooth acheI don't have health insurance so I didn't think I could afford a dentistFriends and Family told me to look up a dental school and thats how I found A.T. StillI called and they said they accept five Emergency patients a day at 1:pmIt was 11am but I didn't care I drove straight there and I was the first patient seen at 1p.m.it cost $15 to be seen, $15 for the X-Rays, and turns out my wisdom tooth was infected and had a cavityso they sent me up to oral surgery, it cost me $85 to get the tooth extractedi was nervous and they talked me through it and calmed my fearsIt didn't hurt at all, I was numbed up and the student did a good jobthey gave me a three prescriptions to take with me and I have to return next week for follow - upthe follow up appointment is FREE!totally recommend this place to any and everyone!~~#~1
Is there a way I can give LUSH an extra star???Pros: Friendly & enthusiastic staff, incredible products, lots of samples, phenomenal smells, reasonable prices, and get this, an HONEST company!!! Read their bag, it'll make you love them more.Cons: if you're sensitive to smells, brace yourself.  Also, if you're the type that wants to be left alone while you shop, beware.  The staff is excited about their products.Don't miss: R&B hair moisturizer (it drives men crazy!), Coalface facial cleanser & Brazen Honey exfoliating mask.~~#~1
this place is so darn cute!  You might miss it if you are driving too fast.  The food is like nothing I have ever experienced.  I had the pot pie, mmmm was that tasty.  All of the chicken and veggies are wrapped up in a pie type crust with the gravy on the side for dipping.  I have never enjoyed a pot pie as much as this one.  The only thing that was slightly off, was the lighting is very dark and the portions are small.  With that said, the portions being small left us room for dessert.  The dessert was out of this world!  You cannot go wrong with any of their items on the menu! I will be back for lunch for sure, and will bring visitors to this location too!~~#~1
2nd time messing up our carry out order. Boneless wings have bones and no carrots or celery again!!  Hamburger with only tomato, cheese, and BBQ sauce had onions and lettuce, when we specifically said no lettuce or onion. Allergic to onions and don't like shredded lettuce. Thanks to Tiler for messing up our order again. Will not be back.~~#~0
I absolutely love the food here!  The sushi and Walnut Shrimp are cravings that I must give in to.  This is a nice, small restaurant that is exceptionally clean and comfortable. Good for a casual date, lunch any day (their specials are a great deal), and the owner managers are on site most hours they are open. You have to try the Walnut Shrimp!~~#~1
Even for meat eaters, Green has a lot to love. A lot more than just tofu! I go here at least a couple times a month for lunch and it's spectacular 95% of the time. A few of our favorite items are the BBQ "Chicken" sandwich, Thee Argentine sandwich, the crab puffs and of course, the Tsoynamis. Everything is fairly priced ($8 for a sandwich, $7.50 for a bowl w/ your choice or rice or noodles). The only thing I don't particularly care for is the buffalo wings as I think they are far too salty. The ranch that it comes with is fantastic, though. Also, if you get something with cheese make sure to use Daiya instead of Teese. Daiya tastes much better, in my opinion.The atmosphere is very artsy. There are always paintings for sale and there are a bunch of old car doors and hub caps over to one side. They just got a few booths which is fantastic if you want a little privacy. There is free wifi, a booshelf will all sorts of great reading, and the staff is always super friendly.Another great thing about Green is the vegan market. They have all sorts of great vegan foods and books for you to spoil yourself with. It's the only place I know of where you can find Teese, Food for Lovers Queso and Soy Curls. As an aside, I highly recommend Soy Curls as a healthy replacement to the meat in your fajitas or cheesesteaks.Another thing you absolutely must check out is their annual ThanksLIVING festival on Thanksgiving. They will load you up will all sorts of delicious and traditional Thankgsiving day food, veganized. "Turkey", stuffing, biscuits, brussels sprouts, asparagus, cranberry sauce, gravy, corn, pie and a drink. You'll get guest speakers, live music and local arts and crafts. Highly recommend.~~#~1
Burger was delicious and fresh. Fries were well seasoned and crispy. Huge selection of bottled sodas from across the nation. Fun and good! Definitely coming back.~~#~1
Neighbors had told me how great this place is and after reading the positive YELP reviews, I decided to have dinner here with my family!Friendly greeting and service from the moment we walked in the door! Fast service and great food too!HUGE portions!! I recommend splitting entree's. We ordered 2 entree's between 3 people and had 2 boxes of leftovers we took home! I split the lamb kabobs and the meat was tender and juicy. Hubby had the Gyro's and loved them! (Gyro's were probably enough food for 3 people!!).Moderate prices. Averaging about $15 bucks a plate, but the dinner plates come with the amazing Basmati rice with white currants, almonds and maybe a touch of cinnamon?I was told they had the best cannoli's in town.....so I had to save room for one!!...and they were pretty darn good!! To sum it up...... FAST~FRIENDLY~FRESH FOOD!!!Yummy!!~~#~1
I just went here for the first time with my boyfriend this afternoon. I got a Green Apple Snow and he got a Mocha... Blast? or something like that. We both loved them. While the drink was amazing, what was even better was the quality of their boba, they weren't too hard or squishy and they had the perfect taste. The shop was really clean and nice and cool. I also noticed they had battleship and I think checkers and some other board games out for customers to play with. They also had a computer monitor I am guessing for games. I didn't go to look at it. I think there was music on but I can't remember.The service was really fast, but then we were the only ones there. You can't use a debit/credit card for an order under $10 so we ordered an extra drink for our friend we were going to visit. We asked if she could make it when we were ready to leave and she was really nice about it. I can't say one bad thing about it. If I find something else on another visit I will update. As of now this is going to be my number one place to get boba.~~#~1
Recently moved from the East Coast. So glad Yelp introduced us to Il Bosco. I highly recommend the Biaggia pizza. It's amazing. Great food and great hospitality from this small little spot.~~#~1
If you are looking for a place where the service matches the food, look no further. This family style Americanized-Italian restaurant was beyond comparison. The staff is very friendly and if you have children, they will well entertained while stuffing their faces with amazing food. From the freshly baked bread to the main coarse, every bite was like a new adventure for my taste buds. They have a wide variety of food but I highly recommend the pasta dishes. Your mouth will thank you the moment you take your first bite.~~#~1
So, after finding out I didn't have to be a juror today, I decided to go to Treehouse to celebrate!  I got 12 different cupcakes (intending to share with my husband and friends at work of course!) and wasn't disappointed. I love the caramel chocolate and peanut butter chocolate ones best! The only ingredient I hope Treehouse considers adding is avocado, since it makes vegan cupcakes decadently rich!  One of the sister's who co-owns and is a co-baker was a doll. We both are hoping Phoenix continues to build up a variety of veggie- conscientious, healthy/delicious places to frequent.~~#~1
I called The Town Dump to ask if I could come in this week and interview them for an English paper about a small local business, and the owner was just incredibly rude. She didn't even let me finish telling her it would take five minutes of her time, preferring to interject and tell me to go somewhere else. When I explained that I've heard wonderful things about their business from friends, and that that sparked my interest, she said, "Well, go somewhere else."I've never even been inside, and I sure as hell won't go now. Maybe it's just me, but I don't like shopkeepers who snarl at their customers.~~#~0
I've eatin' a lot of pizza and can say without worries that Mama Mia's is the Best I've had -- Consistency, value and great service sets them apart -- They also have the best take out wings in town!!!!~~#~1
Matt's Big Breakfast is a wonderful place in the morning to feel the life of downtown Phoenix.  I have eaten there 5 times in the last year and each meal was worth the 10 to 20 minute wait out side on the sidewalk.  At 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, July 3, my wife Marie and I ventured downtown and decided to have breakfast out.  Matt's was on our mind.  We waited outside only 5 minutes before getting a table by the window next to the kitchen entry.  Busy place, but the service was great.  Quick with the coffee for Marie and ice tea for me.  Marie ordered an omelet with cheese and mushrooms, while I decided on the special, eggs benedict.  We both had the home fries. When everything arrived, the meal was very yummy.  Marie, in her delicate way, snarfed down her omelet with a smile.  My eggs benedict was on a fresh English muffin, topped with ham, poached eggs, and a yummy hollandaise sauce.  Calories be damned!The whole meal cost $22.53 + 4.00 tip.Yes the place is small and you'll most likely have a short wait for a table, but get over that, because the experience of eating good food prepared by great people is worth your time.~~#~1
The message I received was drip is toast. I don't drink coffee... a terrible character fault, I know... but Gina and her partner are wonderful hosts and have made a cozy little space to serve delicious food and drinks (I get the chai tea with soy milk.) I like that computers are no where to be seen, only happy people eating and drinking and enjoying conversation. This is a lovely little place, a gem. I enjoy every visit. It is especially nice to bring new people in that haven't been before (so invite a friend to brunch because it is a nice surprise.) The service is great, the food is made fresh, and everything I've tried is delicious, even my five year old loved her nutella on toast. Good things come in small packages and toast illustrates this perfectly.~~#~1
I recently tried vietnamese food, maybe 3 years ago.  I especially like the pho soup and spring rolls.  Since then, I have been trying every place I can that serves pho.  Out of every place that I have been so far, this place is always the one I come back to.  It's a little hole in the wall type place.  The kind you would drive by and never even notice if you weren't looking for it.  The pho has some of the best tasting broth and is a good portion.  It's about average price if not closer to the cheapest I have found.  It comes with a good sized plate of sprouts, basil, mint, lime, and jalapeno.  The spring rolls that I get have pork and shrimp in them and are a pretty good size.  The peanut sauce that comes with them for dipping tastes almost like fresh made peanut butter and has fresh ground pieces of peanut in it.  The service is fairly quick and very friendly, even with the fact that there is some language barrier.  I was actually taken to this place for the first time by an ex-coworker of mine who is an old vietnamese guy.  He told me himself that this is probably the best place he has found to eat pho at, and based on the fact that it is usually packed with asian people during lunch time, I am very inclined to believe him.~~#~1
With a few hours past and a few tasks accomplished the next stop of my day would be at Pane Bianco - the sandwich shop from the Valley's most celebrated Chef, Chris Bianco.  Having made my pilgrimage to the eponymous pizzeria during my first trip to Phoenix, Pane had been on my radar since the day I moved to town but given the lunch-only hours and my office location in North Scottsdale I knew a weekend would be best and as luck would have it a new website (http://www.pizzeriabianco.com/) and seven day 11a-3p schedule had been rolled out just the week prior.Arriving at the surprisingly large space (especially when compared to Matt's and JoBot from earlier that day - and compared to Pizzeria Bianco as well) shortly after 11:30 and allocating parking in the free lot juxtaposing the Light Rail I debated for a moment whether dine-in or to-go was best and opting for the former made my way into the restaurant where two couples already sat.  Greeted by one of two servers it was suggested I could take "any seat I wanted" and opting for a bench in the center of the room where a menu awaited I sat down to browse the menu as well as the daily specials listed on the chalkboard - almost all sounding appealing, but a bit different than the Saturday special listed on the website.  With a small list of beverages available I was asked soon if I was ready to order or if I needed a few minutes I deferred and requested a glass of water that would never reach even half-empty despite me drinking from it consistently and the restaurant soon filling to capacity.Having debated the specials but eventually undeterred from the reason I'd come in the first place I soon placed my order for a sandwich and an 'appetizer' which I was told would be 'just a few minutes' and as while I waited I checked out the small market at the Take Away section featuring the famous focaccia, cans of tomatoes, dried pasta, and apparel before returning to my seat where my items would arrive shortly - the first a Manchego and Tomato Sauce Focaccia del Giorno featuring Bianco's delectable wood fired focaccia in all of its spongy glory topped with sweet, ripe tomatoes and an ample layer of briny Manchego; at $4.50 probably the most expensive "Grandma Slice" I've ever had yet at the same time also probably the best...or at least on par with that at DiFara in Brooklyn for best of its genre.Moving next to the original target of my desire, a sandwich of Bianco's House Made Mozzarella, Tomatoes, and Basil on Wood Fired Focaccia my first thought was "wow - that is a lot of cheese" while my second, after a bite, was "wow - that is a lot of flavor."  Perhaps as pure of a sandwich as you can find and the result of exquisite ingredients on top quality bread there is really nothing 'special' about the composition of this sandwich aside from the fact that it simply works - a largely unmanipulated masterpiece only improved by a touch of sea salt and cracked black pepper.Largely unaware on entering that Pane serves dessert it was with much delight that I realized soon after sitting down that three options were available that day and while the flourless chocolate cake I saw emerge from the kitchen to the table next to me looked quite nice there was simply no way I was passing up the Organic Vanilla Bean Rice Pudding with Candied Pecans - another simplistic stunner with creamy Arborio rice imbued with a rich vanilla custard flicked with whole vanilla beans and a few pecans for crunch.  Delicate and smooth, flavorful without being overly sweet, and *almost* thick enough to stand a spoon up straight it was not quite the best rice pudding I've ever had - but a top five contender without a shadow of a doubt - a reason in and of itself to return to Pane Bianco...though to be fair, if I returned it would take pretty spectacular daily specials to prevent me from ordering the exact same trio of items once again.  With Chris and his team now two for two it is only a matter of time before I make my way to Italian Restaurant... and honestly, that time is likely measured in hours and days as opposed to weeks and months.~~#~1
I loved this place! A bit pricey, but excellent quality.Been here twice and haven't had anything we didn't like. The meat is great quality and they'll cook it how you desire as opposed to places that won't cook something below medium well.Great toppings for burgers, fries and shakes. Although everything is so big and filling I certainly can't have all that in one trip!Definitely a decadent tasty treat.~~#~1
Ok, im not getting the great reviews on this place. I FINALLY made it Lamar's before they closed for the day and tried a couple donuts. I have a few problems here. The big one, can we please list that "only the donuts with holes" are $5.49 for 6? Its a bit deceptive to just list the price of 6 and ring up the donuts and have them turn out to be well over $7. Makes me want to buy my donuts from someone else.    Second, these donuts are WAY over priced and they are average at best. The maple bar tastes like you are eating spoon fulls of sugar they are so sweet. And the rest of the donuts I tried were pretty stale. This will be the first and last time I will be going to Lamar's. Give me Krispy Kreme or anyone else for that matter. Thank god for Lamar's we dont have Spudnuts in the valley because they would be out of business.~~#~0
I am disabled with MS. The heat of summer about does me in, esp. in the car. Because of this, and because the best thing I've ever done for myself was to buy an electric Hamilton-Beach water kettle, I drink TEA. All day. Loads of it. Teavana is MUCHO EXPENSIVE, though I adore it. I learned of the Tea District through somebody's ad and like them very much as well. But, I had no idea we had a genuine tea company in Phoenix. And because of HomeRun, I was allowed to buy THREE vouchers. And because DragonFly is so awesome, they let me use all three to buy tea online and have it shipped to me all at once to avoid huge s&h fees. It should be here any day, and I can't wait to try their Cab(ernet) against Teavana's Opus Rouge. I love red heavily tart, fruity teas. It doesn't matter to me if there is no white, green, or black tea in it. In fact, I prefer it to just be the fruit. I drink it hot, and then as it cools all day in my tea pot, I keep refilling and either warm each huge travel mug with lid in the microwave, or drink it room temp, or even add some ice if it is particularly strong. I can EASILY drop $150 at Teavana, or $120 at Tea District and just touch on what I most want. With your three vouchers worth $60, I got to try two bags of every flavor I most wanted, except Peach (as they are out of it, but Holly wrote me several times and made recommendations based on what I had in my cart). I know I will love it, and go back to order the Peach when it is in stock again. Thank you so much for finding a local treasure and making it accessible.

Do you like trendy shit-music and half dressed plastic surgery queens gyrating all around you, while you pay twelve dollars for your appletini? If your answer is yes, don't bother coming here. Dive bars are plentiful in Phoenix, but the Bikini is in my 'hood. It's a dirty, unassuming place, with a couple of no-nonsense bartenders and a good jukebox. There are a couple of rules to follow when visiting the Bikini: 1. Bring cash. Cards aren't accepted, the atm machine is there for decoration only, as it hasn't worked in at least two years. 2. Don't make fun of the guy in the overalls and farmer hat. He's my neighbor. 3. Don't piss off the bartenders. Tip them well, treat them nicely, and don't order more than three dirty martinis. If you are nice to them, they will be nice to you. This includes, but is not limited to: the strength of your drinks, the price of your drinks, and whether or not you get a drink at all. They take no shit. If you can't handle it, stay away. The place gets crowded enough as it is.~~#~1
I have nothing more to add, but I don't want anyone to think 'only a few' people had  complaints about this poorly planned "festival." Oh, wait, I do. I was there with my 4 year old grand-daughter (and my daughter), since there were going to be kids attractions as well as the food trucks. I thought it was nuts that 3 minutes of jumping around cost $3. But I guess it was consistent with the $4 water and $7 beers.And it would help if there was some roadway controls and/or temporary signage. By 11am, traffic backed up (down) Pima from the event to Indian Bend and over towards the 101. Cars were skipping ahead and cutting into line, further delaying entrance. If success is measured by interest, the festival was a success. If by performance and customer satisfaction, not so much. And how can a vendor commit to showing and not have enough food to feed the presold ticket holders? Why risk your hard-fought reputation?~~#~0
I'm so sad I didn't discover the Herb Box sooner. I went for a girl's lunch and was blown away - by the decor, the vibe, the view and the food - and this was during the winter. I can't wait for patio weather because this will become a weekend go-to spot for me. The salads and sandwiches are delicious and the fries and chips - holy moly! They're amazing and you'll get tons of them. The decor is perfectly shabby chic with a traditional twist and I could seriously move in. If you and your mom and girlfriends love the quaint feel of Arcadia Farms, give Herb Box a whirl. It's got the same feel, but more modern. Love love love it.~~#~1
It's been a few months since I've been here, and what a change, not for the better. I usually get the same thing to start with, ceviche and pollo asado. Both are usually quite delicious, not this time.The ceviche had absolutely no flavor to it. As if the chef tried to make it as flavorless as possible. I did not finish it as it was not enjoyable in the least. Now for the tacos. Stale taco shells, dried and overcooked chicken, slopped on guac and no pico de gallo. The tacos were so bad I tried to rescue them by asking for pico de gallo, since they did not put any on, and then I was charged $1.00 extra. Of course, no manager was anywhere in sight. This place simply doesn't care. On the bright side, the margaritas and salsa are still good, but the chips were stale.Not only will I not return, but I can no longer recommend this place to businessmen from out of town. I see dozens of new business people every day who stay in Scottsdale and they always ask for Mexican food, and I've always said Cien Agaves. No more.~~#~0
There is something for everyone on the menu. It's more than pizza. The service is great. Get a table on the terrace and you get the view of the park and fountain. I will keep going back.~~#~1
I cannot say enough good things about this place! The food is amazing and the customer service is probably the best I've ever experienced. Every time my boyfriend and I dine here the owner visits with us and asks how we are, etc. I've only had Pho at a couple of places in town so I can't speak to the authenticity but it tastes amazing and fresh every time. Places that make good food and offer the kind of customer service these places do (and family owned is always a plus for me!) are just priceless. UnPhogettable is always worth the drive to Mesa.~~#~1
Delicious salad, pizza, and wine. We got the Padre pizza which is not on the menu, but fig, prosciutto, arugula, and ricotta... so delicious!! The crust is perfect! The best part is they have several BOTTLES of wine under $12. Yes, you could usually barely get a glass for that amount. Sold... ! We had the Four Vines ZIn that was amazing for only $10.99.~~#~1
I go to Pro's Ranch Market often for lunch- sometimes several times a week. I've had the street tacos, chile relleno, burritos, and some other tasty treats. I'm a huge fan of the agua fresca stand- my favorites are the strawberry, pineapple, and horchata. And the bakery... oh, the bakery. They have everything sweet you could want including individual servings of flan and tres leches cake. The store itself has the cheapest produce in town, a giant meat counter, and a great assortment of cheeses. Ranch Market also has super delicious tortilla chips and salsas. This is one of my favorite places to go if I'm on my way to a BBQ or party- there are so many options!~~#~1
Love this place! A must stop for anyone downtown needing a snack or a drink! Very good happy hour and unbelievable flavor combinations.On my last visit, I was pleased to try some happy hour toasts and fish and chips. Zero disappointment.~~#~1
I have only eaten here once, but i cannot wait to go back! the service was phenomenal, the potstickers huge and delicious! the orange beef - just as good as a pf changs!  I had a restaurant.com coupon, purchased $10 gift card for .80 cents!  Highly recommend!~~#~1
I am not one to hang out in Downtown Phoenix before or after an event because quite frankly it's boring.  However, when I visited Copper Blues on 2/4/12 prior to the comedy show next door I will definitely be hanging out after events.Here's Why ... They have a live band and over sixty beers on tap.  It's a nice cozy environment especially if you sit outside.  Budweiser drafts were only $5 and soda was only $3.  We didn't try their food but I hear the same owner owns both Copper and Stand Up Live so I am sure the kitchen is the same so I am confident in saying that the food is delicious because it was at Stand Up Live.Happy hour is 4PM to 7PM Sun-Thurs so its basically perfect when any event is taking place during on those days.On this Satuday night people were having a good time.  The draft beer was perfect and fresh.  The music was good and the bartender was real friendly and answered all of our questions cheerfully.We had such a great time that me and my wife are going back to Copper Blues on 2/23/12 to hang out and drink with friends prior to our comedy show next door.This is a nice spot and you have to check it out especially if you are going to the show next door !~~#~1
It's just a terrific steakhouse.  One of the most upscale, all around dining experiences in Phoenix. It's expensive.  Very expensive.  But probably worth it.  Figure $150-200 for a couple.I had the double filet medallion with blue cheese melted and a wine demiglaze.  Absolutely outstanding, amazingly tasty meats.  Equal or better than Morton's or Ruth's Chris or Capitol Grill (that's on the menu for tomorrow night).  Smashed potatoes were very good but nothing to write home about.  Veggies were pretty good.Started with the ceasar salary, with a big pile of anchovies.  Perhaps the best Caesar I've ever had.Desert was the mouse cake.  Good, but not to die for.Their happy hour is also an excellent value.  Come before six and drinks are half off, and they serve little mini steak sandwhiches, which are very good.Hint:  If you have kids, go to happy hour and have a drink or two.  Cocktails are in the $7 range happy hour price.  Cucumber cooler was quite nice for a cocktail.  Let the kids eat the sandwiches, and then head to the dining room for a couple of filets.  The kids are pretty full, you are nicely primed for a great steak, and the complete lack of a kids menu doesn't matter.  Honestly, otherwise, there really aren't any good kids options.  I know, it's not a great place for kids, even well behaved, but sometimes you want to celebrate a special occasion with family.  It would be nice if they offered a mini-filet for 12 and under for like $15, or a burger and fries for $10 for the kids.  Just a thought.Anyway, great experience, great food.  A really upscale, while linen, old style steakhouse kind of place to have prime beef.~~#~1
Cozy place, great amounts of food for little money, they serve koolaide!!!!  Its all great I loved it both times so far, once in 2003 when I went to review it for the school newspaper, and again 8 years later when I drove by it and the nostalgia made me try it again with the fiance~~#~1
Great food and very friendly service.  Happy to recommend!~~#~1
Yes, please! This place is AMAZING! I brought my family here after coming many times, and everyone LOVES IT! The wasabi mashed potatoes are KILLER! I HIGHLY recommend. I really don't know if there is anything to avoid at this place. Just love it every time! We have tried many dishes, and they are always flavorful and fabulous.~~#~1
There's a reason there's a banner that reads,' Food Network Challenge Winner', hanging in their farmer market booth. I've had Pastry Chef Chris's gingerbread cookies; biscotti; coconut/chocolate cookies; and their carrot cake, and they have all been really, really, reaaaaally good! But today, at the Ahwatukee Farmers Market, I was knocked out by what she calls "Lemon Sunshine."  Words can not describe how delicious their lemon and cream & graham crust tart/pie is.Lemon tarts/pies are among my all time favorite desserts. I thought that the ones I had from TK's bakeries and Veronique Mauclerc were as perfect as a lemon tart/pie could be. Slice Cake Designs Lemon Sunshine pie is dangerously perfect...A must try!!!!!~~#~1
This is my favorite breakfast & lunch place in Ahwatukee. The food is excellent. The service is friendly and they do what they do perfectly. This isn't a place to go for elegant sit down service. It's the perfect blend of self-service meets top restaurant quality food. Have the Croque Monsieur--or add an egg to make it a Croque Madame. You will not be disappointed. The bread and the baked goods are so good you could make a substantial meal off them alone.Finally, this is a small local business that truly cares about its community. They have shown up at two community fund raising events with huge boxes of warm, freshly baked cookies to donate. I'm grateful to have a place of this caliber in my neighborhood.~~#~1
I was impressed with this place. I had the Mongolian Lamb and an Asahi beer. It totaled $14.00 before tip which I thought was reasonable for dinner and especially for a lamb dish. The portions were very generous and even though I was starving when I stopped in, I ended up only eating about half of the meal before getting full. It was delicious. Tender lamb and a great sauce.The waiter was very polite and helpful and the food came out pretty quickly. It was very comfortable inside and the decor was tasteful. I did not expect that one of the best Chinese restaurants (of course in my opinion) would be located in Avondale. I feel bad for frequenting the Pei Wei on Dysart and McDowell so often when a non-chain place of this caliber is right up the road.~~#~1
There're times when you eat something and you want more. Then there are times when you eat something and you instantly know you will never have anything quite like it. For me, I experienced both of those at Pizzeria Bianco. My buddy and I drove almost 500 miles from Santa Barbara for a Giants-Diamondbacks game and thought we'd try this place I had heard about. We arrived fairly late so there was about a one hour wait but man, was it worth it. We ordered a Biancoverde and a Wiseguy. I was a bit skeptical at first because they each didn't have tomato sauce like I was used to, but I realized I dont care much for tomato sauce in the first place and I'm always up for trying new things. BEST DECISION OF THE DAY. The Biancoverde was my favorite. It was so simple (3 cheeses, arugula, and olive oil) yet so amazing. It has left me wanting more to this day. The staff was nice and friendly, not to mention a few cuties. I will definitely drive 500 miles for it again. In fact, I'll be making my way to Phoenix in a few weeks, JUST for the pizza!~~#~1
i know, i know. this gelato is a bit on the pricier side, especially when you consider that phoenix now has a bajillion gelato shops, that  each offer a million and one flavors for a few washingtons. HOWEVER, arlecchino is definitely the BEST. it's worth theprice, worth the drive, and worth the parking hassle. the owners are super nice and accommodating, and although there is a sample limit, the workers have never said no more. the flavors are classic, inventive, fresh, and authentic. plus, it's such a cute, tiny little hole-in-the-wall shoppe, that you can't help but love it in all it's quaint glory.~~#~1
I first visited this restaurant after my friend pushed me to visit the Hawaiian festival at the Tempe Town Lake a few months ago."Big deal," I thought. "How can a Hawaiian festival be fun?"Well, the food was amazing. And after having half a rotisserie chicken, I was craving for more.A few days later, I finally began my search for the perfect (or near perfect) Hawaiian restaurant, in which I can satisfy my Hawaiian cravings.My first stop was Mai Island Grill, located in/near the Arizona State University campus. Parking was a bit of a challenge; this is especially true during the lunch hour.When I finally found a parking spot, I went in and ordered. I had the short ribs plate. The plates include one scoop of macaroni salad and steamed rice.After placing my order for the short ribs, I ordered the Spam musubi.The guy preparing food replied with a laugh."Is it good?" I askedJay -- the man who operates this restaurant -- replied, "Yes it's good." Then he said something about how the guy who laughs never laughs (or something like that).About 10 minutes later, my food was ready.The food was fantastic; just what I was looking for!The prices are very reasonable. Plates are about $10 and less.I also suggest that you try the fish, beef, grilled chicken, and pork katsu.And finally, I hope that this place continues to provide the same liberal portions. Also, I think it would be cool if Mai Island Grill began serving two scoops of macaroni salad and two scoops of rice (just a fantasy of mine).Additional Notes:- Cash Only.- Opens late in the morning and closes early in the afternoon (call for exact hours).- There never seems to be any "Lumpia!" :-/~~#~1
They added broasted chicken to their menu... I love me some broasted chicken, so in I went to investigate.I do not love me THEIR broasted chicken.To me it tasted rubbery and had a strange odor, and it was so salty that an hour later I could still taste it. I ordered a few pieces and I ate part of one and then bolted.I can't speak to anything else on the menu. Their garlic knots, for what it's worth, were fine.~~#~0
I really don't like these types of Mexican food places because I feel my mom makes better Mexican food. Just a note: Not all Filibertos are the same. Food taste wise.....This Filibertos is BOMB though! They make great Spanish rice, and beans! All the food is great! But I recommend the rolled tacos if it's going to be your first time here. I think it's combo #8 haha. They also have some old school arcade games. That's a plus for me haha. Please stop going to Macayos they have the worst fake tasting Mexican food.~~#~1
Please give this place a try when you're making your next stop at Pita Jungle. This restaurant seems to be very underrated and overlooked. We went on a Wednesday night around 7:30pm and it was empty while Pita Jungle was packed. Just the two of us on the patio, which was very nice. The interior and atmosphere are great. Nice tables & chairs, candles, shelves with wine bottles and art, and a very nice bar.An Iranian family owns the restaurant and cooks everything themselves. That's the first sign of a high-quality establishment. They were incredibly nice to us and brought us whatever we needed. They gave us some good suggestions, like their Iced Black Tea, which is fantastic. It has a few other elements to it including Lavender. They brought us extra pita when we ordered some appetizers as well without us even asking.For our appetizers, we tried the hummus and the tabooli. The hummus was very creamy but a little plain. We wished there was more flavor or spice to it. Not a big deal. That was the only part of our meal that was not 5 stars, but 4 stars. The tabooli....ridiculous. I've never been a fan of tabooli. It usually has too much parsley. But their version was balanced perfectly.For an entree, I tried the Chicken Shawarma and we split a side of Basmati rice with saffron. A huge plate of rice with great seasoning. The saffron and olive oil gave the fluffy rice great texture. The Shawarma was fresh and delicious. The chicken was cooked and seasoned nicely.For dessert, we tried the Persian vanilla ice cream with rose water and saffron as well as the Baghlava. The ice cream was some of the best we've had. Great flavor. The Baghlava was a great complement to the ice cream. A nice sweetness from the honey and the flaky dough was great.So in summary, great atmosphere, great owners, out-of-this-world food, and very affordable. Everything we had came to about $32. We will return many times in the future because their menu is very promising. Just wish their name fit the type of place that it is. The current name makes it sound like just another Middle Eastern restaurant, which it definitely is not.~~#~1
Elmer, I love you.I have since I was a senior at Chandler High. Back then I was broke so I could only get a bean burrito and strips...and they were dang good. If anyone wants to complain about strips just being chips and cheese they can suck it.Now days I am a little less broke so I always get the green chili burro. And it is always so good. Spicy enough to burn a little and the tortilla is always fresh...thanks man.And bless your little Mexican Heart, you serve corn dogs...so I can even come here with my crazy picky kids. I love you Elmer. I always will.~~#~1
this is a business located in the fry's grocery strip mall on mckellips and recker I wont say much but don't bother the waitless girl was about as pleasent as a hemroid the beer selection sucked. I belive the owner was there at least the guy looked like the owner. it's always amazing to me how the service can be so horrible w/owner in house.~~#~0
Did I ever write about the time I left my ipad here?  Didn't realize for a couple of hours. Heart racing, I called, emailed, hoped it would be recovered. What gracious responses! I got an email early next morning, lots of reassurances, help for when/ how to pick up... Ok so I've reviewed this place before, key words are wonderful creative dishes, a light touch for subtle flavor (right now I'm having a delectable plate of greens, shaved herbs, summer squash wrapped around burrata--- who woulda thought?) but most amazing is the heart warming genuine service of all who care for you here.  Oh.. And there's mightly fine wine on "tap". Heh heh..~~#~1
The food is EXCELLENT!  We have been 5 times now, and everything we have had has been delicious!  We will continue to dine w Bill and IL Bosco!  The Caprese is AWESOME!~~#~1
This is my favorite Sushi Spot in Phoenix. I see Sushi Chefs from other restaurants coming here to eat during their off time. =)The prices are very reasonable, and all of the rolls and sashimi are very fresh and crafted to perfection by the old timers.The Ramen Noodle Bowl is awesome, and nothing like what you would buy in the grocery store. It is topped with pork, fish cake, bamboo, and seaweed. I highly recommend.They even have a fried salmon skin roll, which was very flavorful and not always available at every establishment. I wish that i would have taken a picture of the last one that I purchased, it was absolutely perfect.They also offer Takoyaki, which is like an octopus dumpling ball. You would have no idea that it contained octopus unless you were familiar with the dish. these are absolutely amazing and highly addictive. You have to try these during your visit.The last time that I was there, I had to try the Ichigo Mochi Ice Cream. It was green tea ice cream, surrounded by a rice flour shell and topped with whipped cream. It really hit the spot and I was so full but in a happy and satisfying way.If you like Sushi, and you think that RA is cool, hit yourself on the head for being a complete fool and go check this place out and get schooled on what fresh authentic Sushi is all about. Your mouth will thank you for doing the right thing!Cheers and keep up the good work at the place.FYI... Bring your own Saki if you need booze with your meal. I say, just enjoy the good meal without alcohol and see how happy and relaxed the meal makes you feel.~~#~1
5 stars isnt enough!!! I love the whole Briggs family. I have been going to this dentist since I was 8 years old and they have always been so amazing to me. I love that I walk in the door and they make me feel right at home. They are so sweet and everything in that place is actually super comforting.They use the most high tech things I have ever seen, and its good to know I'm getting A+ care for my pearly whites. I recommend them to everyone I know!~~#~1
Can not say enough good about this place.  I love it.  I love it!  I simply love it!  We have always had really great service and the food!  Well, the chips are thin and salty yumness and I love the salsa.  They keep you filled up and aren't like other places which try to ignore an empty container!Number 16 Combo is my guilty pleasure!  I have had it many times the way it's intended:  Chicken enchiladas with red sauce...but lately I've been getting it with Fundito sauce and I've gotta tell you:  I'm hooked!  Try it........it's a little more $$$ but SO worth it!I haven't had desert since I'm gluten free but the size of the fried ice cream is Gigantic.  My daughter swears by it!Man, I wish they were open right now...cravings have begun anew....~~#~1
This location was a Groupon find... Won't be back. The girl behind the counter was nice but even though I had the groupon right in front of me, she had to read it several times and I had to explain to her what I was supposed to be getting with it. The red light therapy is a nice idea... But the room the bed was in was lacking. They should hire an exterminator, not leave sticky bug traps down with dead bugs all over the floor where people generally have bare feet... Yuck!!~~#~0
Best Vietnamese food I've had, and I've been to some very good Vietnamese places. Very fresh and delicious.~~#~1

Went today for the first time. The quesadillas were the best I've ever had. My husband had the Cuban sandwich, which of course I tried...it was equally delicious! The atmosphere made me feel like I was back in the Bahamas. And not to forget the staff. We sat at the bar, and the bartenders were wonderful and so nice!~~#~1
I dream about their chopped salad...I, too, would use it as my screen saver if I didn't share a computer.~~#~1
This is the best restaurant chain EVER!!!!  I love EVERYTHING there and the service has always been A+.  The fried zucchini strips (appetizer) are the best in the world, the Caesar salad is the best I ever had, even their croutons on the salad are better than any!!!  Olive oil herb dip is Fabulous, the warm bread is like no other.  Most of the dinners that I have tried have been excellent but the Chicken Bryan is magnificent.  Waiters and manager the best.~~#~1
Fun little place to just explore and TRY so many different samplings.    The staff was great and super friendly!  The lemon cupcakes were AMAZING!!!  Little tip:  buy a baguette to try all the great olive oils and tapenades~~#~1
Melrose Pharmacy is my go-to pharmacy.  Not only is it in my neighborhood, it is independently owned and operated by Teresa Stickler.  Her and her husband Kurt are people who care about the community.  The fact that they provide a level of service that their chain store competitors can only dream of is a is the icing on the cake.  They are also lightening quick, dispensing most prescriptions while you wait.Moreover, they are a FULL  service pharmacy, they also offer delivery (handy when you feel like you are on the verge of death) and useful recommendations on the pros and cons on a on non-prescription drugs and vitamins (often recommending the lower priced generic brand).  In addition, you can find a wide variety of homeopathic products, as well as a selection of snacks, books and small gifts.Even if you don't need to get a prescription filled, it's worth a visit to check out the retro interior and grab and grab a vintage bottled pop and candy.  Better yet, stop by on a First Friday when the pharmacy features live music, and frequent art shows in the studio in the same complex.~~#~1
Loved this place!!!! Was searching for a great authentic BBQ place, and this is it!!!!!~~#~1
Wow. If you're into owner-driven, husband-and-wife run, casual and unpretentious yet upper-class/comfortable "fine" environs, food, service, wine, and music (acoustic live music 3x/wk (with no cover!)), the kind of place where everyone talks to/welcomes everyone yet no one is nosy or cliquish, where the whole place cheerfully claps when Mrs Owner breaks a glass (and someone calls out "it's earlier than that normally happens,"),  free wi-fi, where you have a nice patio with heaters and a front-row Fountain view, wine by the bottle from their extensive retail collection or yours -- with just a $5 corkage (as well as a decent (7-9 reds and 7-9 whites selection by the glass for $7-$10), a great craft beer selection (Union Jack IPA!), couches, nice hightops, an l-shaped bar, great local artwork (also for sale), this will be your new favorite place.If you like stuffy, over-priced, boring, see-to-be-seen places with angry (or no) music, this place isn't for you.Second time here and Mr Owner greets me by name.  Are you kidding?! Does that happen anymore? And when I say to him "that's cool," someone else in the bar comments about how I must be new because that's just how they do it here.You can order anything off the menu from next door (Euro Pizza Cafe) for no up-charge. Amazing. Get the "Dr Oz Sautéed Veggies.". Trust me. This place has a great vibe and one part of me hopes these positive reviews don't result in oppressive crowds, but on the other hand, something tells me they'd handle it with a smile and 5 star service.Get here. Just get here.~~#~1
This is a great Thai food restaurant. My husband and I have been here a few times and have been very pleased with the food, as well as the service. We usually order a few curries and of course the pad Thai. The food is always consistently good. Good Thai food is sometimes hard to find, you definitely won't be disappointed here.~~#~1
I came here for the first time ever on Mother's Day. They were packed ,the line was out the door and down the path. Still they managed to get everyone seated and quickly attended to.We were a party of 10  our server was so great and i am sorry to say i do not remember her name. She had all 10 drinks refilled continuously. Brought us lemons and cleared the table with amazing speed, as well as taking care of a completely full restaurant packed with Children that were running under foot.   The only down part was that they had plastic dishes but, with all those people what are your choices.I loved the food. I had shrimp and fish and vegetables.  Nothing fried.       The best part for me was the Chocolate fondu!!  Although there were many different choices. You could never say that you did not like what they were serving.  have seen a million adverts for this place and i am happy that i finally got to go.~~#~1
I ate here for the first time a few weeks ago on a Friday night/Saturday morning after seeing a show at the Tempe Improv.I came in around midnight and the place was not that busy. The waitress was pretty nice (did everything expected for a waitress) and the guy who I thought was the manager was easy to talk to. However, those are the only two good things I can say about the restaurant.I ordered the BBQ wings and they were TERRIBLE. The flavor was very bland and half cold. The blue cheese I ordered was quite watery as well.I also sat by the kitchen and noticed that a guy in the back was washing a stool in a sink near where the food was made. Needless to say, I won't be eating at Hooters anytime soon.~~#~0
The best !From my first shredded beef taco almost a year ago  ..i have been lovin' this place.I also love the number 13 combo platter (.Mini beef chimi's ,Gauc ,rice and beans) The tacos are 5 star fresh and yum ! ... AND reasonably priced.~~#~1
We showed up out of the blue on Valentine's night looking for food. We got a seat at the sushi bar right away, but the place was otherwise packed. I guess we were lucky. We passed on the V-day prix-fixe menu and decided to order as we ate.Our waitress was visibly perturbed by my wife's order of tap water to drink and vegetable tempura to start. Judging by her expression, she took us for deadbeats; it wasn't offensive but hilarious, we're old enough to be confident in our own opinions of ourselves. Anyway, the vibe at the W was definitely people trying hard to be cool and of-the-moment.In any event, we struck up a conversation with the chef behind the bar where we were sitting. We initially ordered some basic sashimi dishes, but when I asked the chef for suggestions, he started rattling off a series of custom creations he could make. So we let him do his best, and he turned out a great collection of sashimi dishes, none, at least as far as I could tell, on the menu. We had a great meal, and we would definitely return, at least if we didn't live in San Diego.(The waitress eventually warmed up, probably thawing as she watched us eat through plate after plate of sashimi....)~~#~1
I didn't know what to expect from this store. It was over 105° so I wanted something cold! You get samples to help you or confuse you in to many choices! I went with the basic: cookies& cream mixed with vanilla carmel. Do yourself a favor & get the large so you can mix plus go on Thursday for double stamp day!~~#~1
Absolutely unbelievable!!! This is so worth the drive from Scottsdale to Tempe! But get there early as they close early and run out of food! It's so delicious my mouth is watering just thinking about it. I love French pastries, crepes and desserts! The macaroons melt in your mouth. I will be returning soon!~~#~1
Best Ice cream sandwhich I have ever had~~#~1
Took Maddie here for a quick nail trim, was super impressed. Friendly staff, prompt service, and light on the wallet. What more could you want. My dog is with me always, so I wont need the boarding services, but will definitely make this my new pet vet! My co-workers have gone to the vaccination clinic they have where they were also impressed by the service and low price! Thumbs up for this place!~~#~1
Wow, this place is still here? I went there as a girl (15+ years ago) with the family on a regular basis. If it's still around, then it MUST be good!~~#~1
This is my favorite venue--we've held two events here, and I've attended another four.As an attendee, it's clean, bright, FREE parking, good food, constantly refreshed coffee and beverages, and good layout.  I love it.  As a planner, it's a good deal for what you get, and it's a well managed event end to end.  Conference staff are easy to work with, flexible, and they are there to support you.  IT works and it works well. it's a great facility, food, service, and staff.  Good open expo area too, if you have vendors, advice--do not use a separate room if you have a lot of vendors--put them in the main ballroom, and/or the vestibule, not in any other room.  Vendors like to be showcased and have traffic, not shuttled off to a low traffic low visibility area --regardless of any price savings.~~#~1
Rarely give a 5, but truthfully? We set out to go to Giuseppes and stopped here...thought we were there...I'm sure Giu. is good, but Arrivederci is the bomb. We will keep going on every visit. Reasonable and really, really authentic. Bueno Sera is your welcome..and they mean it! We loved it. . . reasonable, too. b~~#~1
The pool area was very nice.  Every chair had a towel on it ready for you.  The pool service was great.  Greg Badger is the most hard-working waiter there.  He was out in the sun in upper 90/lower 100 degree temperatures and was very helpful to all the guests.  I ate at Elements the other times I visited Arizona, but the poolside menu is great too! I preferred the orange chicken bento box.  Although edamame was not on the poolside menu, our waiter was able to get it for us.  That is great service!The bed was very comfortable; nice and soft.  I also liked the wall-mounted, flatscreen LCD tv.The valet service was great as well.  We were greeted everytime we drove into the Sanctuary complex.  The tennis courts were very nice as well.  I played during the morning and made use of their ball machine to warm up.~~#~1
We recently moved nearby Pho Ao Sen and dine there often. I love their food, the service, and also the atmosphere. My favorite's are the bun dishes, I always order the no. 26 with chicken instead of pork and they have a delicious vegetarian lemongrass beef vermicelli that I would highly recommend. Pho Ao Sen is a great place to dine with friends, mine have always enjoyed the experience.~~#~1
Read al lthe hype, so decided to give Cyclo a try.  What a disappointment!  Portions were small and overpriced, owner thinks she's the next best thing to sliced bread.  She needs to go back to Vietnam to remember how real Vietnamese food is prepared.Give this place a miss.~~#~0
I was in Phoenix for three weeks on a business trip and luckily found this spot on my 3rd day in town.  I ended up eating here 7 times in 21 days.  I brought my coworkers here, and they all ended up eating here at least 2-3 times.  It's just that good.So how good is it?  Lets just say that their tortilla soup was the only thing that could cure my horrible hangover after a long night in Scottsdale!I've eaten the fish tacos, fajitas, enchiladas, nachos, and tortilla soup.  All were exceptional!  They also bring out chips with salsa, as well as beans, which was a nice touch.The dining area is fairly small, but they do have an outside dining area as well.  The wait staff is very friendly, and they will get you drinks as soon as you sit down, which is something that more restaurants should do!  The food comes out very quickly, and they do have 2 TVs, one on either side of the dining room, which are usually tuned to a sporting event.I've been out of Phoenix for 3 months now and I miss Mi Pueblo!  I'll definitely be going back the next time that I'm in Phoenix!~~#~1
Ok so us 5 hot chix got all dolled up for dinner at City Hall it was about 7 when we arrived on Saturday. The service was top notch from the get go starting with the valet. We were seated by a pleasant hostess in the large main room. Our waiter was an entertaining gentleman, that's one huge plus I have to say about Mastro's is they "usually" have seasoned wait staff they really know their product.They brought us the great basket of warm breads, we ordered bottled water for all and a bottle of some 06 Sauv Blanc that was mighty tasty. It was impossible to have an empty glass this night!Everyone had fillet's but me of course, I mainly had apps, side's, wine and desert ;) I did try the seared ahi tuna it was ok I wasn't too impressed with it though. Beefsteak tomato & mozz (see pics) very yummy! The creamed corn, sauteed asparagus and mash were all very good!! I couldn't talk anyone into the lobster mash or any caviar boohoo me. =(  Everyone loved their meal!!My g/f was coming back from the bathroom and missed a step or something somehow she lost her shoe but there was a busser or someone right behind her he picked it up for her and even put it back on for her! Now that is what I call 5 Star Service!!We had creme brle they served it with various fresh berries and a huge bowl of their fresh made whip cream yum-gasm's were had all around. While Mastro's is not my top choice since I am not a "Steakhouse kinda girl" it was all good stuff. They always play some  Michael Bubl and who doesn't just love him!?! It was about 3 bills total and we went home with doggy bags and full tummy's.P.S.  I had their sweet potato fries they were good but I like the ones at Fez better....just sayin. (O_o)~~#~1
I love this place! My girlfriend and I go here to celebrate special occasions and the staff is so friendly. We sat at the bar last time and the bartender Jesse was so great. The happy hour menu was amazing too. $5 Mark West Pinot Noir! The manager was super friendly and came over to make sure we were doing okay. Great experience! Definitely recommend the calamari too!~~#~1
I can only vouch for the chicken salad, as it's the only thing I've ever tried in the 20 years I've been coming here. It's THAT good. I always think about trying something else, but why mess with perfection?Walking inside gives you the sense that you've stepped into a time machine and arrived in the late 70's. I, personally, find it to be awesome. Most of Scottsdale is lacking in historic flare. And yes, the late 70s is historic by Scottsdale standards. Besides, whatever money they're not spending on updating the decor is clearly going right into their magically delicious chicken salad.~~#~1
I would order silvermine over Jimmy Johns ANY DAY! They have the best meatball sub....compared to Jimmy' Johns it is GOLDEN (never mind the fact that JJ's doesn't have hot subs...) They are always fast to deliver and the food is always great. My go to sandwich shop  **MUCH LOVE TO SM!*~~#~1
Put it in the baby book.  Baby's first AJ's.  And you'll always have a special soft place in your heart for your first.  I love that while this location is in a nice part of town, it's not quite the same level of frou-frou as many other spots.  That means rather than dealing with the Scottsdale types who have to dress up to go to the store - you're dealing with a greater range of folks - but they are all willing to pay a bit more for the good stuff.  I will say, you'll pay less for a box of cereal or box of triscuits at a Circle K than you will at an AJ's. And I don't think I've ever seen anything on sale.  But there is just nothing like their fresh food.  Be it produce or the meat section, the colors are brighter, the items are bigger and you just know it's going to taste better.  Their chicken breasts and pork chops are so amazingly good, and so large, you want to eat them all at once, but you just can't.  You have to try some of their pre-prepped meats.  My fav is a pork loin with apple stuffing.  Wow. And of course, great pre-made foods too if you just want to pick up something to go.  I've been suckered in to their desert section far too many times.  And they are always good.  But dang they can be pricy - so it really has to just be a special splurge.  If you haven't tried an AJ's yet, I suggest this one to ease you into things.   There may be quite a few Lexus in the parking lot, but there won't be too many Hummers.~~#~1
Thanks to everyone who put up with all the closed roads and driving detours yesterday for the marathon.  As one of the largest marathons in the country it was really cool to see all the spectators, volunteers and bands supporting and encouraging the 34,000 runners. I finished the half marathon yesterday and the war wounds aren't nearly as bad, but I am sore as hell still. It became clear at the startline  that we really have to do something about the Capitol complex. That area is a disaster.  Thanks for all the carb-heavy food and drink at the start and finish.  I have never enjoyed spilling hot coffee all over myself up until yesterday morning. Thanks to the UPS drivers who hauled our stuff to the finish.The half-marathon doesn't run through the most attractive parts of Phoenix, but McDowell Road is definitely a step up from Van Buren..  That's for sure. Could you imagine thousands of runners trying to dodge hookers on their way to the finish line?And also, thanks to the guys in my running corral who dressed up and ran as the Super Mario Bros: Mario and Luigi.  You guys rock.~~#~1
I have been going to Cartel for a while, and their coffee has absolutely spoiled me. I can hardly drink coffee or esspresso from anywhere else, I even buy their beans and brew it at home.Most of the bartista's are stellar, but expect to wait for your specialty drinks, not only because they are almost always busy, but also because making kick ass coffee drinks takes time.I suggest either the Honduras with cream, an iced agave latter, or a cappuccino (which you have to drink there).~~#~1
So, there's no negative stars, too bad. Tried ordering take out before actually eating there to try it - good thing, you couldn't pay me to eat here.The only thing about the Colossal Cobb salad I ordered was the price. $10 and change for lettuce just enough to cover the bottom of the styrofoam with a sprinkle of toppings. Where'd they get their chef, Chili's? What a disappointment. All the reviews say ' a lot of food' ...for who, an infant?I had also ordered a couple of carmelized cookies as well. Didn't know deep fried, greasy discs of oatmeal harder than concrete were called 'cookies'. Good grief, the bakery wasn't even good! Had to spit those things out before they took out a filling. The only good thing about Chandler Chompie's is Jason's Deli right next door.~~#~0
I am totally baffled why this place gets such good reviews. I have been there a few times because it's close to my work and I received some gift certificates for my birthday. Unfortunately after the last experience, I can't go back.  Although they are very nice and have great prices, I have to reveal the ugly truth: 1. They don't put any effort into sanitizing the tools or the pedicure bowl. I actually saw them clean the brushes and tools in the water I was soaking my feet in and then just rinse out the bowl after they were done... not spray, soap, nothing!2. Reason #1 probably explains why my heals cracked so severely after my pedicure that they began to bleed.  I had to use peroxide, neosprin, and bandages for almost a week to get it heal. 3. They water down their nail polish... so much that it destroys the bond and polish never actually dries. I hate to bash a business with good customer service, but these practices are simply unacceptable.  I obviously won't be back. =(~~#~0
If you want a deal for your buck, this is the place to go! You'll find Dewalt, Makita, Oster, Cuisinart, Farberware, Keurig, and many other banded items for a fraction of the original retail price. Yes, some items will be out the package, missing a manual, or may have a scratch or a dent but I rather pay a fraction of the price versus paying full retail at a department store. I rather save money and get a ridiculous deal for the same exact item I would have paid 10X more at a well organized and clean shop. From what I know this store has been open for nearly ten years; the owners are one of the nicest people I've met; they even offer free delivery with the furniture or any other large item you purchase. Stop by!! You'll get a kick from just walking down the unorganized, messy aisles; but once you get to the register to pay- you'll be happy!! "Get more for less!"~~#~1
Hip hop sandwich shop.  Not a traditional dining experience.  Food was great, and prices were very great.  Everything on menu was under $10.  Mac and Cheese is worth ordering as an appetizer, and the BLT was rediculously delicious. I look forward to going back again, and probably again.~~#~1
Had the best BEST time here tonight! My mama and best girlfriends treated to me a fun day for my birthday and I insisted on wrapping up the afternoon with happy hour on me. I've never been but we wanted to go somewhere nice and stopped in. The restaurant is beautiful- we sat in a high back comfy booth in the bar which is really nice. The bar has shelves of backlit colorful liquor bottles above it (ala the Ocean Club bar). We has 2 rounds, including the Vitamin C martini, White Chocolate Martini, Flirtini and Black Cherry cocktail- they were all really great! We also got the colossal shrimp appetizer (which technically weren't all that colossal, they were just normal), the sliders (the bacon and maytag bleu cheese was amazing!) and the AZ Eggrolls (a bit on the greasy side but very tasty and perfect for happy hour). The tab was only $65 (it was happy hour and the prices averaged about $6/ drink and app). The service was also extremely good. It's been a long time since I felt like raving about a restaurant- it was great!~~#~1
Love it here!  Always unique and slightly dark art.  Definitely a go see if you are in phoenix~~~#~1
I never knew this movie theater existed. I mean I don't frequent paradise valley mall that often, and when I go, I have tunnel vision as I go straight to the stores I need to go to and get the heck out of there. So when Travelzoo had their movie special ( two tickets, 1 large popcorn and two large drinks for $15), I couldn't pass it up. The theater is small but very quaint. The seats are EXTREMELY comfortable and they kinda recline. How cool is that. Plus the best part? the staff are super duper friendly. A huge win in my book. I will definitely be going back to this cute little hidden gem of a theater.~~#~1
UMMMMMMMM...can I just say that this place needs to get more action!  The pizzas here are FANTASTIC!!  I discovered this place because it opened above SACKS.  It is around the corner from my house and I am so thankful it is.  The whole restaurant is open...I wish it had a little more space, but that is ok.  First, the Tuscan Pie is to die for!!  It has prosciutto, Gorgonzola, apple, arugula, a fig marmalade and balsalmic vingerette reduction sauce drizzled on top...at least I think that is what it is...I need to check the menu...but anyways its FABULOUS!!!  I wish I could eat it everyday!  I tried their Moroccan Pizza before they took it off the menu and it was awesome too!  Every single salad is great and the wine and beer selection is great too!  The staff is so nice and friendly.  I get this to go all the time and bring it home...and I have shared this with my friends too.  I love good Italian pizza and its great!~~#~1
I love this place they do the best job, I even drive 45 min because I moved and they are worth it! I'm always happy with the results. My nails don't lift or chip. I have also had a facial their and it was amazing. It was my first facial however I was happy and it wasn't expensive. I would recommend this place to anyone. Just bring cash for your tip, they do take cards but not for tips.~~#~1
My sister recently took her '98 VW New Beetle to First Class Auto in Scottsdale, AZ for an overheating issue.  I'm normally the one who does the maintenance on the vehicle but I was ~600 miles away.  She described the symptoms as follows: overheating light came on while she was stuck in construction traffic and went back off once she was moving again.  I immediately suggested that the radiator fans may not be coming on for some reason.  Since I wasn't around to look at it, she took it to First Class Auto.She relayed the symptoms to the guys at First Class and also SPECIFICALLY requested they check  radiator fan functionality.They told her the water pump was cracked and leaking, needed a new thermostat and also replace the timing belt and serpentine belt while they were in there (water pump is driven by the timing belt on this engine--2.0L 8V 4 cyl AEG code).  Well, a) I personally replaced the timing belt, water pump and serpentine belt about 10,000 miles ago as preventative maintenance.  What's more is the car hasn't lost any coolant since the job.  So the water pump being cracked is highly unlikely!  I did not replace the thermostat, though.  Once she called me to tell me this, I told her to decline the work and either take it somewhere else or wait for me to make a trip out.I had a job to do that brought me almost half way to the Phoenix area so I decided I would make the trip the rest of the way to have a look for myself yesterday.  FIRST thing I did was check the radiator fans.  I turned on the AC and the fans didn't come on at all.  I pop the cover off the strip fuse panel that resides on top of the battery and found a melted 30 AMP fuse.  Guess what that fuse is for?  The RADIATOR FANS!  Imagine that.  Being a car that lived most of its life in Michigan, some of the fuses and the fuse panel itself had become corroded and caused the one fuse and part of the fuse panel to melt.  The coolant level was exactly at the max level, right where it was after I did the maintenance on it 10,000 miles ago, not to mention I checked it before her recent trip to Scottsdale (didn't have to add anything.  The car doesn't leak a drop of coolant).Local dealer had a new fuse panel in stock, I swapped it out and replaced all 3 of the 30 amp blade fuses as they were all corroded pretty badly.  The larger strip fuses were still decent.  The radiator fans now work as normal and the car does not overheat.  The hose coming off the thermostat also becomes pressurized and hot at the correct temperature as well, so that's definitely not a problem!  Fans also come on automatically once the coolant temp hits 99 deg Celsius like they're supposed to.  Problem solved!I drove down to First Class Auto today to give them a chance to explain/defend themselves, but there was only one guy working in the shop who she didn't recognize and no one at the counter.  What great customer service!So she COULD have spent the quoted $800 and STILL had the same problem!  She just got dinged for a ~$40 diagnostic fee... for an incorrect diagnosis.~~#~0
I absolutely love this sub shop! Its the only place i will get a sub sandwich! I have been going here for over 10 years and i NEVER get tired of it! Mitch is an awesome owner and he really cares about the customer! MUST GO!~~#~1
I'm one of those people that loves frozen yogurt.  Anything that taste this great and is this guilt-free will get me every time.  The Golden Spoon has a variety of flavors of fro-yo, and each delicious flavor is only 88 calories per 4 ounces.  This is good news, my friends.On top of that, the price is very reasonable.  I got the mini (which is 4 ounces) and it rang up to $2.14.  When I compare it to Desert Swirl (your other choice of fro-yo on the Westside), this is extraordinarily more affordable.The service was not overly friendly, but just fine.  The ice cream chick was happy to give us some samples.I highly recommend the Heath flavored fro-yo.  Delicious.~~#~1
After moving back to the area from Cali I needed somewhere  to get my acrylics done. I usually like to get some kind of design or unique tips. After walking in I saw some tips I liked so I decided to try out this place. The first visit was bad the nail tech would not listen to the length of nails I was requesting and did a terrible job at shaping them. I always give people more than one chance so I went back and this time I got a pedicure first then the nail tech left the salon and I sat near the dryer for 45  min before approaching the manager about the length of time I had been waiting for a fill. He replied unapologetically that the tech had to leave to pick up her son from school... I sat another 15 min before I was seen by someone else. They also did a poor job. I will not spend my money somewhere that they do not value their customers. Not to mention they did a crap job and were overpriced when it came to designs and tips with prints on them. Don't waste your time here.~~#~0
We saw a small door with a sign over it and were intrigued, so we went inside - that's how we found Kazimierz.  Once our eyes adjusted (it's dark inside, like any good speakeasy), I loved the decor.  It's a wine bar with food that seems to be Egyptian flatbreads and then whatever the chef wants to make.  We were there on a Saturday, right in the middle of happy hour, and enjoyed a ridiculous evening of items that were mostly $8.  Wine flights, flatbreads, certain bottles of wine = $8.  BOTTLES OF WINE.  I'm sure they were just cleaning out old inventory, since they have hundreds of listings, but for these two wines, until they ran out of bottles, the bottles were $8.  We had the Northern Territory flatbread (pancetta, yukon gold potatoes, rosemary, crème fraîche and smoked gouda). Yum. We also had an open faced sandwich made with smoked pork belly, apple butter and melted cheese with sweet potato chips on the side.  IT WAS $7.  Between the $8 bottle of wine and that, I felt like I was stealing from these people. The bartenders were great, as so was the music.  I will, without question, be going back.~~#~1
This place is a lil bit of awesomeness! The food was great, the service was awesome, and the atmosphere was very nice! What's not to like about a great steakhouse that serves great food and provides awesome service.~~#~1
They do a great job! My old dry cleaner was always destroying buttons on my shirts. Never happens at Titan. Friendly staff, too. Also, good place to have alterations & shoe repairs next door...in the back of a barber shop.~~#~1
We have had nothing but good luck at this franchise so far. We've been here probably a dozen times. It's always clean and the food is fresh and the way it ought to be. Yum!~~#~1
Was at Zinc again last night and have to say the place keeps getting better still.  Started with the crepes again, perfect again.  Then shared the scallops and lamb shank for dinner.  I'm not usually a huge fan of lamb OR scallops but they were recommended and I was feeling adventurous.  The lamb -  AMAZING.  Melt in your mouth wonderful.  More like a stew than anything with classic fall off the bone tender meat over creamy cheesy polenta.  Their bread is perfect French bread too.  This time of year (winter) there is a festive, buzzy energy with a good crowd but not TOO long of a wait.  Make reservations though for sure.  Oh, and Bobby's across the way in Kierland is a nice spot for a pre-dinner drink (400s Hollywood glamour meets The Jetsons with cool live jazz your parents or grandparents would have enjoyed back in the day).~~#~1
Baiz Market is a "Mediterranean" type restaurant, or "Arabic" type food. Well, you could get confused and call it that. The fact of the matter is though, that this place has a very unique touch. This restaurant is a staple not only for groceries, but also its food. The owner is persian, so you can tell where the tastes are coming from. Its somewhat hidden in the heart of Phoenix, but that's ok, once you are there you will be glad you found it.This place is unique because they make their own bread! Are you kidding me? I only recently found out about this place like 3 years ago, and I've been living in Phoenix for 20 years. The chicken and beef shawarma have a special, authentic taste because of the fresh bread. One of the best parts about the shawarma is not only its amazing taste, but the pricing is very fair as well. I don't think I can stress this enough, but the fresh bread just sets this place apart from all the impostors in the Phoenix metro area. Why haven't the other restaurants caught on? I know of maybe one persian restaurant that makes their own bread, but their pricing makes them a different story (I'm talking about 'The Persian Room' in Scottsdale).I just don't understand how other restaurants can serve the bread that comes in plastic bags from a manufacturer hundreds of miles away. 'Good bread' and 'Arabic bread' are all good forms of pita that have great shelf life due to the ridiculous amounts of preservatives, but they just don't taste fresh.If you like the bread, head to the back of the store and there is a shelf of freshly baked pita bread, its baked throughout the day, I think. I can tell because sometimes my bread is still warm and the bag has a little condensation. Beware though, the bread gets hard and crunchy after a few days, so you really need to use it quickly. This isn't bad, its just I think they choose not to add preservatives to ensure the freshness of the pita.I usually just get the chicken or beef shawarma, but I decided I'd get a kabob plate one day because I also wanted hummus. The beef kabob plate came with hummus, bread, 2 skewers of beef kabob, and some pickles and onions. Wow. The beef kabobs were cooked perfectly, and were EXTREMELY tender. It was a tad bit on the lemony side, but I suppose that was necessary to make it so tender. Perhaps some of the best 'persian kabobs' I have ever had. The hummus was definitely good as well, I can't stand restaurants that crack open a can of premade hummus. This restaurant certainly did not disappoint with the hummus.I know friends in Tucson that make stops specifically at this place for shawarma, and rightly so. If you're weary of persian food, just check this place out. Its not expensive at all, food for two is like $15. The wide variety of ethnic foods is also interesting.~~#~1
The single best ribs I've ever had at any restaurant.  This place is brand new and off to a great start.  The mac and cheese was delicious, the bone marrow was great (as usual) and the staff and chef were friendly and helpful.  I'll be back here!~~#~1
Yum yum yum! Mexican food has to me my favorite type of food and Arriba is for sure at the top of my list for Mexican restaurants! This is a New Mexican style restaurant with lots of hatch green chilies in their dishes. You can also buy them fresh from here by the pound during the month of August. I have eaten here probably 30+ times and they are always consistent. The chips are always fresh and warm  they serve two different salsas as well as bean dip. All three are the bomb! My favorite item on the menu is the whitesands chimichanga. Do not order this though if you can't handle spicy stuff. but if you are like me, the spicier the better, then go with this! Everyday they have good lunch specials. I like to go on Thurs because they have chimis for $1.99. For an extra dollar they will smother it with the white sands sauce. What a deal! And on Sunday they have kids day with a clown that makes animal balloons. And best of all, kids eat free! And if your a beer drinker they have a microbrewery too. I'm not a beer drinker though so I can't tell you how good it is. But the margaritas are on point!~~#~1
LOVE the Four Peaks. Can get crowded as hell, and parking is a bit of a cluster F, but I've never ever not had a fun night there.  The beer is excellent, the service has always been attentive, and the food is above normal bar standardsThe fish and battered fries was very good, the tartar sauce is good, but ask for the cocktail sauce . . . it's fantastic.  Heavy on the horseradish enough to feel it in your nose!  And the Rueben might just be the best in town.The happy hour is great.  $3 locally brewed pints?  Sign me upThe location and the it being an actual brewery gives it extra points.  I had family in town this week, and I like to take out of towners to places that have a local AZ vibe.  They definitely got a taste of MY Arizona.  Next time they'll have to come during Pumpkin Porter season~~#~1
A burger? With anything I want? FINE....I'll do it.I need no convincing for a burger, fries and a coke (Thanks Carl's Jr.) Earleir this afternoon, after a heavy morning of househunting with a couple realtors, I decided to sit my fat backside at a table and eat. And eat well.I stumbled into the Five Guys at the Fashion Square mall. Not sure how long it's been open. Perhaps it was the grand opening?It was PACKED! But I digress.As soon as you get to this location in the food court of the mall, you'll realize that this is not your typical burger joint. They have their own seating separate from the mall-commoners. And their own bathrooms (CLEAN)You get to the counter and you see a sign telling you about the potatoes they are using for the fries you will be eating.Ordering your burger isnt a gong show. Fairly easy. All the toppings are listed and all toppings are FREE!My food was delicious. Got a burger with some of my favorite toppings: onions, tomatoes, etc. The fries reminded me of an experience I had back in high school, when I held a girls hand for the first time. Soft, perfect and lovely. That's how these fries felt. Ok that sounded weird. Tough.Oh, I forgot to mention that the soda fountains had COKE ZERO!! EFFING AWESOME! I MEAN THIS IS THE MOST DOPE SODA EVER!! (I'm really hoping this Kanye yelping phase ends soon, since my reviews make me seem like a bigger Jackass than I seem in person).Ultimately, I left this place happy, satisfied and I will come back again.Oh...the answer to the one question in everyone's mind? YES, BETTER THAN IN-N-OUT!~~#~1
Came here with the hubs- and we love the place :)  We were able to eat here for significantly less dinero than you typically spend at any other sushi restaurant.  The food comes by on the conveyer belts and the items are price coded by the color plate they are on.  At the end of your meal you just add up the plates for your total.  Each plate comes with 4-6 pieces of sushi- and they also have salads, desserts, appetizers, etc on the belt.  If you are afraid that the sushi has been on the belt for too long or there is something else that you would like that isn't currently on display you can order direct from the bar.  Win win :)~~#~1
On top of how good the food is, their customer service is excellent. I went to eat there on Thursday (the 16th), and had the best server ever. He was the bartender as well, and still payed tons of attention to my table. He was very nice, and very helpful. He had extensive knowledge of the menu. He was also very personable. He laid out samples of their various barbeque sauces while giving some details about each one. He squirted them out onto an extra plate he brought to the table, and he made the shape of a smiley face with all the sauces. He made that dining experience so good that I wish I could write a review about him personally and suggest to his managers that he get a raise! I couldn't hear him when he stated his name over a large group that had just come in and was moving tables, but he was wonderful.  Also, one of the people with me is from the east coast, and likes vinegar-based barbeque sauce. They didn't have any of that kind in their current rotation of sauces, and he actually went back to the kitchen and explained the situation. A lady from the kitchen made a vinegar-based barbeque sauce from scratch just because one of us had mentioned how much we loved it.   I've never experienced service like that, and really can't say enough about how great this guy, and all other staff I came into contact with, was! Great job to whoever hired him.  The food was delicious, I love their fries! Unlike anything you can get anywhere else. I got the country roasted chicken- great seasoning, super moist and tender, while still having that chargrilled/roasted skin (my favorite). All of their sauces are so good; it's hard to choose just one! (And no matter how many times I go there, I always sample each one again).  All positive things to say about this Famous Daves!Oh- and I forgot to mention the corn muffins...beyond words! Seriously, you have to try them. Now I'm craving one, and I'm pretty sure they're not open at 3:00 a.m. I wish I could order them by the dozen haha~~#~1
I called several pool service companies before choosing Desert Gator Pool Service.  When we bought our house I insisted to my husband that we could take care of the pool...all we needed was someone to come check the chemicals once a month.  Oh sure.  After about one week, mustard algae, a bad storm, and a cranky pool pump, we were looking for a pool guy.We called them on a Saturday and the owner of Desert Gator was kind enough to come to our home at 6:00am the following Monday to fit with our schedules.  We had our service set up that week and have been very happy ever since.  They definitely got our pool under control and taught us quite a bit along the way.  We still have them coming once every week - it's so worth it.  Our pool was in bad shape after a recent storm and they were incredibly responsive.  I think they came two or three times that week without charging us more.$85 per month...but can be a bit more if you need parts and chemicals.~~#~1
I'm sad to report that we dined here for lunch and it was inedible:(  Chef Aaron please come by and monitor your staff.  We had the eggplant sandwich and is was a disaster.  It was so overly oily and the bun and fries overwhelmed the plate.  The shrimp and grits were so average with the shrimp being of low quality.  The beer menu looked fabulous.  So I guess if this is just a watering hole things will be fine...but if you choose to dine be prepared to leave hungry and unsatisfied.  We hope this turns around.  The decor is cool and the staff is really fun and helpful...and we are hopeful for a great place to visit in the "hood".~~#~0
Good ratesGreat location- near food, shoppingQuiet areaRooms have kitchensFree Wifi and BreakfastFor a business traveler these are the big selling points- it's kinda basic but loads of features.~~#~1
Doc and Edwards has been a place of refuge for 5 years for me.  Hell, most of my friends spent their 21st birthday there.  It is hard to explain walking into a bar and just feeling at home.  It is so comfortable and wide open.  Even on the most crowded days, I feel like I am on the cast of cheers.  The employees there are good and the food is exactly what you expect.  You can also order silvermine there with no delivery charge!  The pool table rates have gone up in the last few years but if you spend a good amount of money on drinks, they waive the pool table fee. Or you could go for some ping pong, foosball, UFC, or big buck hunting.  It has a great juke box but watch out for the lady that throws 20 in and slangs the worst playlist I have ever heard. If my girl would only let me, I would have my wedding there.~~#~1
Great gluten free Italian place! Tell all you gluten free friends, they will love you for it!~~#~1
I can't believe some of the things I've been seeing people NAG about in their reviews for this new restaurant! I set my standards pretty high for Rice Paper and they did not disappoint! I took my wife on a date here last night because she really loves beef pho, and had been waiting for this place to open up! The atmosphere was very bright and welcoming, as well was our server! He sat down with us and quickly went over what was good and what was popular with most patrons so far. We took him up on a few of his suggestions and started with the fried calamari. I'm not sure what they bread it with but it was delicious, and the squid was perfect; not too soft, not too chewy!For our main course I ordered the Shaking Beef, which was cubed filet mignon served over onions on a sizzling platter in a special sauce, with a side of rice and grilled zuchinni... again on the suggestion of my server! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND! My wife got the beef pho... at first I was a bit iffy on it because the broth looked very clear as if it were going to be somewhat watery... but it was VERY well seasoned! Our server told us that the broth stews for at least 12 hours allowing it to achieve the best flavor from the pho spices! VERY IMPRESSED! Yes, it is much pricier than your average pho joint, but I'd rather pay a bit extra for a nice, clean and slightly upscale atmosphere! And the quality of the food is MUCH higher than the mystery meat you'll get in your bowl of pho at some other places! Well done Rice Paper, we WILL be back!~~#~1
This is by far the best farmer's market I've been to in the Valley.  Still small by comparison to LA and the Bay Area but is off to a great start with lots of potential and space to grow into.McClendon has a great spread of high quality mainly organic produce and is constantly restocking so it's ok if you don't get there first thing.  It was exciting to see beautiful Tuscan kale and broccoli rabe at prices lower than Sprouts.  Meyer lemons and blood oranges were also available.Phoenician's outstanding loaves were only $3. You're welcome to sample - we particularly liked the Olive Walnut and Dark Chocolate Cherry.We enjoyed Digestif's Frittata ($4) made with thin layers of potato, eggs, pork belly and spinach.  Other combinations available were Dandelion with Goat Cheese and Mushrooms with Garlic Confit. Executive Chef Payton Curry is also there to demonstrate pulling fresh mozzarella which is served with a variety of sauces and toppings,It was fun walking around this bustling market sampling food, like tamales, which we intend to come back for next week.  If I can get myself out of bed at a decent hour on Sat, I'll be here for sure every week until the season ends in May.~~#~1
UNBELIEVABLE!!  so enraged and appalled!!  i took my 91 yr old mom in to the salon for a mani-pedi.  after the pedicure she had the manicure and she asked for french tips.  the GIRL claims she asked mom if she wanted gel nails -- she's 91, did not understand the gal's "english" and can't hear, so i presume she nodded.  after mom paid the charge of $60 and i picked her up (i had another appt.)  she told me about the charge and said she had never paid that much for a mani-pedi.  i called and was told the normal charge is $30 w/$5 added for french and HE said to come back cause it was mistake.  we did and the whole group of technicians said it was mom's fault for saying "yes" and would not concede AT ALL -- not in the slightest.  i found that to be awful and mom felt very taken advantage of.  i will NEVER return there and i caution any hearing-impaired customers to not use this business.  TO ME and of course to mom, it was such a slam on the elderly. mom is a visitor from the east coast and at her age does not need to be treated that way.  VERY BAD BUSINESS!!!~~#~0
Been here 4 times in the past 6 months.  I love bringing out-of-towners here.  Excellent art and history exhibits specifically related to Native Americans from the southwestern United States.  Reasonably priced entrance fee.  Go on the tour - they will tell you really interesting things about each of the exhibits you otherwise wouldn't know - makes the visit much more enjoyable.  A must see for visitors to Phoenix!~~#~1
As you walk in you are greeted by a sign that says Cash Only ATM inside alright times are tough I get it.  Then you see the special board which read "Good Food Takes Time" and there is a clock next to that.  Fine that's cool but the problem is that after waiting for our "good food" it came out and was awful.  My wife said she has tasted better pancakes out of the freezer section at the grocery store.  $30 later we boxed up the food only to throw it away.  The good news is that we went around the corner to the Breakfast Club and had an excellent meal.~~#~0
This review is for the food only.  If you care about parking and what kind of extras they sell that aren't food related you'll have to check out another review.I love LGO.  The food is absolutely top notch and I love how the menu has both traditional fare and a few things you've never heard of like their Venice Beach Burrito which is filled with scrambled eggs, tofu chorizo, spinach, and other goodies.  It comes with a side of salsa which also fantastic.  I eat breakfast here all the time and I have never been disappointed.  Also, if you're in a hurry grab one of their pre-made granola/yogurt/fruit parfaits, Yum!~~#~1
What a great little find especially for Phoenix!  I've been there on at least 4 occasions and have never been disappointed and just had to let everybody know about this little gem!  Recently  I took my mother and we had delicious Singapore Noodles and Malaysian Rice Noodles (which are kind of like Thai's Rad Na but better).  On another occasion my husband ordered Pork Belly Curry and really loved it.  I wasn't as adventurous and had delicious Chicken Kebab Burmese style.  Family owned, quiet, and very affordable.  You have to really look for this place since its in a shopping center(its on the north side of Shea between 70th & 71st St in Scottsdale). Great early bird dinners as well!~~#~1
Absolutely gross-  I'm just going to be bluntly honest- who the F cares what the food tastes like when the place looks like a frickin' dump?  It was so disgustingly dirty inside. Besides food, paper, trash- resting among the carpet- the tables were dirty, the bathroom was out of service and I feared touching anything as I was led to my seat... that's a problem.I've actually never seen such a messy restaurant before. Let me also say that the restaurant was empty when we arrived, and was filthy when we walked in and was filthy when we left. Obviously no one that works at this restaurant cares about cleaning up between seatings. There's no excuse for a place to be disgusting like this. It's downright unsanitary. You serve food Valle Luna, you're a business Valle Luna- keep the place clean for heaven's sake.~~#~0
I was in this area and went here for lunch today based on the Yelp reviews. I had a molete and lengua, fish, and pastor tacos. Washed it all down with a Mexican coke, made an awesome lunch! Everything was so good I ordered a shrimp burrito to go and shared it with a friend after I left. I'll be back to try more things next time I'm in the area!~~#~1
I love me some coffee. The french roast brew is perfect for surviving a long day of work. If you want something sweet, order the iced raspberry mocha. Just the right amount of sweetness without tasting like you're drinking syrup. The muffins are moist and delicious. The spinach salad here is surprisingly amazing (yes, they make spinach salad at this coffee place). The best part about this place? It is not full of hipsters and college students who hog all the decent seating and never leave. I can't wait to go back to try all of the other drinks offered.~~#~1
It isn't often enough that I get to dine at Carlsbad, but last night I decided to have dinner there. I'll be completely honest, service is always a mixed bag. But then you figure when they're crammed to the gills (which is generally how it goes), you can't always expect Speedy freaking Gonzales to be your server. However, last night I don't think I could have sneezed between the time I ordered my food and when it arrived to my table. Excellent.. is all I can say about this joint.If you're looking for some tasty New Mexican fare, get over there!! And if it's packed, let the valet park your car(CUZ ITS FREE)! Start off with a Dos Equis Amber, get some nachos(this vegetarian WILL eat the niblets of chicken in them nachos cuz it's just that tasty) and kick back. Preferably on the patio...because there's a waterfall!!! And if Jacob's working the bar.. expect nothing but the best in cocktails... seriously.~~#~1
This wendy's is terrible. I grew up going to Wendy's but recently the whole chain has become disgusting. This one is just a slow, disgusting chain. Blah, rather eat pretty much any where else.~~#~0
FANTASTIC little lunch/brunch spot! Went here with the family while visiting Scottsdale and really enjoyed it! We had the Tuna Melt, which was delicious with their spiked cottage cheese! The cranberry chicken salad made into a sandwich was DELICIOUS! The omelets and scrambles looks great - I didn't taste, but then again, there was nothing left on the plate! LOL Smaller place so could be busy during peak hours, may call or try and hit an off time. Service was ok, wasn't anything special but the food was really cute and made for a really cute little lunch spot!~~#~1
They wouldn't honor pet co's online sale prices.  That's the first time I've heard about this.~~#~0
Arai pastry is so delicious!ironically i come here not for the sweeties: confections, cakes, cookies, cremes, not being my style- but for their delicious savory treats! The breads they make here are top knotch, the various salty pastries are all worth exploring, the red bean one and the curry filled ones being my favorites. But the real deal, the Coup de grâce, the mamoth reason of what makes this little japanese pastry shop (in my mind) is their sandwhiches/ green tea shakesthat powerful one two punch of savory sagacity is what makes me want to live sometimesyes yesi find the world to be a better place with those items in my tummy~~#~1
I ADORE this place. Matt's has been a staple breakfast, brunch, whatever place for me since I moved to Downtown 5 years ago. They just moved to a great place up the street (where Verde used to be for locals) with more room so now everything isn't so crammed! Not that we all didn't enjoy their original house, this one just says, "I'm still awesome, I just stepped up a notch." Everything is delicious. I love their 5 Spot, the waffles are great, and their lunch specials are always amazing. If you like jelly - try their homemade stuff. Try the bacon.~~#~1
What can I say that hasn't already been said about the food, or the view? I know, I'll share the best part about my amazing birthday dinner at Elements -- meeting Executive Chef Beau Macmillian. He didn't duck away when we made eye contact in the hallway, instead he broke away from his staff and came right up and introduced himself. He was so incredibly personable. He could have easily ignored us. I'm sure he's approached on a regular basis now that he's such a TV personality. But instead, he chatted us up and he talked about how he was so inspired by Asian food and how he wanted to bring that influence into his food and to Arizona. Before we knew it he was taking us in to see the latest renovations to Elements' kitchen! He proudly showed off the latest upgrades. Sure, there were new gadgets, but he even included skylights because his sous chefs said they hated never seeing the light of day. How cool is that?And to be revealed next month is an expansion to the kitchen that includes a table for 12 INSIDE the kitchen. Not a new concept for restaurants, but something Chef Macmillian is so excited about. There's no doubt that the food that he cranks out can be intimidating, but his latest endeavor speaks to his desire of having his guests witness the artistry behind the kitchen doors. This new addition promises to give you a full sensory experience BEFORE the plate even reaches your table -  from seeing, smelling and hearing what's happening in the kitchen to finally tasting the finished product. Talk about mouth watering.    Here's hoping that I will one day get to sit at that table.~~#~1
I love the lakes!  Yes it's a lake in the desert!  Dragon Boat, Outrigger, and Marathons!  It's the place to do it.  Not sure about the fishing part, but I do see people fishing there.  What are they trying to catch hmmm??  I enjoy running there on a nightly basis and so should you.  South side is probably the most scenic, but not to say the North side is bad.  If you're a fellow photographer I would definitely recommend this place during the evenings :)~~#~1
I would give this place NO STARS but Yelp! wants me to give at least one. I went here with my boyfriend last night for dinner and next to our awful Bucca di Beppo (Scottsdale) experience, I have to say, this one is on my list of MOST TERRIBLE restaurant experiences. The service was so bad, we didn't even get to try the food! True Yelper that I am, I did my homework before suggesting that we come here for dinner. I saw all the reviews about the "bad service" , but I paid more attention to the "Cheap" and  "Delicious Pho" reviews because after all, you can't knock it til you've tried it. Yes, the place looks as divey as any food dive gets, yes the place isn't as clean as it probably can be, but hey, all the best pho I've  had (Da Vang, Khai Hoan, Pho Thanh) has been from some of the diviest pho spots in town.  I was excited. It was around 6pm and the place wasn't busy (there were 5 other customers besides us, and 3 of them were on their way out), so we went ahead and sat ourselves down. The server gave us menus, and made her way back behind the cash register. After looking over the menu for less than 2 minutes (I usually go for the spring rolls + everything pho whenever I visit a new spot), we were ready to order. I tried to make eye contact with our server but she seemed to be preoccupied with laughing and talking with the pre-teen sitting behind the counter with her. I finally made eye contact with her, she looked at me and I looked at her, and she turned back to her conversation. For the next 15 minutes I tried to get her attention to alert her that we were ready to order - no luck. But then I noticed that both her and the girl she was talking to were looking over at us and laughing, occasionally pointing in our direction and laughing some more. I wasn't about to give up because I was determined to try some of their well-reviewed food, but after a quarter of an hour spent trying to get their attention with them just laughing and pointing at us, my boyfriend and I had enough. The way they treated us was disrespectful and humiliating, so we walked out and drove across town to another Vietnamese restaurant. We are never going back to this restaurant, and I suggest you don't either. Just as it isn't acceptable for customers to be rude to restaurant staff, it also isn't okay for restaurant staff to be blatantly rude to customers who have not done anything to deserve bad treatment. We did not deserve the type of treatment we got at this restaurant and I am seriously fuming with anger as I write this review. I don't care how delicious and cheap your food is, you cannot use that as an excuse to make customers who come in feel like somehow they are undeserving individuals. Thanks, but no thanks, Pho House. I don't need to feel disrespected and belittled just so I can try your cheap Vietnamese food. I have plenty of Vietnamese friends who have moms who can probably cook better than you can and will treat us a million times better than your staff did last night.~~#~0
Okay,talk about coincidences....The other day I was compli-chatting with fellow yelper Jarvis about hard to find music.Today I run into a past acquaintence while out and about.How do either of these tie into a review of Boom Boom La Rue's?Okay,follow along if you will.So I run into this past acquaintence who's apparently had a bit of a rough week.She tells me about finding this store in the middle of a bad day and it immediately turned her frown upside down.She's raving about it.Then she tells me she has a yelp account and has added a review.I tell her I too have some reviews on yelp.Today I'm in that neck of the woods and so I stop in.Holy hell!This place is a drag queen's delight!It's insanely glitterific and there are beaded dresses and sequined accessories everywhere.Not anything I can personally do anything with,but I did manage to pick up a few things as gifts for friends.And none of it broke the bank.What does this have to do with my convo with Jarvis?A day or so ago we were discussing hard to find music and I brought up Nina Hagen.The sales girl in this store was a DEAD RINGER for Nina Hagen!!!!Flame red spikey hair and clothes right out of 1978 pure punk rock!That took me back to the good old days for sure.She knew the stock,was able to make excellent suggestions by asking specific questions and wasn't the least bit pushy.She was able to attend to  several customers at the same time and created a very social atmosphere for everyone there.For someplace I didn't expect to feel comfortable in,it was a pleasant surprise.While there wasn't anything there I would feel the need to buy for myself,I could see going back again and again to get gifts for friends.A great experience.~~#~1
We took our grandson (Sebastian) to the park for a thoroughly enjoyable visit.  Sebastian wasn't too sure about the carousel, but the train ride put a smile all over his face.  The visit to the Presidential railroad car was fun and educational for the adults.  Sebastian liked it too.~~#~1
So. After 8 years of owning a Ford, it left me stranded on the road one to many times. So I bought a '06 Hyundai Elentra (from a different location). Ive never owned a foreign car, this car appealed to me because of the low miles and still had a warranty. Well....it started to act a little funny. So I called up Discover Hyundai, as they are miles from my work. I spoke to Tim in the service department and he was more then helpful. They had to keep the car for 2 days, because they couldn't get it to do what I was telling them it was doing...but they were persistent and finally were able to duplicate my issue. Everything was under my warranty. I was back on the road by the end of day 2! I will for sure be going back here for all normal maintenance and if any other issues arise. Thanks Tim!~~#~1
I honestly wish I could give this place 0 stars just to keep people out of here- that's how much of a gem my bf and I think this place is. The not only have a more spacious theater, a bar, food beyond the typical nachos and sour patch kids (crappy, but it's there and basically just a bonus in my opinion) but they have 3 flavors of popcorn...3! Holy bajesus- we go for the Carmel popcorn alone. I don't even think we have had the regular or the cheese ever, maybe once. We go out of our way to go there just for that. This place is never that busy which I don't understand. Oh, and another plus, it's not the Tween's hangout on Friday nights. I will admit, we buy the living social or grouping every time we go there ($15 for 2 tix and 1 popcorn), but they already have our business.You idiots who review a place after going to a highly publicized premier like the Hunger Games that you bought with a Groupon are just that...IDIOTS. No one wants to listen to your nitpicking, go to a useless site like Yahoo Local that no one reads so you don't have to make society dumber for listening to your complaining.~~#~1
My dad and I decided to try Great Wall because he had heard many reviews about the place and everyone insisted that you had to come try the Dim Sum.  Since I was in town visiting, it gave us the perfect excuse to go.I'm happy to report that the experience was most excellent at Great Wall and that it lived up to the hype.  Upon getting there, we were given a number to wait as the restaurant was completely full, there were probably 150+ people there dining, however, we were seated within 15 minutes.  As soon as we  sat down, the carts started rolling by with various plates of items to try.The pancake, shu mai, shrimp, duck, and sliced beef inside a wrapper are highly recommended, all were excellent.  I did have a bit of trouble taking the shrimp out of the steam container because their rice wrappers were sticking a bit, but that does happen.I would advise that if you have an allergy to shrimp that you make sure to ask the server what is in some of the items because they do come with shrimp, including their egg rolls.  Since my dad has a shrimp allergy we did have to watch for that.  I did want to try their egg rolls but I would have been the only one eating them, and they were big enough to make a meal in itself.The sliced duck was one of the best I have had at a restaurant, well cooked with crispy tasty skin, and not too many bones to get in the way, and very reasonably priced at $6.25 for a plate.  Most other Dim Sum plates are $2.25 or $3.15 so you can end up eating a lot for a very reasonable price.If you love Dim Sum and are willing to wait a few minutes for a table, but you will get fast service afterward, this really is the place you want to go to.  There are still so many more dishes to try as well, but that will be for another trip.~~#~1
Carlsbad Tavern is my favorite Mexican restaurant. I love the dark and cozy atmosphere inside and I love that they have Hoegaarden on tap.. I've had the machaca burrito and fish tacos here and both dishes were amazing. They serve New Mexico cuisine here. The only difference I noticed is they are big on green chile and use black beans instead of refried beans. I have a lot of friends from New Mexico and they all love this restaurant. The food here is delicious and flavorful if you don't live in the neighborhood it's definitely worth the drive.~~#~1
Very consistent food. Definitely a second best to P.F. Chang's.~~#~1
My wife and i just dined at this restaurant. I am a chef and must say that Chef Chris's concept is one I have not experienced.The food was outstanding, service excellent and the decore was creative,down to the flower pot wine bucket and old wooden crate that it sat on.  Our entrees were served on either a bed of sundried ploenta or baby spincach and blackrice.  What really intrigued me was the slaw made of shredded green papaya that was part of the appetizer course. Being a chef I had to share a neat appetizer, that i recently found, using a baby corn shoot!  Chef keep up the suberb Cafe Monarch Bravo.~~#~1
I am very particular about where I go for sushi.  I can name ten places I will not go to, and have struggled to find a place to frequent; until now.  I have only been here about 5 times, but every time was a great experience.  Great food, staff, prices,and atmosphere.~~#~1
My trip was inspired by Adam Richmond's visit and while I couldn't do the 12 slider challenge, I knocked out 5 and was close to taking on a 6th.The GM stopped by to check on us and the waitress was great! Be sure to grab some fresh baked deli treats before heading out.~~#~1
Wine, booze and cigars. And friendly staff. There's not much else that needs to be said. Oh and great prices.The selection and prices they offer are great. The aisles are wide and clearly marked. The cigar room has a great selection as well and the prices are low.~~#~1
Any time I have out of town visitors who want "real" Mexican, I take them here. The chips are fresh, the salsa is divine, and after downing two baskets, you realize you need to eat an entree! I've eaten a variety off the menu, and nothing has disappointed me. The burros are stuffed full, the crisps are mouthwatering and the enchiladas melt in your mouth.The ONLY downside is the location. Just not a great part of town, though they are trying very hard to revitalize it. Go there anyway! Just try lunch time first.~~#~1
Okay, did I say bad??WORSE.Negative five stars.From San Diego,1. they made us wait in line for ticketing.2. Made us go check our bags3. Bag agent told us the flight has been delayed 35 min and we have to wait in the "special needs" line bc we were gonna miss our connection flight. 4. Booked another flight. Meanwhile got barked at my a brainless, incompetent, mean lady that was a complete b*tch to us.She told us there was plenty of time for our next flight and that we should patiently stand in line (and miss that flight).5. Got on the runway. Plane circled around for about an hour. didn't take off.6. "mechanical problems".7. kept ppl on the plane for another hour.8. kicked everybody off saying we weren't taking off on this plane.9. made everybody wait in a long@$$ line that didn't move while we saw a ticketing agent to rebook our flight (while I held up a DELTA SUCKS sign made with pen and crayon on my sketchbook)10. hours later after not knowing what to do with us, they placed us in a hotel in downtown SD.11. We were to take an 8 PM flight the next day to LAX and then 2 hr and 45 min layover.12. 11:45 PM plane from LAX to Tokyo.... scheduled 4 AM landing in the far east, you kidding me? 13. THEY LOST MY LUGGAGE. ~~*~*~*~*~*~*~* another incident:LAX to Tokyo: "mechanical problems"stayed another hour on the plane.Had them shuttle us to a hotel in the middle of nowhere.Lost luggage on the way there. It fell out of a bus!Next morning, 8 AM plane to Busan, Korea.Seriously, you expect me to go to work on Monday after all this sh*t?!Sorry Delta, I'm so exhausted, sick and tired of you.F*CK YOU guys and your incompetence and sh*tty customer service  too.~~#~0
I grew up in Arizona and we went to Wongs every Sunday after church.  Three years ago we got stationed in Hawaii.  Everytime I come home, our first stop is Wongs.  I love everything about it.  Wongs is my comfort food.~~#~1
An upscale mexican restaurant in the area seemed like the best thing to have happened to me. I planned my visit for a quieter evening, and reviewed the menu again and again. However, upon our arrival I thought twice immediately. The parking was iffy, and the place didn't seem to stand up to the signage. Perhaps the art was not to my liking, honestly not a piece stands out in my memory. We were seated immediately. Our waiter seemed a little off, not to mention the fact that he was insanely snobby and seemed to be moonlighting in the kitchen, where he disappeared for 10-15 minutes at a time. He did not fill our soft drinks once without being first flagged down (those of you who have experienced the close quarters will understand how ridiculous this is). Halfway through waiting for our food (which took 45 minutes, easily), the lamp above our table went out. We sat in the dark for a good 5 minutes before they even noticed. Which was actually a nice change of scenery from the boring beige walls. When the food finally arrived, we were too tired (due to having finished an entire bottle of wine) so we left. Unfortunately, we took our grub with us.I had some sort of mixed seafood entree with chorizo and a creamy sauce. It's no coincidence you're taken aback by the combination... it didn't go down too easily. Having dropped 90 dollars on the meal, though, we felt compelled to finish as much as we could stand. Normally I would make sure I got the name of the dish right, but since I am recommending that you not go there, why bother?~~#~0
This is the ONLY place my wife and I will buy furniture from, absolutely fantastic!My wife and I spent a better part of a month looking for a TV stand for our living room. Everything we came across was cheap and prefabricated. We stumbled on Sweet Potatoes while on our way home from another local store. The owner was extremely friendly and helpful.  We found a couple things we liked but not the size we needed.  The owner told us the pieces we were looking at are locally made and offered to call and see if they could custom make one. Not only did they agree but the price we were given was 200 dollars less than anything else we were looking at.  We have since received the piece and could not be happier!~~#~1
My brother from San Francisco was in town and missing the sushi from the bay area. I decided I'd let him choose where we'd go out even though I'd never ever heard of this place before. It was definitely in a not-so-glamorous area, tucked on the side of a dinky shopping center (sorry shopping center). When we walked in I was pleasantly surprised by the quaint atmosphere and set-up. It's definitely small but everyone working there and eating there seemed to be genuinely having a great time. We sat at the bar/long table in front of the sushi chefs which was a fun experience. We started off with sake, and it was pretty darn smooth. We ordered a variety of different dishes including sea urchin eggs, yellowtail shashimi and the king crab roll. They were even accomodating to make my brother dishes that weren't on the menu. The chefs are so nice and fun and the prices are pretty good!My brother was extremely impressed coming from a top sushi city. I look forward to coming back and trying more of their extensive menu, especially for happy hour.~~#~1
I love Taste Of China. I eat here at least once a week. Their menu is pretty big and the prices are small. Also, they are incredibly fast. If order for pick-up, it's ready in 5 minutes. Should I order delivery, it only takes 10-15 for the food to get to my house. My favorite plates are the crab puffs and the General Tso's chicken.~~#~1
Have been there several times. I'm quite fussy about where I eat and quick to condemn, so my continued custom says it all.~~#~1
You'll feel like you stepped in a time machine and landed in 1987.  The decor hasn't been updated in at least 20 years.  Looks like it's falling apart.  The TVs are mostly 80s style TVs as well, although there are a couple flat screens as well.  This is where the trash hangs out, of all colors.  The pizza was greasy (which I like) but also chewy (which was gross).  The wings were drowned so much in sauce you couldn't find them.  Might as well get a glass of honey bbq sauce and drink it straight.  Service was interesting.  The guy that worked there was wearing capri pants and had a higher voice than my girlfriend.  The price wasn't bad- I think it was like $22 for a large pizza, wings and 2 sodas.  I'd rather pay a little bit more and just go to Upper Crust pIzza down the street.~~#~0
First, I'm sorry this review is lengthy, but i really want people to understand how far a little kindness can go. I entered Mimi's Cafe at the end of possibly worst day ever. I came in looking to order food for takeout and get home to drown my sorrows in comfort food. i was directed by the hostess up front to go stand by the bakery and i would be able to order take out. i waited not 15 seconds and was greeted with a huge smile from a lovely girl named Danielle. She gave me a menu and told me to ask if i had questions and inquired if i had been there before. i looked at the menu for some time, unable to clear my mind enough to decide. She told me i was welcome to take a seat, and when i apologized for taking so long she responded with a smiley "where's the fire? take your time, can i get you a glass of wine while you decide?" wine was a perfect idea! I finally ordered and sat drinking my wine. i waited, and then waited a little longer, Danielle the young girl doing take out informed me the kitchen was working as fast as they could but are very busy, she apologized for the wait and offered complimentary bread  and convinced me to buy a a second glass of wine. When she brought me the second glass i had just gotten off the phone and was visibly shaken with more bad news. Somehow this young girl had the courage to ask if everything was alright and what she could do to help. It was just the olive branch i needed. Just the inquiry was enough to make me feel better. i told her i was fine and thanked her for her compassion. finally my food was ready. She boxed everything with care for the drive home. All this time smiling. i couldn't help but notice Danielle interact with the other employees they always laughed or high fived her with each exchange. She had brightened my day, and it was clear she is a light for others in Mimi's Cafe. This is the kicker...my bill was $30 and some change...i gave her what i thought was two $20 dollar bills, but in reality was a $50 and a $20. The young girl ran outside and stopped me saying sir, I'm not sure these bills are right. i was overwhelmed by her honesty and told her no, i thought they were two 20's but the difference would be her reward for honesty. The food was tasty and just what i needed. Mimi's Cafe is a friendly place worth the wait for food or a table, and if Mimi's Cafe reads these reviews know that you have a superstar in Danielle.~~#~1
This is quite literally the best burger I have ever eaten. The rocket bacon cheeseburger with 3 patties of meat on a 10 in. sesame sub roll and is nothing short of amazing. It could easily be shared. The cheese fries and onion rings are homemade. We love the casual environment and the huge selection of glass bottled soda. To top it off the prices are amazing! This is our first time here but we are hooked. We would love to see this place on Diners, Drive-In's and Dives, DDDinfo@mac.com, so if you love it here, nominate it!~~#~1
A real gem!~~#~1
Unprofessional, disorganized, and extremely low end care.~~#~0
Should be called The Bad Egg. Bottom line, the hotel's free breakfast tasted better than this and we got better service there. We arrived around 945am on a Sunday morning and had to wait around seven minutes to be seated. The staff was pleasant enough. We were seated, given menus with water and she took our order for coffee and the breakfast special (loaded potato skillet). We sat for 15 minutes before we saw our waitress again. She finally figured out she forgot to bring our coffee. We finally got some coffee which was mediocre in flavor. Our food arrived about ten minutes after that. The skillet was supposed to contain sausage, bacon, onion, scrambled eggs, grilled american potatoes covered with cheese and sour cream. Mine had no bacon, two tiny chunks of sausage, no cheese, and the potatoes were so soggy, they tasted like someone had thawed them and thrown them in as an afterthought. It was so unpalatable i could not eat more than one bite, even after loading it up with salt and hot sauce. The waitress never checked on us once during the meal. She came back by the time my husband was finished. I told her the meal was horrible (in a nice way). She offered me something else. By that point, I was not feeling like eating anything else, I felt kinda sick. My meal was comped and we did get an apology. The manager explained that everyone LOVES that special and the potatoes are seasoned and grilled. The cook obviously didn't try my potatoes. Blech. Even with the comp, the total was over $15 for one special and two coffees. Very hight priced for nasty food, poor service, and loud/uninspiring atmosphere.~~#~0
We went on a Friday night and even though it is off season here, the place was packed. Never the less, the service was impeccable as always. This is our third trip here and we have never been disappointed. I had the 14 Oz. NY strip and my wife had the prime rib. Both were cooked to perfection and seasoned ever so  wonderfully! My wife tells me the horseradish is the real deal and not the runny stuff you get elsewhere...can't vouch as I hate the stuff.  From the bread to the desert, every bite was worth taking. The old time ambiance with the dark wood and red "leather"? booths are welcoming. It's pricey and if you can ignore the geek with khakis, no socks and deck shoes ever so gently cradling his wine...(you KNOW the guy and he is everywhere) in the middle of a Phoenix summer, it is worth every single cent.~~#~1
So, not following my own advice (ahem, NEVER RETURN), I returned here for a friend's birthday dinner a few months ago (I super love this person so how could I say no?). HA! Big mistake. Also, fair warning: there are several-a-CAPS-LOCK ahead.The only pleasant thing about the evening was the reservation and seating were right on time for our large group (15 people). And of course because we were celebrating a super special person.I'll keep this update short and sweet:$3 for a CAN OF SODA? Get real. I knew it'd be overpriced but I was at least expecting a mini bottle or something. But a can? COME ON. You bought that in bulk and paid .03342 cents for it. FAIL.Your servers: IDIOTS. First it takes our server 15 minutes to come around the first time and take drink orders. Then she's back another 15 minutes after that taking the orders again. Did you forget? Were you not paying attention the first time we around? Why did it take 30 minutes just to order drinks? And on top of that we wait another 15 to receive them. FORTY-FIVE MINUTES TO RECEIVE DRINKS IS BAD. Very, very bad. Also, not taking food orders until after we've been seated for ONE HOUR is BAD. VERY, VERY BAD. Seated at 8 o'clock, we didn't receive our food until almost TEN O'CLOCK. TWO HOURS FOR FOOD IS VERY, VERY BAD. Do you hear that, St. Francis? BAD.Because I loathed the place even before this lovely birthday dinner, and because the thought of supporting such an establishment makes my blood boil, I ordered only dessert and the hubs ordered an appetizer (and add on a $3 can soda). Funny, that our bill was still nearly $30 for the both of us. Excluding tip. BAD.Also, server: If you say you're not going to split a check, stick to your word or don't even try. Now, I'M glad you didn't stick to your stingy "I don't split checks", because I could foresee the mess of trying to split a $700 bill with 13 people I didn't know so well. Lucky for us, when we told you we were leaving early and asked for our check, you split it for us. A couple others caught on and did the same, but the remaining 7-8 people were not so lucky. Because I realize my short and sweet is not so short anymore (or sweet, for that matter), I'm ending it here. NOTE TO SELF: heed own advice and stay away from St. Francis!~~#~0
SOOOOOOOOO MUCH FUN! The 3 of us went to Superstition Farm for their tour last Saturday. No, we didn't have any kids with us but we may have had a better time than most of the kids.The beginning is a bit dry. You're in the "classroom" for a while learning about random facts related to diary cows.  Moo.  After that, it's a hay ride.  Girls, let me give you one tip - Make sure you wear long pants or shorts that are long.  Hay is very uncomfortable under your butt if there isn't enough padding.  Anyway, the hay ride was entertaining but the best part had yet to come.Once the hayride was over, the "tour" was officially over.  But everyone stuck around to check out the petting zoo. The animals were all so friendly and we got to feed them as well.  There was a hodgepodge of creatures from a young cow to sheep to rabbits and even a turkey.  Yum...just kidding.In addition, there's a black lab on the premise that was amazing.  This dog would make an incredible soccer player.  His reaction time is unbelievable - any team would be happy to have him as a goalie.After the animal bonding, we went to try flavored milk.  Mine was butterscotch flavored and it was just ok.  I was disappointed that the milk wasn't fresh from the farm but I guess it's not legal to serve unprocessed milk.  Since we had a Groupon, we also had a chance to try Udder Delights ice cream. At $2.50 each, I would never pay for them individually. But seeing that it was included in my "deal," we enjoyed them a lot.Don't be embarrassed if you don't have kids.  Trust me, adults can enjoy Superstition Farm too.~~#~1
I love going to this store whether its for just for the latest copy of guitar world, some strings, or a new guitar, the guy johnny is my main man lol he always gives me good deals and generally makes me and any one else i take there feel like we are the only customers, (in a good way!) every one remembers you and asks you how your day is going great "mom and pop" feel.~~#~1
95 reviews? Guess there's nothing I can say about this gem that hasn't been said. We ordered the cheese pizza which is a really inexpensive but delicious tasting Margarita pizza sooo good. We also had the vodka penne with tender big pieces of rendered bacon, tomatoes and fresh basil. The vodka sauce was creamy and seasoned very well. They included a ton of grilled french bread and cutlery because they knew I was staying at a hotel. They were really sweet and very fast at getting all that food ready for us. It says on their website and on the yelp search engine that Pizza A Metro delivers but they don't. Not a big deal though the food is totally worth going to get yourself.~~#~1
Love love love this place.  Tasty with great prices... who can beat that?  My newest thing is to order a gyro-to-go and enjoy it at home.  I'm a mom now so eating at a restaurant is a lot harder than it used to be. hahaSee ya there!~~#~1
When I get the urge to eat out, I'm normally drawn to more laid back restaurants where I can sit back, chat, and enjoy my meal.  With a relaxing atmosphere and fun menu (Chicken & Waffles, and S'mores for dessert), I definitely enjoyed this place.  My first time here was for a Yelp event so I was able to try just about everything.  My favorites would have to be the mac & cheese and the beef brisket--both delicious!  I'd say they've got their BBQ technique mastered, at least where the brisket is concerned.  And the cornbread is probably the best I've had--so happy they handed out the recipe at the event.  The service was great; everyone was friendly and very helpful.  I was satisfied with everything here and definitely would come back--and probably leave with tasty leftovers!~~#~1
The place did not disappoint. The moment we stepped through the archway, my friends and I were bedazzled by the ambience throughout the area. It really DOES feel like a tavern, almost like something out of Pirates of the Caribbean (Well.. kind of)But yeah, the portions were overwhelming, and best of all? The food was spectacular. I sat outside, but honestly? I think the place is pretty both ways, so don't be too stingy on the location :)Jus go.~~#~1
They get 5 stars for the only thing I have ever had there. Every single time I have to get the Pizza Nortena. It is out of this world. It is meant to be an appetizer but we get it to go and have it for dinner.~~#~1
This dude claims he "steals souls for a living" and is "the best photographer". In the world. Ever.  http://www.flickr.com/people/tysoncrosbie/I promise--there is nothing at all vain, hacky, narcissistic, overpriced or arrogant, whatsosever, about Tyson Crosby or his work.Phoenix should consider itself fortunate to be home to such a phenomenally over-talented, artistic genius.  Big art cities like NYC, Chicago and LA would never be able to fully appreciate the photographic brilliance of the one, the only, the premier best photographer in the world-Tyson Crosby.Humble, poetic and unpretentious as he may be, I can't argue with him. The fist time I saw a Tyson Crosbie image, I j!zzed in my pants. Really, his work is that good. For real. No joke. I'm serious. Totally serious.  I love his work so much, I want to marry a Tyson Crosby print.Where is the button for 5 million stars?!!!~~#~1
Vegetarian/Vegan south Indian buffet!  Guilt free conscience! What more could a girl want? I am in LOVE with the dosas.  I always wish I had a larger tummy to accommodate all the delicious food. Udupi is proof that being vegan/vegetarian can be tasty and cruelty-free. Humble ambiance, no fancy decorations.~~#~1
Wood fired pizzas, scrumptious pasta dishes and bacon wrapped shrimp.  How can you go wrong with a place that wraps things in bacon.  C'mon, even  veggies admit that things wrapped in bacon are good!  Has a smokey atmosphere and a slight bar crowd but the food is outstanding.~~#~1
I give this location no love.  We went to this one rather than the one uptown on a Saturday night with a voucher from another location from a bad sushi upchuck experience.  Going late at night with a mostly empty restaurant, we still ended up waiting 10 minutes to be sat, then SHOVED and I mean shoved in next to the only other table in the place - the hostess snickered at me when I kindly asked to move a single table down (really sick of bitchy hostesses in Scottsdale by the way - your job is not that hard so shut up and color for christs sake)  Our waitress took another 10 minutes just to greet us, sushi took forever, and if you can believe it the fun hadnt even begun yet.  When paying the bill, we present the voucher to the waitress, who says she cant take it.  The manager came over with a bitchy look, basically trying to call it bull shyt and continued to give us the 5th degree about it for the next few minutes - certainly NOT appreciated.  She takes it to the point where she calls the other location where we got it (taking ANOTHER 10 minutes) and finally gives us our bill back - only taking off our 2 rolls and 2 nigiri.  This created one pissed off yelper instantaneously.Don't bother with this location - you could find bomb shrapnel in your soup and they still wouldnt give a damn.  And for the sake of all that is holy - STOP WITH THE CRAZY I'M-TOO-SEXY-FOR-MYSELF SCENE!  YOU'RE NOT THAT COOL!~~#~0
Dr Norton and his staff are friendly and professional. They have made my 3 children feel relaxed and comfortable. I highly recommend this office.~~#~1
This speakeasy was kickass. The staff is super down to earth and the menu is great. The drive thru is an awesome touch. I got the Turkey Club and it was reallllllly good. We received 2 randomly free samples of a shake and smoothie and had some good conversation with the guys behind the counter. It gets a little noisy if they're makin shakes in there, and the seating is pretty limited. I wish they were open later but so far I'm loving it!~~#~1
Qver-priced, substandard food.  Never met a cheeseburger I didn't like-- until now, (NOT a 1/2 lb.).   Small portions of tired, room temperature "fry-pieces",  burnt bacon, chicken tenders so hard, they couldn't be penetrated with a fork.  Mediocre service;  didn't bring kids meal cookie.  Waste of $$$!~~#~0
What was Dunkin Donuts thinking when they took out the selection of donuts and now only offer a choice of 10.  It used to be you couldn't decide which one to get, now you just have to settle for what they have.  This new and improved Dunkin Donuts is the worst.  I will return for coffee when I get the urge...but never for a donut!!  Oh and another thing...my Dunkin Donuts used to have Baskin Robbins inside...that is gone too...again WHAT WERE THEY THINKING!~~#~0
Love the food here.  Been here a few times and got the peanut curry twice and been delish.  Thai iced tea was great as well.  Only been there during lunch and everything seems pretty good so far.  Went with coworkers and family and they all loved it too.  Service was fast, prompt and nice.  Will be back again to try other dishes.~~#~1
Unique selection of antiques, linen and assorted pictures and estate jewlery along with new timeless designs. Located in downtown Gilbert worth the trip!~~#~1
Honestly the best part of this place is the unbelievable deal you can get on pet related products. Because they are one of the primary income sources for HALO Animal Rescue, people that have pets, tend to make donations. You can almost always find pet carriers for under $10. They have dog crates for training and you don't have to shell out a fortune for them. They have fish tanks that will allow you to let little Johnny get his feet wet in the world of pet care and the associated responsibilities without breaking the bank. If you are a person that shares your life with animals, you understand the rarity of these kinds of deals!Yes they have clothes, furniture, tchatchkies, etc., but the real deals are on the pet products.As a side note, HALO recently leased the MCCAC location at 5231 North 35th Avenue (It was the previous Maricopa County run cat adoption center). So if you are looking for a companion (cat or dog), check them out and support one of the fastest growing no-kill efforts in the US.http://www.halorescue.org/index.html~~#~1
My wife and I went to Harris Dental for a few years when we lived in Scottsdale.  We moved out of town in 2009 but we have never forgotten the superb dental care that we received from Dr. Joe Harris (who had come highly recommended from our Austin, TX dentist as a person who keeps up wth dental research).  Nor have we forgotten the fabulous and uniformly cheerful staff.  So it wasn't really too surprising that we received a call from Harris Dental a few days ago - more than three years after we moved away - asking for permission to archive our dental x-rays and asking where they might send funds from a credit to our account.  Who does that?~~#~1
We bought or second Jura Compressa coffee machine from Sur La Table.  It was an expensive model priced over $3K.  After 2.5 short months it stopped working.  The only  option they offered was to send it in for repair.  When I asked to have it replaced I was told the turn around was 48 hours.  Its actually 4 -5 weeks when all is said and done.  I high priced item and thats the kind of customer service. Not to mention an expensive product that cant make it 90 days.  Extremely bad customer service on this one.~~#~0
I'm completely impressed by The Mission and I can't wait to go back and try more of their amazing food.  My husband and I chose The Mission for our 8th Anniversary dinner and had a wonderful time - the staff is extraordinarily knowledgeable and very warm & welcoming.  Yelp steered us in the right direction as per usual, so we split the cheese plate with manchego to start, the pork shoulder tacos for dinner and split a pumpkin bread pudding for dessert.  Everything was expertly prepared and delicious.  The bread pudding was EASILY the best I've ever had.  We usually don't order desserts and I'm glad we did, because I can't stop thinking about how amazing this was.  My husband had an Avocado Margarita and an Estrella beer (Awesome that they have this available - and it was even served in an Estrella glass - impressive).  Since I'm pregnant, I asked if the bartender could make me a virgin version of their "Sophia Loren" with fresh strawberries & mint - score!  It was delicious and I'll certainly be back to try it with the proper amount of booze :)  Lastly, how amazing is that Himalayan Salt Brick wall????  I NEED this in my house!~~#~1
a G Spot is a myth.  and Dr Graffenberg was a mad scientist.So its no surprise that I couldn't find the Gelato Spot either.  Shannon spouts, "I love gelato so much, I would bathe in it".  Hmmm, that's interestingI drove in and around the dirt road... and went up and down Scottsdale ... explored the box... looked south of the landing strip at Scottsdale Airpark... manually googled it... orally asked the passerbysRoad several times and I couldn't find it ANYWHEREMaybe I need to do more research.  Perhaps some field research...Or a targeted focus group*** UPDATE  ***Its on Shea Blvd??  No wonder I couldn't find it-I was looking down the wrong road*** UPDATE  ***Thanks Jake P for "Yeah it is on Shea, in the strip mall area east of scottsdale rd near the Harkins Theater and Pita Jungle and such.... "BUT the point of this review was sarcasm.  i.e. g- spot is hard to find*** UPDATE  ***Now I have a girl, "Shannon W", telling me where g-spot is.  She writes, "It's on 74th St. and Shea, in between Coffee Plantation and Pita Jungle."Shannon W:  The point of this review was sarcasm.  i.e. g-spots are hard to find~~#~1
THis place is great! I need an adjustment every now and then but I live in Scottsdale and my regular Chiropractor is so good that he is always booked up ahead of time, so if I tweek my back unexpectedly I can't get in soon enough quite often. So.. now I have a place to go seven days a week that is every bit as good as my normal Chiro. I have only gone to the weekend chiro but my wife and one of my employees have seen Dr. Brian and they love him. So if you need a good Chiro... go see these guys any day of the week. Try em you'll love em!~~#~1
What are you all talking about?! This place is awful. Theres a reason why these sandwiches are $3. I can't believe so many people like this place, (although the place was filled with the Chinese people and they have been known to have different taste buds ) You get a 10 inch piece of bread with a bunch of stringy cheap vegetables. From what they said, there was meat on there too,  however i forgot to bring my microscope to verify if there was any on there. This place is like a middle school cafeteria smack dab in the heart of Tokyo's slums (i don't know any Vietnamese cities). Please, homeless people, save your quarters, you're too good for this place. They have good milkshakes, but if you really are homeless (as you should be if you're going to Lee's) you shouldn't be buying "rich people" milk shakes anyways, stick with the dollar menu.~~#~0

Good JIB. Fast an friendly.~~#~1
I LOVE this place! From the moment you walk up to the door, it is spotless. Sometimes you will be approached by an employee asking if you need assistance, majority of the time, you won't talk to one employee, which is great! I just want to go in, get what I need, and peace out until next time without the small chatter. Their hummus is AMAZING, along with a few of the prepackaged meals. Their Creamy Cilantro Salad Dressing is OMG AMAZING!!Sweet tea... LOVE IT!!~~#~1
This place is great for a big group of people. We originally thought we were going to have 6 people. We ended up having 11 by the time everyone showed up. The staff was more than happy to accommodate us. The Kota Athenian chicken is very good. The price range is moderate. All in all a fantastic place.~~#~1
Dr Natalie is a compassionate, empathetic, caring DC. She listens, takes her time with you and always strives not only to make you feel better, but to keep you feeling better. Her new location is adorable. I highly recommend her!~~#~1
I must hand it to them at Olive and Ivy! First rate atmosphere and food.The pesto is the most flavorful I have ever had and that includes pesto I have eaten in Italy.Wine selection is terrific. The breakfast, lunch and dinners are wonderful. The bar feels a bit like a meat market but that is the only down side.It is beautiful, clean and worth returning to again and again.~~#~1
OK, Where do I start?This place is AMAZING! I love the food here, especially the fact that you can eat and watch a movie at the same time! Forget about the movie theater popcorn, you can get a rack of ribs here while enjoying your movie!Before the movie starts, a waiter walks around with an iPod touch taking your order, usually during the previews. During the movie, you can press the Service Light to add more things to your order. About nearing the end of the movie, you will get your check, so make sure that if you want more food, get your orders in before the movie is over.Pricing is good, it costs about the same as  a dinner and a movie separately, why NOT kill two birds with one stone and get it all at once? The seats are REAL COMFORTABLE, as long as you get the love seat, or leather seats, just don't get the "office chair" seats, as those are like....sitting in an office chair for 3 hours watching a movie ;).~~#~1
I've been in a handful of times, and last night was also no disappointment. After looking for a place to have a glass of wine late, I ended up here, as 3 or 4 other places in Old Town were either closed (Napoleon's and Tapas Papas Fritas both closed at 11 PM??? Well, Napoleon's closed forever, so I heard, but won't believe...) or dead. Citizen had a multi-course private affair they were finishing up. Kazimierz had some kind of themed jazz party going and was raucous and demanded a cover charge. But good ol' cosmopolitan-cool AZ88 was next on my list, where I had a fantastic Pinot Noir (and Tempranillo), cheese plate (their kitchen stays open till 12:30 every night), and warm and friendly convo with spot-on bartender Steen. Another bartender came in later and was relating his favorite summer drinks in a bon vivant fashion. They do have a killer Moscow Mule which is served in a copper tankard to keep it cool. I've been coming in here, on average maybe once or twice a year since around 2007, and let me say at AZ88 the good things don't change. They still have a tantalizing food menu (they are a full boar upscale restaurant), and a drink menu that, together, rival anything else, really, in Lower Scottsdale (and in much of the Valley). Not to mention the atmosphere that for me has the perfect combination of sophistication, decor, music (4 more stars for the DJ's mellow-ambient rhythms) service, and vibe that indulges all the senses wonderfully. I'm now making this place my default destination for treating myself or a date like VIPs, as they've shown what it takes to to be among the best at what they do.~~#~1
This place is pure crap! The players are sub-par and un-entertaining,  (especially Mike Clement and Julie Martinez).  , and the door men are ridiculously cheesy, and rude. I'm a regular at piano bars all over the country when I'm traveling (Pete's Piano Bar in Austin, Howl At The Moon in Scottsdale) and The Big Bang in Tempe is a terrible destination. Save your tips and bar $ for the aforementioned places and take my word for it.~~#~0
If we hadn't arrived after a tiring day and prepaid online, I would have checked out.  Furniture missing.  Security bar sheared off.  Faceplates for wiring gone.  Furniture handles missing.  Bobby pins and scraps of things on carpet - hadn't been vacuumed.  Two remaining chairs badly stained.  You wouldn't want to sit on them.  No uniforms or name tags on staff.  Pick another chain.  The reviews for the other Ramada's in the area - which I read after the fact - reflect the same things.~~#~0
WOW.  This places is incredible.  I can honestly say that everything on the menu is wonderful.  It's the perfect date place, since you can order booze to cure the date jitters.  Also, you can satisfy your dieting girlfriend and still order a big plate of "man food".  The best part about their menu is the fact that it is SO TASTY with being HEALTHY.  The extra care in picking ingredients, grilling/cooking with little fats, and unique spice combinations truly makes PJ stand out.  The decor's nod to local artists also helps make the dining room an enjoyable place to be.  For a perfect healthy and satisfying vegetarian lunch I recommend the following:  A small Greek salad with an order of the jalapeño or roasted red pepper hummus (PS:  they'll let you order the hummus half and half!)~~#~1
Still a place that is unacceptable in my book--especially when a server there goes out of their way to message me privately on Yelp to complain about my punctuation, and signing off--every so "sincerely" i might add, with: " love the B*tchy waitress from AZ88.Way to keep it classy over there.....~~#~0
I am from New York and always asked where do I get best pizza? Hands down Lamps Pizzeria is the BEST!!!!!!  Always fresh ingredients and friendly staff and owner.~~#~1
Hertz Gold Club service worked perfectly for me. My Toyota Corolla, booked over the internet, was in its bay and ready to go.The buses to and from the rental centre were frequent and painless to use.~~#~1
Umm this place is awesome. I got a bike basket for 25 cents. 25 cents! Too often these days I run into "thrift" stores that miss the thrifty part, but not this one! It's fun to shop and you may end up finding a truly good deal!~~#~1
I work right down the street from Press and have been a huge fan from my very first visit! The staff is unbelievably friendly and extremely passionate about their craft! Everything from the food to the coffee is first rate! They always accommodate my special requests (a little more of this, none of that) and always make good suggestions when I'm looking for something new. I love the yogurt and granola parfait (strawberry and vanilla yogurt for me with a bit of honey and light granola) for breakfast with a white chocolate latte. Also, the breakfast burritos are perfectly creative and filling. For lunch, my favorite is the cactus club panini with a small side salad. Also worth mentioning is that they have the VERY BEST iced coffee around. They call it an iced toddy and any one of the employees would be happy to tell you how it is different from regular coffee. I just know that it tastes amazing and seems to have a bit more of a caffeine kick!  My favorite part about Press are their delectable desserts! The berry mascarpone cake pretty much makes you feel like you've won the lottery. And the ghirardelli brownies and chocolate chip cookies (warmed up) are a weekly addiction of mine.  Starbucks is a thing of the past. I'm lucky to be in close proximity to Press, but I think I would even make the drive just for that mascarpone cake!~~#~1
I have used Sandella's on three different occasions for catering lunches to business offices. Jeff ( owner) does a fantastic job at not only running a great business but also with the quality of food he prepares for customers and excellent customer service and catering as well. My offices that I bring lunch to love this food fare. It is a healthy alternative that many of my offices are craving after having so many lunches brought to them that weigh them down and make them feel like going to sleep after lunch. As a part of our healthcare community this food is something I feel confident about bringing to my colleges and offices that I visit. It taste great, it is made with only the best ingredient personally selected by Jeff and it is best of all , healthy.~~#~1
I stumbled across this place after missing my usual Light Rail stop on my way to pick up a Zipcar at the downtown ASU campus.First I tried my usual caffeine fix...a nonfat double latte. Excellent.Second trip back, I gave the breakfast burrito (plus bacon) a try. Delicious. The tortilla was as good as everything inside.Third trip, a beet salad and a bacon chocolate chip cookie. Bacon and chocolate for the win!I've been here three times and have not been disappointed. The decor is modest, but functional, as it should be at a good business with honestly good food. The barista is not only knowledgable and skilled, but is also a genuine sweetheart.It's just a couple of blocks from the Jefferson and First Street Light Rail stop (East bound), so I've been stopping by on my way to work.~~#~1
great wine selection except they are always out of greg norman and ive never got to try it~~#~1
Great fruit and vegetables. Bulk items like nuts and cranberries are a good value. Check out the meat and deli. Cage free chicken and grass fed beef. Salmon and Tuna are fresh. They do have some good values here. The cashiers are good and give the nickel bag discount.~~#~1
I like their seating area. It has a nice sized inside area and also a bright outside area that is tucked between a walkway and another store. One of my favorite locations.~~#~1
As a real estate investor, I need contractors that I can truly count on to get things done for me.  This means that my calls get returned in a timely fashion, work is done properly, quickly and competently but most importantly, that I get quoted a fair price for a good job.  Don't give me drama and definitely, don't give me any bullshit excuses or sales pitches.I'm so glad to have found David and Tracy.  They run a tight ship, they are extremely professional and I sensed their sincerity from the word hello and I talk to contractors and real estate agents almost every single day.Thank you for a job well done.  You have definitely made the cut as part of my go to crew, not only for my rental properties but as a highly recommended vendor to my Sonoran desert friends, colleagues and neighbors.Cheers!!~~#~1
I understand I'm not dude and so I'm not there to state at your "twin peaks" however, that being said I am there to buy a beer and when it takes the bartender 20 minutes just to get a beer I'm over it. So I was never gonna come back but was forced with a group of friends who wanted to eat and was just as upset as the first time. Fries were soggy and our server disappeared. We all decided were not going back. Just because your a good looking server doesn't give you an excuse for sucking.~~#~0
It's 1961 and we're having lunch in the courtyard of our Miami Beach hotel. Parker House rolls, sweet and salty, an open-face meatloaf sandwich with mushroom gravy. There's a surf board and a tiki carving amidst the flowers. But wait - something's wrong!! There's no humidity! Those are imported mushrooms in my gravy! I work to orient myself in time and space and find, what a relief, that I'm actually in Cafe ZuZu in downtown Scottsdale and it's 2010. The Valley Ho Resort, which houses the Cafe, is such a wonderful period piece. It opened in 1956 and was renovated in 2005 by a very wise design team that left the mid-century architecture and spirit intact. Cafe ZuZu is at the far end of the lobby, and its charming patio is surrounded with flowers. The decor is late 50's. If you're as old as we are, you'll recognize it instantly. The menu consists of "Flavorful American comfort food. Familiar favorites with a contemporary twist." There are goodies like warm Maytag blue cheese fondue ($7.50), truffled grilled cheese ($9), beef stroganoff ($17), and (gross) tuna salad with cottage cheese which brings me back to my childhood a little too clearly. While waiting for our entrees, we received a basket of Parker House rolls. These are the nice squishy white bread treats that, if you can manage not to eat them all, make wonderful toys. You can mold them into sculptures, or shape them into little round beebees to shoot through your straw. My meatloaf sandwich ($11.25) was served on a thick piece of grilled white bread topped first with melty cheese, then the meatloaf, then the gravy. There was a mound of lumpless mashed potatoes alongside. They were so smooth Ken wondered if they were made from instant, but they tasted much too good for that. The portion was huge, I took half home (of course I knew I was going to have dessert). Ken had sauteed liver, beautifully prepared, atop a mound of kale that had been cooked with high quality bacon, sauced with a Madera reduction. He loved it. I surprised him by ordering a lemon meringue tart ($6) for us to share. There were several chocolate desserts that sounded good, but I had a vision of the mile high meringue toppings of my childhood. The tart had only modest swirls of meringue, but it had been made in such a way that it was creamy, as opposed to foamy, and it was really good.The lemon custard was the star. I remembered a gelatinous filling, but this was smooth and velvety, with just the right tart/sweet balance. The pastry was a cross between cookie and pie crust, and stood up well to the filling. This was not an inexpensive meal, but the portions are large and quality is excellent. Plus we had joined an organization called The Lunch Club, which every weekday, emails it's members a discount coupon for a restaurant in their specified zip code. So one of our entrees was free! (The discount coupons differ, some are 20% off the bill, others merely are for a free drink). But, to pay Cafe ZuZu the ultimate compliment - I'd come here and pay full price.~~#~1
Love the carne asada.~~#~1
St. Francis gives the impression you could be dining in one of the finest cities in the world, instead of the 5th largest cities in the USA.Start with their cucumber gin drink, and then order another.  Goat cheese on crostini follows.  Insist on extremely memorable whipped potatoes--a side order-- to accompany your salmon on red quinoa.  Dessert MUST be the chocolate cake with peanut butter gelato accompanied by carmel sauce trailings and carmel corn garnishes.Try dining at the bar for an uncluttered view out the picture window opening, minus the glass.Loved it!  Will happily return.They split our entree for us AND were gracious about the extra trouble we caused--not a wimper.  Truly superior service !~~#~1
"No."  If you ask me about eating at Papaya Thai, that is what I will say. 0 stars for the single kinda scattered and scruffy staffperson.  0 stars for the cook who cannot prepare an offering from the menu as the menu describes it.In this case, I was down to two remaining untried Thai restaurants within quick reach of the Valley Metro Limo, and both in Tempe.  The other half was in Tampa, and since he does not care much for Thai, I get the chance to try one.  The limo arrived at Southern and Mill at 5:17 PM, and connected me with another limo at Broadway. With traffic, getting to McClintock took nearly 15 minutes.  On exiting the limo, 5:50 PM, I walked back about half a block to the restaurant.On entering the restaurant, I picked up a menu and rang the bell and a somewhat harried staff person came to greet me.  He asked me where I wanted to sit, at a table with 1 bench looking directly into the side of a huge fish tank...or the next table, which would leave no buffer between myself and the only other table seated in the restaurant.  There are at least 120 seats in this restaurant.  Why so fiercely contain people in the first three tables close to the door?  You must get your business in fits and hurries and keeping only the 3 tables active is working for you?  Then again, your telling me you are the only staffperson does not surprise me.  The Help Wanted sign on the door was more than an indication that Help is NEEDED!When I was seated, staffperson offered to bring water.  The phone rang and he was off, as he offered another version of "I am the only staffperson here..."  I looked at the menu and made my decision. In the menu, there is a $2 charge listed for sharing.  This goes against everything Thai I have ever known.  The traditional Thai meal has everyone enjoying some of each dish served.  Because of my proximity to the fish tank, I was quite up close and personal with the fish. The water probably isn't filthy, but the plexiglass tank is not helping the perception. 6 PM, as the cellphone chime reminds me of the passing of an hour.  I am waiting for water and a staffperson who can take my order. 6:01, the staffperson comes, bearing a pitcher of water and a (My eyes are rolling in opposite directions because I am either overworked or stoned) smile.  He filled up my glass and asked if I was ready to order.  I replied that I was and ordered Som Tom, the Thai name for the green papaya salad. Staffperson replied that he did not know the Thai names for the menu items.  The phone rang again.Staffperson's attention was no longer on me.  The phone, his Pavlovian stimuli, had taken him away.  I asked if he had heard me.  He replied that he needed to go answer the phone.  He asked if I minded waiting, as he was the only staffperson.  I said I would wait.  Off he went, in pursuit of electronic interaction.  6:10 PM, staffperson returns, apologizing for the telephone delay and asking about my order.  I ordered the papaya salad without the green beans and steamed rice on the side.  Staffperson took the order and went to the kitchen.  The phone rang as he left the table,  his pace quickening as he approached the phone.  6:18 PM, the door opens and 2 potential patrons enter.  The bell rings and staffperson rushes to the waitstand to greet 2 new patrons.  6:20 PM, staffperson returns. He brings the salad and a bowl of rice.  The salad that appears has some of the traditional salad ingredients along with ingredients that have no business being in the salad.  Som Tom does not have cucumber, shredded lettuce or cilantro.  On sending back the initial preparation, staffperson returned with the original preparation, advising the chef stated "This is a traditional Thai presentation of the dish".  I sent the order back, citing the inconsistencies and asking for a new presentation.6:25 pm.  As I empty my water glass, the salad I received previously is returned, minus the cucumber.  In asking staffperson if this is a new presentation or if it is an attempt to correct the original, he replied that he did not know.  I stood and left.  While the advertisement on the window of the establishment says they have "The Best Curry in the Valley",   they will get no second chance to prove it to me.  For all the phone activity, there was no one who came to pick up a carry-out order.  Between this and the somewhat glazed staffperson, I have to wonder if this place is not a front for a drug business.~~#~0
My wife called to have our vent cleaned since our dryer was taking over an hour to dry an average load. Our appointment was scheduled for 8 a.m. not for 8-12 as most places. He showed up at 8 and had the vent clean and working well. Excellent customer service and very friendly.Thanks again,Gary~~#~1
WOW! I had read and heard alot of good things about Smeeks and I thought, "It must be too good to be true," and while out shopping for a few items today, I was proven wrong. I walked in and I instantly felt like a kid in a candy store. They had candy, fun novelties, and I swear everything I looked at it made me think of a friend who would love to find it in their stocking on Christmas day. The store was packed (it is 3 days before Christmas), but the staff was friendly, helpful and went around to make sure everyone found what they needed or if they needed a basket. Guys, I'll be back here throughout the year, and you should check it out. If it doesn't make you smile or make you want to sift through all the goodies, you probably kick kittens for fun (and that's not cool!).~~#~1
My husband & I are addicted to Cherryblossom's ramen. Mr. T is Japanese & I lived in Japan for @4 years, so take my word it's authentic.The mix of foods is not so strange if you're familiar with restaurants in Japan. The ramen is Hakata style, made with a pork broth & may be heavy/oily for some people, so why not please everybody? Be sure to ask for "Cha Shu Ramen" to get a few more pieces of pork. (extra $)The salads are also fantastic; warm lightly fried (10?)Shrimp on a fresh spring mix base with mango dressing,  Shanghai Duck salad, and the Chicken Caesar was perfect, not heavily dressed like some "roadhouses." Mr. T & our daughter loved the Eggplant in Miso Sauce, & even the California Roll was good.It's said Japan took the best of each country's cuisine. So there are French pastries, German beer, Italian pasta, and Indian curries. Save the banana bread for dessert if you can, or get one of their pastries. I've never have enough room.If you like good WHITE bread, buy one of the Pullman loaves on the table by the front door. My first extra 20 pounds in Japan came from the good bread! (No whole grain breads were available 30 years ago!)I think it's too small for groups over six.Maybe we'll see you there.Added 11/18/07I think that their menus are not all alike, so if  ramen isn't on the menu you receive, you can still order it. (It's posted in Japanese on the wall.) For the basic, ask for "Hakata Ramen." For extra pork, ask for "Cha-shu-men" or "Cha-shu-ramen."Either way, there's really not much pork in it. That's why you need a delicious shrimp or duck salad.~~#~1
Went here for lunch after riding dirt bikes in the desert. We have had Mellow Mushroom in Georgia and Florida, but this one was top notch.  Very clean, staff very friendly , and food OMG to die for. The garlic cheese bread is fantastic, and the calzones are my favorite.~~#~1
Once you buy a steak from von hansons, you will never buy steak anywhere else again.  This is the best butcher shop I have ever seen.  Also great sausages, chicken, cuts of lamb. I also get my thanksgiving turkey here.~~#~1
ok, let me be straight with you. i hate paying full price for anything. yes, i'm one of those people. i love a coupon. i love a discount. and i absolutely love a bargain! but i don't like to feel dirty when i leave a store. i felt really, really dirty when i left this store. ewwwwww. this is a yucky ross. dirty, dirty, dirty! the floors and clothing racks were filthy. i couldn't have bought something even if i wanted to because the store was so gross - i got black "stuff" on my hand after touching a clothing rack. the floor was so discolored i'm not sure what the original color was. parts of the store's floor were sticky. many of the clothes had indistinguishable marks on them, presumably from the dirty hangars and racks they are stored on. selection was meager, there wasn't a single shoe, bag, wallet, sock or home decor item that caught my eye. the trip was a waste of an hour that i'll never get back. never, ever again.~~#~0
Please know that this place is WORTH the long wait.  I come to Phoenix once a month for work and I make sure I have dinner here.  There is NOT one thing I can complain about.  Remember, good things come to those who wait.  I HIGHLY recommend waiting in the house next door and having some wine.  The bartenders are very friendly.  The main restaurant will call the house when your table/bar seat is ready.  The pizza is baked in a stone brick oven.  Real firewood is used, not like California Pizza Kitchen's gas oven.  The owner himself makes the pizza.  Every employee is genuinely nice.  With each bite, you have a subtle taste of smoke (not overwhelming).  The crust is thin and crispy...AND MOST IMPORTANTLY...you can fold the slice - for all you NJ/NY natives!  My stomach is churning and mouth salivating as I write more.  I am going to Phoenix this Thursday...guess where I'll be?  PS-Guys, phenomenal eye candy.~~#~1
You know, for a goodwill this one really isn't bad!  They have a ton of clothes that are actually displayed to make them look orderly and clean instead of the usual crammed heaps and stacks you see.  I love the books - a great selection of books you have always meant to read (and I don't mean the old classics, though they have those too) like James Patterson, Anne Rice, and all those gooey Twilight books.  Looks like they moved out most of the furniture recently, but perhaps they will be getting a new shipment soon.  Lots of knick-knacks and vases, and about 25 printers to choose from!  Check here first if you are looking for one of the above stated items - they is a good chance you will find it!~~#~1
I'm not sure what all of the buzz is about because this place wasn't that great! I had the grilled cheese and it was hard and dry!  There was this nasty drunk guy who sat across from our table and it was quite sickening! I will not be going back!~~#~0
As far as sports bars go, this one can't be beat. You won't find one in the East Valley with better food, beer selection, happy hour, or a friendlier staff. This is hands-down one of my favorite places in all of Ahwatukee and the surrounding areas.I've been here bunches of times, and the only one bad experience I had (overcooked burger) they took care of the situation above and beyond.I can't say it enough: go, eat, drink, see for yourself: Public House is the best around.~~#~1
This place is the white-trash Chipotle. The food is mediocre at best. I mean seriously, how can you just up and steal Chipotle's idea! There's no creativity there. The Habenaro Salsa is flavorless and not hot at all. Seriously? I asked for HOT, not some yellowish tomato concoction for the people who can't handle real salsa!  At least Chipotle has hot salsa (not too hot either but much better) for a fast Americanized mexican food. Of course I much rather have the real deal but I do like Chiptole for what it is. Not this crap that Qdoba tries to serve up. The chicken is over seasoned and highly spiced/herbed you can barely taste the chicken. The Fajita veggie were the same. The product looked of very low quality. Oxidizing Guacamole and Lettuce. The meat looked unappetizing as well. Just not at the level of Chipotle. Although I have been here twice, this is the last time for me. I have been to one in Denver and for some reason thought it was better. So maybe it's management but I can say the food is less than good. I much rather go to Chiptole than this wannabe! Employees were dumber than a bag of Frijoles!This place has the worst "Mexican" Food I have ever had next to a pre made burrito from 7-11 or a burrito from Taco Bell. Just disgusting food.~~#~0
I see Jenny Strebe who cuts and Veronica Peebles who colors. They are AMAZING! I am so glad they opened Salon Stylush, it is the perfect size (not too huge and crazy) and it is so modern & cute! Jenny is an amazing hair stylist with the accolades to prove it (she styles hair for fashion shows, magazines, television, etc). Jenny has been cutting my hair for years and she is super sweet and super talented. I trust her with my hair, no question, and recommend her highly. Also, she has a talent for men's hair as well. She cuts my husband's hair and that is one of his best qualities (I'd say!). There are so many men out there with bad hair - Jenny knows how to make it work for men!Veronica has colored my hair for years - and she is hands down one of the best in the industry. I never loved my color until I found Veronica. Now, I trust her completely and know she'll make my hair look great, and natural, which is important to me. She's also super sweet! I highly recommend Veronica as a stylist and colorist.~~#~1
Love this place! Wish we had one here in CA. Great vibe once you walk through that door. Fantastic drinks and goodies!!~~#~1
Price reflects quality and service.  5/2010 purchased wedding gown, brides maids and mothers (bride and groom mothers and grandmothers) dresses.  Girls were rude and our brides maids dresses seems and straps fell apart just before the wedding.~~#~0
The folks here are the best!~~#~1
After unsuccessfully attempting a walk in gel at the posh looking "Sundrops" nail salon with my two year old in tow, I was drawn to a half deserted strip mall just down the street and a small space in the center labeled Andy's Nails. I Yelped the place and saw the decent reviews so I walked in and was immediately attended to by the friendliest faces I've seen in a while. Despite the fact that I was short one babysitter, they began work on my nails right away and when my toddler got restless, one of the very nice owners picked her up and carried her around for 20 minutes!  Not only do they now offer Gelish gel manicures but they offer more colors than many other Arcadia/Biltmore/Camelback Corridor nail salons AND they're cheaper by anywhere from $5-$20! I'm definitely going back and going back soon! My toes are lonely...~~#~1
Ever eat at a Steak 'n Shake?  That's what Freddy's is: a Steak 'N Shake kind of burger and it's delicious! I liked the fries too: very thin, perfectly hot, not too much salt.Nice people, the manager made it a point to get me my meal hot-off-the-grill, even though I came ahead of the "call" and again he met me while he was cleaning tables.  {See my review of "The Habit": their manager never greets customers, can't solve problems from behind a door, always hiding in his office.}  Freddy's Manager was OUTFRONT, ALL THE TIME, WORKING HARD!  Great burger.  Next time I'll get the frozen custard.  I was too full from my triple cheese, CALIFORNIA STYLE-BABY!~~#~1
Romantic, quaint, amazing! We were referred here by a couple of long time Phoenix locals, and we were so happy we took their advice. We ordered a white pizza, a anti-pasta appetizer, and bottle of Chianti. We were able to get a table outside and loved the atmosphere! Perfect date spot...~~#~1
Another vacation that started and ended with US Airways. We arrived/departed on time both ways. My normal sized butt still fits in seats so no issue there. I enjoyed my free drink and chitchat with the flight attendants. Brought my own snacks and read a book. All in all a good beginning/end to a relaxing vacay with the man friend.~~#~1
First off I would like to punch the dip Shit on the food network who said this was the best chicken he ever ate. Yeah the place is filthy, but how they operate their business is redicolus. Service sucks, 49 minute wait for the food sucks, waiting 20 minutes from the first  entree being dropped off until the last person luckily receives their food sucks, being told on the 59th minute of a hour wait for your food, that they are out of your side dishes, sucks, spending my hard earned money at a place that is Ass backwards in any kind of business sense, sucks. At first our group thought it was a joke, then the reverse racism theory was brought up, then we noticed that every table was experiencing the same lack of service. Black, white, purple,orange. They just sucked.~~#~0
I love this place! People are very friendly and very clean restaurant. I come here with co workers for lunch on a weekly basis. I order a gyro pita and side of Greek fries, so delicious! The salads are huge and tasty as well. The Greek fries are amazing with feta cheese and a lemon butter sauce they put over the fries. I can eat here everyday!~~#~1
Awesome.So much better than parking on site.Safe and good prices keep me coming back.Flying during a busy time, go to their website to make a reservation...that's right a reservation! Also print out a coupon for a couple bux off per day.~~#~1
My family and I ate here Saturday night.....based on the reviews of Yelp.We were not disappointed, as a matter of fact, we were pleasantly surprised with every aspect of our evening.  When you arrive at Bobby Q's, the outside makes it feel as if you are about to walk into a dive.  However when you turn the corner and walk in the door, that is not the case.  Very nice ambiance throughout the entire restaurant. They had wonderful mood lighting! I love low mood lighting!  Our server was very friendly and helpful.  Our meals were excellent.  My husband got the Chicken Fried Chicken and I got the Top Sirloin.  We started with the corn bread, which was delicious!  I don't care if it feel apart at least it wasn't dry!  My top sirloin was cooked a perfect Medium and seasoned exceptionally well.  I really loved it and I love steak.  Surprisingly the roasted corn was one of my favorites of the night, I don't usually gobble up corn when I get it with dinner, but man, this was some heavenly corn!  My husbands chicken fried chicken was perfect.  Pounded thin, with a light crispy batter, I hate to say it, but it might have been better than Texaz Grill's chicken!  It was tasty.  My son got the oven cooked pepperoni pizza and it was a large portion for the $4.00 price tag, he even took some home.  Our food was excellent, there wasn't one thing we didn't like, the food was hot, the service was great, the atmosphere was great, we will return!~~#~1
The staff at this location was rude and unfriendly!! Also the store itself was not the cleanest I have seen!~~#~0
Stephen G. hit the nail on the head - "You buy a peaceful experience". I was looking for a resort/spa but also wanted to take advantage of horseback riding as much as I could. This resort definitely exceeded my expectations - the staff is AMAZING (friendly, accommodating, etc), the food was delicious, the resort is beautiful and the rooms were also clean and well-maintained. Everyone I encountered went the extra mile with regard to service. I came back to NYC completely rejuvenated.~~#~1
This place is great! A coworker and I stopped in for lunch this afternoon and was blown away by both the food and staff.You get a large bowl from the cashier and can personally stuff whatever meat, veggies and garnish you want. Then, mix a neat selection of sauces. Finally, watch the entertaining chefs cook your meal on a large heated stone.Everything comes out fresh, hot and delicious! Want a tip? Use the wax paper next to the chicken to "stuff" your bowl. Everything will shrink when cooked and this will allow you to have a bigger meal for the same price.~~#~1
Great food and drink. The traditional margaritas are the best. Sara was our server and she was very knowledgable about the menu and was quite entertaining. The cheese enchilada that I had was one of the best ever.~~#~1
I love this location, and I love this product.  I think the prices are reasonable considering the quality of product you are getting.  If you've only been to the Scottsdale Fashion Square location and hate it, give this one a try.  It's got a much better vibe and is a lot less packed.  Walked right in was helped, she grabbed what I needed and I was off.  It took all of 15 minutes even with picking out a totally new foundation then I used before.~~#~1
This place is as good as I'd heard.  We came here for a day-late birthday dinner for my middle daughter/Father's Day dinner for her husband.  She and his six-year old daughter ordered a Hawaiian style with pineapple and ham, he and I  got the Margherita Pizza with garlic, tomatoes, olive oil, fresh basil, mozzarella, and romano cheese.  Both were so delicious!  He also got some chicken wings which were tender and juicy and not spicy at all, dipped in either of two great sauces, ranch or marinara.  The pizza's were about $13 each for the larges.  I usually have no problem quitting after two slices but the  flavor squishing around in my mouth was so good I couldn't resist taking a third piece at this place. The decor was pretty and the service was great--the server checked back several times to see if we were doing okay or needed anything. I would definitely be a regular if I lived near here.  On a side note, next door is the Aloha Kitchen which we had eaten at about a week ago and was also very good!62010~~#~1
Let me begin by telling you about my horribly debilitating fear of going to the dentist.  It's epic.  Weeks before an appointment I start having nightmares.  Thinking about sitting in the dental chair makes me break out in a cold sweat.  I require nitris oxide for a simple cleaning. The sound of the drill is enough to make me want to claw my face off.  Basically, every visit has been the worst experience ever for the past 30 years....Enter Dr. Marcia Blazer.  I read about her online when searching for a local dentist here in Scottsdale.  I literally googled "dentists for anxious patients", and her name popped up.  Her website appeared too good to be true.  They offered nitris (plus), offered non invasive options for dental procedures (double plus), and offered a staff used to accomodating those with a healthy dose of dental fear.I went in for my first visit (a cleaning and exam), and I was amazed at how comfortable they made me feel.  They were warm and friendly, and put me at ease immediately.  During the cleaning, my least favorite part is always when they use the scrapy,pointy torture device to stab off all the plaque at the gumline.  How happy was I when they used an air abrasion tool instead...felt like a cool stream of water on your teeth, and BAM, they're clean!  They were so calming, that when I was informed that I had 2 cavities, I didn't even have a panic attack at the thought of coming in.Fast forward two weeks to my filling appointment.  I had requested nitris (hey, I was feeling better but still SUPER anxious), which they had all set up in the room for me when I walked in.  Now here's my favorite part.  As I sat in the chair, the assistant brought over two big boxes full of dvd's and asked me what movie I would like to watch during the procedure...What?? So I picked a lighthearted comedy (50 First Dates).  I was then given noise eliminating headphones to use (goodbye horrible drilling sound), nitris (hello happy gas), and a few hand signals to recognize if I was supposed to open or close my mouth.  And we were off!  She didn't try to maintain conversation (soooo annoying when dentists do that), and before I knew it she was done and I was disappointed because my movie wasn't quite over!  I was even told that had my dentist not needed the room I was in for another patient, that I would have been welcome to stay and just finish the movie!I have had several interactions with this office since then (regarding billing and follow up), and every time it is a pleasure to deal with them.  I highly recommend this office to anyone!~~#~1
Stinkweeds shaped my formative years.  Really.I started shopping at the (now gone) Tempe location when I was 15.  I had a few older friends into independent music who introduced me to this record store.  I begged my parents for rides and, when that wasn't happening, hopped on the bus for the hour-long trek.  Totally worth it.  100%.  I can't tell you how many awesome bands I began listening to just because I would browse the selection endlessly for something that looked interesting.  If I needed something specifically, Stinkweeds would order it for me if they didn't already have it in stock.  The staff was always welcoming and helpful, sometimes offering their own suggestions.But it's just a record store, right?  Wrong.  Stinkweeds is the jewel of Phoenix, as far as I am concerned.  Now that it's out in central Phoenix, I make it in far less.  Total bummer!~~#~1
Three cheers to Yelp for helping me find where in the Valley to go for real beef jerky!  The fresh stuff which has more beef than chemicals.  (The convenience store packages just were not doing it for me!) After checking out the website, I emailed good friends in Las Vegas (who used to live in Minnesota), asking if they were familiar with Von Hanson's.  (They have 21 locations in Minnesota - and ONE in Chandler.)My roommate and I went on July 2. They were running a special for NY strips - buy one, get one free - so that was added to the plan in addition to the jerky.SCORE!  We picked up a half pound each of the peppered jerky and the cajun spicy.  $18/lb.  The NY strips were (if memory serves...) $14.99/lb, and the steaks were averaging a little over 3/4 lb - so super yay for the BOGO sale - it brought the meat down to regular grocery prices. I have to say - the quality of the meat is amazing!  Just looking at the cuts in the display case, I can declare Von Hanson's makes AJ's look like Fry's!  These were GORGEOUS!  Quite possibly the prettiest steaks I've ever seen!I also grabbed a couple pigs ears for my dog, and the roommate picked up a package of her favorite kind of sausage (linguisa).Admittedly, I am not a sausage expert.  Plus, I live very close to Schreiner's - so while I would have no problem buying sausage from Von Hanson's, I wouldn't make the hike to Chandler just for those.  The selection was quite impressive, though!Overall - this place has everything for carnivorial happiness!  (Hey - if you understood the context, it's a word, right?)  Great selection of beef, chicken and pork products.  Tons of spices, sauces, rubs and marinades.  Nice selection of unique beer and wines.  Fridge and freezer cases with more meats, sides, and desserts! Yes, it's pricey - but the quality is certainly there to justify it.Once home, we grilled up the steaks using our favorite rub.  OMG amazing meat!  Probably the best steak I've had in YEARS - and NY strip isn't even my cut of choice!The peppered beef jerky is full of YUM - and this is so strange to write - but the Cajun is a bit spicy for my taste.  (And I adore spicy!)  It's amazingly good, and addictive - but almost requires a cold beer to go along with it to help cut the heat.The Vegas via Minnesota friends emailed back Monday - they know Von Hanson's quite well - and are grateful there isn't one in Vegas - it would KILL the weekly grocery budget with how often they'd be in!  They love, love, LOVE the place - and I am now under strict orders to bring them care packages from here whenever I come up to visit!Oh - and Layla (my pooch) was pretty stoked about the pig ears - so in addition to my five stars, please add two paws up!  (I didn't tell her they have a whole dog food and treat section - I am on a budget, after all!)~~#~1
How could you write a bad review about a mountain?  Great sight to see.~~#~1
Business takes me out to Mesa yesterday.  After chatting with a friend about possible lunch locations, he tells me about Georges Gyros, near University and Country Club.  I decide to give it a try, as it isn't too far from my destination.  Situated right next door to Sun Devil Liquors, I'm surprised I hadn't been there before, or, for that matter, even noticed it.  I guess when I hit SDL, I've got tunnel vision.  First thing I notice is there appears to be plenty of parking, even at 12:30, for lunch.  Outer patio, stuck out into the parking lot, not overly appealing, might be nicer in the evening, I guess?  The interior is clean, plenty of seating, a small bar at one end, and a counter from which you place your order.  Never having been before, I ask the counter-person for a recommendation.  "What's good?"  He suggests the Original Gyro, served with fries or a greek salad.  Sounds good, I'll take it with fries.  With drink, under $9.  A few moments later (actually, I saw three other tables get served, so it seemed like a longish wait), a ginormous gyro arrives, with a huge helping of fries.  The gyro was huge, overflowing with, umm, meat, gyro meat, I guess, white onions, diced tomatoes and cucumber sauce (Tzatziki, I think).  The meat was well cooked, artfully shaved, and tender.  The sauce was also very good.  The pita?  Warm, soft and tasty.  The fries? Crisp and golden brown, and piping hot, about 3-4 times the size of Mickie D's or about 1/2 a 'steak fry'.  I was very impressed with the quality of the food, the cleanliness of the dining area, and the presence of a bar.  Most folks were eating gyros, or good sized greek salads.  Other items on the menu include several different gyros, burgers, sandwiches, a decent selection of pasta dishes and all kinds of Greek and non-Greek appetizers.  I plan on coming back, perhaps before a foray into Sun Devil Liquors...~~#~1
YOWZA! I love this place. I had heard great things about this place before and actually received some of the olives and olive oil as a gift last year. I decided to take my mom and try it out for lunch. The food was pretty good, but the best thing for me is that they have Cerignola olives! This was music to my ears when they told me they had them. I have been looking everywhere, checking every grocery store, gourmet shop in Chandler and Tucson and nobody has them. I can't wait to go back and try the rest of their menu! Oh and expect a little off roading, the parking lot is loose gravel :)~~#~1
Let me preface this story with the fact that it was not my little guy who I had to take in. I am dog sitting my friend's dog. They are on vacation. Dr. Alber and his amazing staff were unbelievable. I called at 5:15. They got me in at 5:30. Dr. Alber spent 40 minutes with me. Explained everything to me thoroughly. Little Rusty just has allergies and an eye infection but it was making him miserable. Dr. Alber gave me a plan of attack to care for it. EXTREMELY COST EFFECTIVE. $70 out the door, RX in hand and a tube of eye drops. I am in awe. I will recommend this clinic to everyone I know. I just cannot say enough good things about these lovely people. THANK YOU PRESTIGE ANIMAL CLINIC. YOU ROCK!!!!!!! I will now be taking my own little guy there. You guys are now the only vet I will ever use.~~#~1
Where I had the most delicious thing I ever put in my mouth.This is a favorite of me and my friends, especially for sunday morning brunch. I would say we go at least one time a week. Their Quiche (especially the Goat cheese, caramelized onions, and wallnuts) is the best you will ever have and their salad dressing (which is made in house) is equally delicious. The most delicious thing I have ever eaten in my whole life was actually a rose macaroon. I have never had an emotional reaction to a food item before but I swear I almost cried and had flashbacks of my childhood being at the botanical gardens. Any way, if you haven't been here you HAVE to go. Its one of Arizona's few authentic cultural treasures.~~#~1
Gosh Darn It! They had to be good. I was hoping, since they are so close to my home  and right next to where I shop for groceries most often (Fresh & Easy), that they'd be horrible. Then I'd never have to go again... But, alas...too good to not go back, that's for sure!I've said it before, I'll say it again: if you don't like a lot of frosting, just wipe off the portion you don't want. Heck, if you're sitting next to me and my kids, they'll eat it for you!!I didn't think I was much of an frosting fan either so I wiped off most from the Chocolate Chip Caramel, only to find that the milk chocolate frosting covered with a caramel drizzle was UH-MAZING! Scraped that heap right back in my mouth where it belongs! Yum. Equally impressive it the dense, moist cake (as opposed to light and fluffy texture; these puppies are HEAVY). The White Chocolate Raspberry was chock-full of white chocolate chips and the frosting was not too sweet. It was the prettiest one as well, with white sprinkles and raspberry sauce drizzle. Thoroughly enjoyed the two other chocolate selections (Texas Milk Chocolate & Midnight Magic) as well--Yes! I had four, but only cut them in half so I could save the rest for (my husband) later.Bonus points for presentation (the box is adorable) and variety.~~#~1
This place is an experience.  I can't stop thinking about it!!!  I love the weird odd flavors (Basil Lime?)  and everything tastes so fresh and organic.  It's nice to have something like this close by our house!  A true guilty pleasure.~~#~1
Being from Sweden you just like salmon and at Le Chalet you can get a delicous Nordique Crepe with salmon! Never had anything like that in Sweden! Besides the great crepe and friendly service from the owner Alain Keller I was also treated to a laughing experience. They have a comedy show twice a month. Great place to eat and have a nice relaxed evening!~~#~1
Very nice location but food was awful.  Had a chicken salad yuck.  Service stunk big time!~~#~0
This is a quaint little airport which is very convenient if you are travelling to the Tempe/Mesa area, or already know people who live there.  I say it's convenient-- if you are flying in from Grand Island or Grand Forks or Rapid City or East Bugtussel, since the only commercial tenant at this decomissioned air force base is Allegiant Airlines, which specializes in flying you from nowhere to somewhere (Phoenix, Las Vegas, Orlando that sort of thing).  But from landing to sitting in my rental car it was maybe 20 minutes tops and I was heading out to lunch in the Phoenix area (don't bother with purchasing the "snacks" on the flight, just make sure you are prepared beforehand).~~#~1
I just have to tell you that this place is amazing. Not only is the food top notch so is the service. It is a rare find to get awesome food, a comfortable environment and excellent service at a reasonable price all rolled into one. The homemade sausage is excellent, the pizza is perfect, the choice of deli meats is extensive and homemade side salads (red potato dill is my favorite) and everything on the menu is fantastic. I have read that people say the wait is long, (which I find unfounded) but when you are considering what you are getting, the wait means nothing. I have waited longer for Sysco reheated food in a restaraunt (bleh) and had worse service. I would take a 10 min longer wait for really good, fresh food any day. If you can't appreciate that then maybe chain restaurants is where you should stay. We really do our best to stay away from those and finding places like Defalco's is really tough. We will continue to be loyal customers and spread the word of one our favorite places to eat. Don't pass the opportunity to try this place!!~~#~1
I don't expect much when grabbing lunch at a mall, but I expect better than this.  The seaweed salad was a generic overly soy tasting disappointment, the rainbow roll was barely worth eating - the shrimp on the roll tasted fishy, the fish was mealy-textured, and the rich was soft and too sticky.  The yellow tail roll suffered from the same, and we luckily were cautious enough not to try sashimi.  The miso soup was served barely like warm.  The tea was served barely luke warm. That was when we finally got service, which took a veritable eternity.  Tea refills?  Good luck on getting someone's attention for that.The inside is a dismal, cavernous sport-bar/pool hall sort of feel.  Basically no redeeming features here.~~#~0
I went here for my birthday this year. The best part was my friends picked up the tab:) The food was fantastic. When I found out from a friend who works here that the same chef who created the city hall menu is the executive chef at ocean club I knew getting a steak to compliment my fish was the right choice. The only down side was that everyone who went out that night were so full that we decided that it was a better idea to go home ad sleep than hit the clubs.....well maybe that wasn't a bad thing after all.~~#~1
Wonderful place to hangout with friends ...small and cozy. Hoegaarden white ale with chicken tikka masala pasty is my usual.~~#~1
I dropped off a ton of things here when I was liquidating my life in this town and it was a terrific experience.Their donation program is quick and easy (just drive around to the back of the store and put it in a bin) and really helps out people by selling things at affordable prices and the profits go to provide assistance to the community.Such great people at this location especially.~~#~1
I Love Lolo's Chicken and Waffles and you will too! Recently my fiancé and I went to Lolo's. I had heard about Lolo's and Mrs. White's for years, but never took the time to go to the Phoenix locations. When this south Scottsdale location opened, I made it a point to go and try the food. The food is excellent or in my best Brooklyn accent "Forget about it". But don't forget about it, the MAC-N-CHEESE is a most try. The chicken is FANTABULOUS, the COLLARD GREENS are on point and they serve Kool Aid. Yes I said Kool Aid. I must have had a gallon of GRAPE KOOL AID. Before this, the last time I had Kool Aid was 1968. This place is very popular, so you may have to wait for a table, but it is well worth it. This place is so popular that Sports, Music, Acting and Reality celebrities can be seen here regularly. When we were there we saw the rapper Biz Markie. He did the song "Just a Friend" back in 1990.  The only down side - although the service was generally good, it gets so busy that at times the server may get distracted and may not come back to you as timely or often as you may like. BOTTOM LINE, I LEFT FULL, HAPPY AND WITH A KOOL AID SMILE. TRY IT YOU WILL LIKE IT~~#~1
Love Belly Rubz!! At first little Oscar was timid about me dropping him off but when I came to pick him up he didn't want to quit playing! He has really bad separation anxiety and hates kennels, so it is always worrisome when we try a new groomer. He loved playing and came out looking so handsome! We will be returning to Belly Rubz this week for some more play time and grooming!~~#~1
Wish I could rate negative stars.... With so many bar choices this place is by far the worst.Last Saturday a group of friends went out for a friend's birthday celebration in Scottsdale and decided if we split up that we would meet at the end of the night at Loco Patron. It was increasingly obvious that the staff was hostile and irritated that they could not close up early. We finished our last call drinks and started to head out. The friend who was celebrating his birthday waited behind at the bar until his friends left the bathroom. At this point two bouncers became extremely agitated at our friend and demanded that he put down his drink and leave. My friend started to explain his reason for not leaving (friends still in bathroom) but was quickly cut off. I watched from the patio as the two bouncers (both obviously larger in height and weight then my friend) quickly escalate from talking to both grabbing my friend under the arms and start to carry him out. As he was carried backwards he lost his balance and tumbled back with both bouncers on top of him. The bouncers slammed him down headfirst on the cement outside of the establishment, pinned him down with their elbows and hit him. At this point I had run behind the bouncers and was yelling at them to get off of him. I had already taken out my phone to call 911 and I quickly tried to take a picture to show that they were using excessive force. We demanded to see the manager at which point the bouncer said he was the manager and refused our request. He swiped my friend's phone down out of his hand and broke it on the ground. Several people had called 911 at this point and we waited outside for the police to arrive. The police arrived and took down the bouncers' information and stated that they would be recording this incident. I am absolutely adamant in saying that neither I nor my friends will ever frequent Loco Patron again. We were treated disrespectfully by untrained staff who were either too eager to close up to get home or get a power high by manhandling non threatening, non physical patrons of their establishment. Based on the behavior of the two bouncers I assume that this bar operates without any written guidelines on how bouncers should conduct themselves. What I witnessed was full on assault and an infringement on human rights and I plan on writing any regulatory agency I can think of. These people make a bad name for all of the bouncers out there that conduct themselves within the guidelines of the law.~~#~0
Beautiful country setting in Phoenix on an old farm. Watch closely because it is easy to miss as it is actually an old farm near the Legacy Golf resort at South Mountain. Very good home made breakfast with fresh ingredients from the farm. Orange juice was fresh and tasty. Eggs and bacon were very good. Biscuits and gravy were excellent. The setting was the star of this breakfast!I would recommend ! You won't be sorry !~~#~1
We ate here to celebrate our engagement during a weekend getaway to AZ. My fiance had coordinated with the restaurant beforehand to have rose petals and 2 glasses of champagne set for us before we arrived. The rose petals were fresh and a mix of red, yellow, and pink... beautiful colors!I ordered one of their fish dishes that came is a REALLY hot skillet, and I accidently burned my hand on the skillet. We saw one of the employees walking by, so we asked if he had anything for the burn, and he ran off looking for burn spray and bandaids. He was back in no time with everything I needed to treat the burn - amazing service! I THINK his name was Nick, but I can't remember.Good job, T Cooks!~~#~1
i've never had a problem getting assistance here, except when it's busy, usually on a sat/sun. it's not that far from the house, maybe a mile, so i if i'm in a real bind, i come on by here to pick up some stuff. they've offered groupons here and with those, i've bought some power tools and hardware. ace brand is cheaper price but the quality seems to be just as good!~~#~1
This place used to be amazing.  My favorite memories of past years is going to this seafood place with my parents.  It's not the same anymore.We went for my wife's 30th birthday.  My dad decided to join us.  My wife ordered steak and shrimp, my dad ordered steak, I ordered a crab stuffed lobster.  I have had the crab stuffed lobster many times before.  I was craving it.We got our appetizer's.  Dad got snails, wife and I shared steamers.  My dad was happy with the snails.  But then again, how can you go wrong with snails doused in garlic and butter?  The steamers were steamed little neck clams in a garlic broth.  It was not long neck clams like the rest of the world calls steamers.  I wasn't about to argue with the server that these are the wrong clams.The food came and for the first time in my life I was asking the server to take back my meal before I even tried it.  It looked dry and over cooked.  I told the server I've had this dish many times before and this is not the way it's supposed to be.  He told me this is what it's supposed to look like and begged me to try it.  I took one bite and I couldn't even swallow it because it was so dry.  Of course the server was gone by this point and didn't come back for 10 minutes to ask me how it was.While I was waiting for the server to return, I told my family I was just going to get the steak.  They just shook their head and told me not to.  I took one bite of my dad's steak and spat it out.  How do you screw up steak this bad?  It tasted like beef jerky and butter.  My dad and wife would have complained too, but it's my wife's birthday and I am already stealing her thunder.  I swapped my meal out for a steamed lobster.  How do you screw up a steamed 1 1/2 lobster?  Fortunately, that came out fine.So we left hungry and $300 poorer.  I used to not mind paying the money they charged but now, it is not worth it.  I am really hoping people stop coming here so they can just close down.~~#~0
Fantastic meal.     Fantastic experience.     I am a vegetarian.    I cook a lot and am very conscious of food preparation, starting with sourcing.    I don't just patronize Farmers Markets, I patronize CERTAIN Farmers Markets....that sort of thing.    Long story short, if I am going to dine out, I want something very special.  VERY special. Quiessence exceeded my expectations at almost every turn.    I dined there with my son and daughter-in-law...both truly expert cooks...more knowledgeable than I.     All of us were BLOWN AWAY by our meal.    We got the Farmers Feast without the wine pairings so we could choose our own wine.     I got the vegetarian...they got the carnivore (or ominvore or whatever they call it!).     Truthfully, labels are irrelevant.      It's all in the taste...and the tastes are sublime!I was impressed by how much variety was in each plate.      Theirs were similar but each a little different.      More importantly, there was a marvelous progression of very carefully crafted flavors.      The most impressive thing:   The chef clearly wanted to offer his own interpretations .     That he did so while letting the fabulous ingredients speak for themselves is truly remarkable.The setting is beautiful.     The servers are unpretentiously proud of their community and the work they are doing and seemed to enjoy our enjoyment as well.Our only criticism (and it is minor)  is that although the desserts were beautifully crafted, we felt that they did not reflect the intentions of local sustainability.    There is so much wonderful local fruit (used in other courses, I might add!)...perhaps adding some to the desserts would carry out the theme more completely...I'm sure the chefs' creativity can conjure more ideas than I!That said, I will return!    As often as possible!    Quiessence and the Farm at South Mountain are an unparalleled resource for the Phoenix community...easy to get to from any part of the Valley...no excuses, folks!...Go!~~#~1
what can I say - we're CF regulars...just love the place. I guess we are lucky because we have never had to wait more than 15-20 minutes for 3 of us.  We eat here at least twice a month and we always start with the avocado egg rolls - they are to die for and the dipping sauce is yummy!  I usually get a Glam burger - the only time I eat red meat -  and so far have not had one I did not like. I  often take 1/2 home so I can save room for some cheesecake, an absolute must when at CF. We have never had a bad cheesecake and try a different one each time. This is the only hamburger that I have liked the next day - usually hamburger is the one food that is not a good take home food as it just does not taste good as a left over - but I have actually eaten it cold because I took a bite before heating it and just kept going...yes, weird I know.If nothing else, go there for some avocado egg rolls and then treat yourself to a cheesecake....I'm totally addicted! Absolute divine decadence! ;D~~#~1
Had some amazing cuisine at Milagro's. The chef is truly an innovative genius. Our food was so unique and delicious. Plus, the weather was so nice that we sat out on their beautiful patio and watched the sunset on the purple mountains. I highly recommend the PB & J appetizer. It's nothing you have ever had before I can assure you. I would also highly recommend the swordfish dish and tacos.~~#~1
Decided on a whim at the last minute to go here for dinner tonight, I guess that's not the thing to do here.  Worked out perfect though, arrived at just about 4pm to see a hand full of people waiting and the the restaurant didn't open till 5pm.  After a short debate we decided to stay, it helped that there was ample shade.  The wait while hot was not uncomfortable and for the most part, newbies and veterans honored each others arrival order.  40 seats is not much for a place that does this much business and it was surprising to learn that most waiting were from out of town.  I also learned that reservations are accepted on line for parties of 6 to 10 and only 3 reservations per night.  Reservations are usually 1 1/2 to 2 months out.  Luckily for us there was only one reserved table for 10 ahead of everyone.  5 o'clock rolled around and the loading procedure ran smooth as clock work and we had drink and food orders in by quarter after.  Service was excellent and fast with just the right amount of time between salad and main course.  I could not have asked for much more from my food, maybe a bit more basil on my mozzarella and tomato salad, everything was amazing including my Mexican coke.  We ordered 2 pizzas, both wood fire baked to perfection.  I could have eaten a whole loaf of the bread that comes with the salads, or for $2 on its own.  None of our food was greasy or soggy, the olive oil they use is excellent and the fresh mozzarella mouth watering.  I will go back again, planning on getting there an hour before opening.  Although the food is amazing and well worth an hours wait in the Phoenix sun and heat, I would not wait for 4 to 6 hours as some people do.  So for me this was a win and a lucky last minute dinner decision.~~#~1
Great time, great location, ability to park in garage behind it. Beautiful decor, candles, white furnishings, trimmed in wood. Excellent vodka choices that will have you dancing on that raised table all nite which gives you a cool panoramic view of the place. See if you can spot the dj booth! He's cool, friendly door staff. The bartenders kind of ignore you and there's a brunette girl bartender-stay away from her. Downer attitude, and she will charge you for 2 drinks even though they have a 2 for 1 special. But it's a cool club and it's 99% certain you'll have great time.~~#~1
We drove in from LA for spring training.  Had a free evening and the old Pizza Hut remake looked interesting.  To our great surprise, we had one of the best Thai meals in a long time.  Once you get inside, you'll forget this used to be an old Pizza Hut and you'll be transported to a bit of Southeast  Asia.  Good food, good service...and the price is great.  I loved the eggplant with beef and the Pad See Yew (spelled differently).  Was going to go again, but they close on Sundays...boo.  Don't know if it's consistently this good, but for our one night in Phoenix, we were pleasantly surprised.  Definitely worth a try if you're looking for good Thai food.  You don't necessarily have to have a lot of heat in your food because they have plenty of dishes for chili-adverse people like me but it's there for those that need the heat.  The food presentation and description will remind you of Chinese cuisine, but the flavors are unique and delicious...and definitely NOT Chinese.  The Thai fried rice is definitely more than a side dish...it's a meal in itself.  Try this place and you won't be disappointed.~~#~1
Beef gyros are always good here.~~#~1
My daughter and I really enjoy eating here. We tend to order the same thing every time because it's so good. She gets the grilled cheese and tomato soup combo and I get the grilled salmon nicoise salad. They both rock. It's cafeteria style all the way up to the point you pay, then you are served the rest of the way by a waiter who brings you your food and takes care of you. The food is always very fresh and delicious. And by the time we're out of there, it costs no more than eating in the food court but the experience and quality of the food are miles beyond. Highly recommended.~~#~1
Found the Tuck Shop on my Urban Spoon AP and what a grand surprise it ended up being!  In the heart of Coronado this little house has been transformed to a true Phoenix jewel!The food was amazing..we had pork with a pasta and broccoli.  The pork had two amazing sauces that my boyfriend I argued over which was the better.  The pasta was okay a bit of a cumin flavor but great once we mixed it with the pork's sauce.  The broccoli was a great fresh touch.  The manager came over and spent some time talking to us more about the menu and plans to open another place with a different menu soon.  A must try if you are a down town kinda person!  The crowd  was a mix of tshirts casual to formal and the patrons ages ranged just as much.  The menu changes with the season so go check it out!  Only complaint I've heard from people I've recommended was the lack of choice if you are a vegetarian.~~#~1
For a sub shop, great place.Delivery is freaky fast for sure.  I order delivery half the time.Pro's- fast delivery- quick service if ordering onsite- staff friendly- food is goodCon's- No WiFi.  Would like since AT&T service spotty near this building. Good spot.  Glad there is a location here.~~#~1
Maybe I ate at a different restaurant than the other people, or once they got through the "soft opening"  they gave up, because this place was not good.The service was mediocre at best, they seemed scattered and unfocused, took five minutes to get water.  I gave up on ordering anything else after that.The food?  Bland hamburger, that was cooked perfectly in the center.  Too bad that outside of the center inch it was completely overcooked and dry.  Soggy duck fat fried and average sweet potato fritters.  Let's talk about this "coal oven".  While the burgers are cooked in a coal oven, you could tell by the smoke hanging over the restaurant, they are cooked in an iron skillet i.e. pan fried!  The coal adds absolutely zero to the burger.Overall, if I am going to spend $10 on a burger with no sides, it better be perfect, and this wasn't.  I would also hope $5 would get me more than two fritters.~~#~0
Dining at Roaring Fork was enjoyable. The decor is warm and cozy, with an upscale vibe. Our large group was accommodated for on the patio, and since it was happy hour, we were quite a demanding bunch.  The service was a little slow, but all drinks and food came out perfectly. I had trouble deciding what to order because everything looked so good! I split the Big Ass Burger (a huge ground chuck patty with cheddar cheese, peppered bacon, thick-cut tomatoes, pickles, and onions) and a kettle of fries with a couple friends. I also had the mixed greens salad (field greens with candied walnuts and feta, with some sort of vinegarette). The ahi tuna looked really good, as did the fish tacos. I also heard raves about the green pork chili. So many amazing options & a great atmosphere--I'll definitely be back soon!!~~#~1
Amazing food. Great date night place with an impressive wine list.  Definitely come her again and more often.~~#~1
NEW LOCATION FOR 2012: Portland Parkway in Downtown Phoenix, Portland St. & Central Ave, right across from the Roosevelt Light Rail Station! Saturday, November 12, 10am-4pmFind more info here: http://www.localfirstaz.com/fall-festival/Bigger location = more fun!~~#~1
I am a huge fan of this restaurant. I love their locally grown fruits and veggies. I love their healthy options. I had their brown rice with curry sauce, veggies, and organic chicken...it was incredible! Can't wait to travel to Arizona again and return to this wonderful restaurant!PLEASE OPEN ANOTHER LOCATION IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA! It would be a hit!~~#~1
My daughter began taking classes at Encore 6 years ago.  At the time she had a bit of an attitude and didn't do too well with other girls.  She instantly fell in love with Regina and took numerous classes from hip hop (her first choice) to ballet, jazz, and lyrical.  I watched my daughter blossom into an amazing young woman as well as an amazing dancer.  Regina involves the girls and boys in the competition experience so that they have more opportunity to learn confidence and self esteem.  My daughter has had the opportunity to travel to California and Las Vegas with the studio to participate in Nationals and Master Classes.  Encore is not JUST family owned, it is a family environment.  I checked other studios but found a less than friendly welcome to new participants.  I couldn't recommend anything more than Encore and the skills that your child learns.  My daughter now works at the studio as well as dancing and my youngest daughter is taking her first classes now.  I am looking forward to another 6 years or more with the Encore family.~~#~1
Ugh.  My tip-off should have been the Guy Who Saw Me Reading The Menu and came outside to tell me the food was good.  But I was craving Chinese, I work near the COFCO center, and it was threatening to rain.  I scanned the menu, found Kung Pao chicken, and ordered up.  They told me 5 minutes, and they were accurate.  Price was reasonable.  Waiting area was comfortable and well-decorated.  Food was inedible.   I got the lunch special, which include soup, egg roll, entree and fortune cookie.  I couldn't eat any of it.  The soup (hot and sour) was way too sour.  I felt like I would get acid reflux if I ate it.  I couldn't order the fried rice, because it contains peas (I've learned to ask...childhood trauma).  The rice was clotted together and difficult to eat.  The kung pao chicken contained a suspiciously generous amount of meat...so much so that I questioned whether it was actually chicken.  I watch too many movies.  The egg roll was just gross.  It seemed like the wad of mushy veggies was wrapped in biscuit dough before it was deep-fried.  The fortune cookie was stale, and the fortune was even lame.  I would've done better to get soaking wet and hit up Panda Express.~~#~0
Good prices but this please is honestly not worth the hassle. First of all you have to leave your purse at the counter. I am not comfortable doing that anywhere. Who does that? The only place I have ever seen this before was ASU's bookstore. Then you walk in this warehouse that has NO air conditioning!!! I made the mistake of going yesterday in the middle of the day (111 degrees out, yikes!) Then you get inside and you have to carry a catalog to refer to for prices since items are unmarked in large boxes. If they had a/c it would have been worth it to save a few bucks on the toys my dog destroys in minutes but no air conditioning??? IN ARIZONA?? Madness!~~#~0
Here's a thought, don't post on the door to your restaraunt "Up scale Mexican Food" unless you can prove it.  This was not upscale, it was barely pass-able  as decent.  Didn't help that the waitress got both of our orders wrong.  Will not return.~~#~0
Great service, great food, highly recommend.  We had the scollops and they were to die for, the scotch beef and mac and cheese were also amazing.  Will definitely go back and recommend to friends.~~#~1
The Montelucia Resort is home to Crave Cafe, and the fact that I was blown away by how beautiful the resort is has nothing to do with how impressed I was with Crave.What are you craving at the moment?  Perhaps a cup of coffee?  a scoop of gelato?  an empanada? gourmet pastry?  homemade tomato soup?  perhaps a panini sandwich filled with turkey, cheese,  grilled eggplant, and cranberry compote? red wine? magazine? fresh fruit? Diet Coke?Whatever your 'crave-ing' - Crave has it all!In addition to pretty much anything your heart desires, Crave also has an extremely friendly staff and offers limited seating (in and outside) with gorgeous views of Camelback mountain.After a full tour of the resort, we were hungry for lunch and decided to have a quick bite at Crave... We shared a sandwich, slice of quiche, and tomato soup - all of it was delicious!  I am sure I'll be craving a return trip to the Montelucia sometime soon, and when I do, I'm sure I'll pop into Crave for whatever I need at that time.~~#~1
Please excuse this review as I am writing it as I come to from my food coma. We just moved to Phoenix and at the time of dining we were not familiar with the Fox Restaurant Group. We happened upon CD on accident on a Tuesday night. I must say the place was pretty hoppin' for an early week night. We ordered the pretzels with fondue, the fried chicken and the steak. It was so good we didn't even speak to each other through the entire sitting. It was the kind of meal you don't mind having indigestion after because you get the pleasure of re tasting the deliciousness. Gross, I know, but you know what I'm talking about! The server we had was as good as a ghost. We never wanted for anything but he left us alone. I wasn't super crazy about the monkey bread but my honey ate it like we hadn't had a ridiculously large meal 15 minutes before. I'd kinda like to shave off like a 1/4 of a star because the staff was ultra trendy/Indie as were a majority of the patrons. They looked like H&M and Urban Outfitters threw up all over them but if that's the gimmick I'm ok with it since the food was so amazing.~~#~1
The people at this title company are as good as it gets.They are eager to do a really good job for the agents that usethem.  Bill Risser and Paul Guenther are techno pros regardingthe Social Media techniques and readily share their expertiseand time to teach the skills of Twitter, Facebook, Hootsuite, and other aspects of Social Media which agents can utilize to serve their clients in a diligent and efficacious manner.  The buyers and sellers of  property will really gain by using them because their handling of the transaction will be efficiently and quickly finished.~~#~1
prepare to spend a few hours here and really have a romantic experience. the food is divine. the service is laid back (in a good way). the chef runs the whole show and plays all hats. the menu is forever changing and when you make a reservation he will ask you questions so he can tailor your meal and experience to your needs. probably not a good first date place because if the date goes wrong, you will be stuck for a while. perfect spot for an anniversary or something. or even just to have a nice meal with people you know and care about.~~#~1
Hands down, the best pizza in the East Valley!!!! Tastes like I'm back in New York City, that's how good the pizza is! They do all sorts of combinations and toppings. Mmmm mmmm good. The hero sandwiches and wings are good too. Located in a strip mall next to AMC movie theaters, it's a great place to go before or after the movies. And they deliver, too. Much better quality than chain pizzerias.~~#~1
If your day is lacking a good decision, this place will change the course of your life - at least for an hour.I have only ever ordered the Oggie (I'm a one pasty kind of guy), but most of my friends have had their way with the rest of the menu and it doesn't disappoint.Easily one of my favorite spots in Tempe.  It's also a much larger version of its former self so you no longer have to gladly wait an hour for a table.~~#~1
You speak Italian to me and provide mouth watering, soul lifting coconut gelato with micro-chips of chocolate in them?!  I only wish you weren't 30 miles away...but I would walk in 116 degree heat to get there - for real!~~#~1
The place is a hole in the wall right behind the PHX car rental center. Arrived at dinner time, and had the best Mexican food! I had the #5 Machaca Plate w/rice, beans, & one of their homemade tortilla's burrito style. It was just amazing, and so cheap ($5.65). The only issue I have with this place is that its very well used, and looks very dirty, I did find it a bit sticky. Maybe this is a better place for pickup.  If you want a clean restaurant, their North restaurant on Cactus Road restaurant is much cleaner.~~#~1
I'll be back! Laura certainly doesn't need my review for help, but all of these people are correct.  She is meticulous, easy to be around and takes joy in her work.  When I read all of the 5 star reviews, I sort of thought they might be written by friends because they were so gushy.  I found her via Yelp.... and loved her! $20 eyebrow wax, takes credit cards.~~#~1
Awesome Mexican food, fast service at drive in or sit in and eat...try the new fish tacos, they're great, and authentic, too.~~#~1
I only ask for two things when I'm flying. To land safely. And to not fear planes while on them.US Airways only delivered on one of those, and I'm still undecided on the first one.Took a flight late from PHX to SFO. Two hours isn't too bad. Unless of course it was the longest two hours of your life and you could hear people in the cabin praying for their lives.I understand that turbulence is normal. But I would rather you cancel another flight because it is too dangerous to fly, then to put passengers through the scariest flight of their lives.Oh and when you finally do land and are thanking your maker that you are in fact still alive, its probably best that you don't have to overhear the pilots saying "Wow, that was scary. I'm surprised we landed alright."Morons. They should pay for the trauma I'll have for the rest of my life.~~#~0
This, my friends, is THE place to get some very authentic Chinese food. The servings are HUGE for what you're paying...shucks, they are huge no matter which way you look at it so be careful not to order too much food unless you want leftovers. Who doesn't like leftover Chinese food anyway?My recommendations are the Sweet and Sour chicken, the Egg Foo Yung and the chow mein. You will not be disappointed.You'll also find the soups on the back of the menu at an average of 4 bucks or so. You will be pleasantly surprised when you get the bowl...it can feed at least 6 people. She will bring small bowls out and serve it for you right at the table. Give the hot and sour soup a try.As for the service, it depends on how you look at it. Don't be afraid to get up and refill your own water. Shoot, the waitress is the only one that's there, give her a break already. She must own the joint with her husband because there is always this little kid in the corner playing on his laptop. So, get your own water and your own take home containers if you want. She doesn't have a problem with it.Yes, the place is a little worn but you don't go there to look at pretty stuff. It's not dirty, just broke down. You'd be broke down too if you practically gave away your food in abundance to your customers. Who has money for new furniture if you take care of your customers bellies.  The lobster, crab and fish are fresh and cheap. Try finding lobster somewhere else in the valley for 10 bucks a pound, I dare ya. So, head on out, just don't go on a Wednesday, that's their day off. They are open 11AM to 11PM every other day though. You can call in your order and pick it up if you don't want to look at the place.Oh yeah, and if you ever go in there and it smells horrid, it's not the place, it's a popular dish that some customers order called "Salty Fish". It stinks to all heck! If that plate comes out I usually pack up my food, giggle and finish my meal at home. I don't mind one bit, that's just the way it is.Oh and the waitress does speak good English, however, you wont find many Caucasians frequenting this place. That means the food is pretty authentic!~~#~1
Two other AC companies were going to charge me double for the same fix.  Accutemp has a new customer for life!  Highly recommend!~~#~1
If you are looking for TLC in very unique pet products and family style customer service, Posh Pet Boutique and spaW is where you need to go. They have retailed my collection of Decadent Digs there for going on 3 years, since the first day she opened her doors. I have seen her business blossom and become the destination and extra sunshine of the Troon Area. Her loving warmth (sort of Doris Day way) makes you feel like you are in her home and makes want you to come back often. She carries a huge collection of class act merchandise from cute clothes to a killer Kitty high-rise and offers excellent grooming. She is worth the trip.~~#~1
"MMMM. THIS IS. A TASTY BURGER." - Jules. Pulp Fiction.I like this place, my siblings like this place, and it's the best thing I've got to remembering better times back home in California. It's a quick fix for people who want good burgers at a decent price. It always hits the spot when I'm feeling like a fatty. :)Even considered biking all the way here from my house when my car was dead and going through the drive through. (Coz the cool kids did it back then... In CA anyway haha. And employees didn't care.)I agree that drive thru is an atrociously long wait during the afternoon (after school). Peeps who work here seem pretty chill since I always ALWAYS, ask them for the hats and throw dozens and dozens of ketchup packets in with my to-go orders. Biiiiiiiiiiig plus!~~#~1
Fresh.  Tasty.  Interesting.  Good "People Watching."Love everything I have tried here.  The Happy Hour "tapas" are excellent.  My daughter could not get enough of the garlic chicken one.The 3-bean plate is delish - kinda like "meatless chili" but you don't miss the meat.   The fruit salad is massive and the fruit served with it is completely top-notch.Wait staff is mostly cute college girls, which is hardly ever a completely bad thing.  Never had a problem with good, attentive service, which CAN be a problem sometimes.I go eat there as often as is reasonable.  Highly Recommended.~~#~1
I had one of the worst experiences of my vegetarian life here. I had been to Johnny Rocket's before and gotten the vegan option so I knew I would be ok going here. I was out with my meat eating sister and my pescatarian husband so I figured this place would be the best for all three of us to get what we want. We get in and I ordered a burger that wasn't the Streamliner (1st mistake), and just ordered it with the BOCA burger. The waitress takes our order, my husband also ordered his with a BOCA. About 20 minutes later the food comes out. The patty looks right. I was a little apprehensive and I should have gone with my gut feeling on not eating here this day, but I ignored it. It had been awhile since I had eaten a BOCA patty (over a year), so I THOUGHT it looked right. (2nd mistake)I start eating it and about half way through it the bill hits our table. It was crowded in there so the waitress must have been trying to get us out of there. So I look at the bill and notice both my husband and my burgers say Turkey substitution. I immediately start to freak out. We call the waitress over and explain to her that we ordered BOCA, why does it say Turkey? She then tells us that it is BOCA it just says turkey. I say, no that doesn't sound right. So she goes to talk to her manager I guess because we never saw her again. The manager comes over to our table and apologizes profusely for what happened. I'm upset because how the hell do you confuse BOCA and Turkey? I mean, really. I know some people might think how did I not know the difference. And I thought that to myself as well, but the truth is it slipped by me even though it shouldn't have. And it hurts me every time I think about it. I will never come to this Johnny Rockets again, if any of them ever again because of this experience. All I can say is, if you are vegan or vegetarian, and you go to any of the Johnny Rockets, make sure that your waitress/waiter knows that a BOCA burger isn't meat. Stress that to them. Because obviously they aren't trained to know what the difference is.~~#~0
Quality sushi, fun ambiance, and the chefs there are a blast to talk with. Definitely worth a visit.~~#~1
Best customer service you can find! I buy all of my reptiles and feeders from these guys!James the owner is awesome and very eager to answer any and all questions you have.he will even probe your snakes for free!Every animal i have bought from them has been in tip top shape!Their prices are great and the employees are awesome!I suggest them over any and all shops in the east valley including az reptile center and predators.Give em a shot you will be glad you did!~~#~1
Fantastic restaurant. Service was great. Food was excellent. Their happy hour from 3-7 is great. 3.00 entree's.  Everything from a 1/2 pound burger to margherita flat bread pizza is just 3.00.  Amazing appetizer is the shrimp and eggplant in black peppercorn sauce.~~#~1
Don't know where I should start. Grand opening was on September 17th, 2010. We went to try this new Dim Sum place at the Mekong Plaza as they heavily advertised in the chinese newspapers and were advertising 30% off.When I got there, the biggest eyesore is that they tried to make their portion of the Food Court as a regular "Chinese" restaurant. So imagine the picture of chandeliers hanging in the middle of a food court in the mall. It just looks too tacky, I thought they should've went with a more fast food type Dim sum like they have in San Gabriel, California.Upon checking in with the hostess, they don't even issue numbers, they only call you by name. So that was already pretty different from how usual chinese restaurant run things. Totally not efficient at all.Once we finally got a seat, things got worse.Our "Har Gow"/Shrimp dumpling was raw! The skin was thick and clumpy, the shrimp was severely undercooked. We asked them to exchange for another one, and it was still raw. We also had to exchange the shrimp egg roll as it was also raw. Their excuse was that they were too busy and did not have time to fully cook the food. Ok.....so how are the other 100s of asian restaurants able to serve dim sum at a fast pace with fully cooked food? That was probably the lamest excuse.The trademark "beef internal organs" that I always love to order was pathetic. They charged the large price for a tiny little bowl, there were only a few tendons and mostly filled with Daikon. The BBQ Pork bun, another staple of Dim sum, was not that great either. There was barely any char siu in the bun, and the exterior of the bun was not fully cooked.I understand that it is their first operating weekend, but the idea of a nice chinese dimsum place at a food court just doesn't fly in my opinion. They even offer wedding banquets here too. I don't think I'll be returning here unless they really upgrade the quality of the food. The idea is definitely novel, but will be a hard sell.~~#~0
If you have never been before you should really try harder... Your mother taught you better than that. Go and buy a smoked pecan paleta.~~#~1
We ordered.  I had to return my chicken tenders.  Undr cooked and rubbery.  My wife ordered a hamburger and is now home throwing it up.  what a horrible experience.  We have been huge fans and now this?  I called and spoke with someone who barely has a grasp on our language and they said they would get right back to me.  Still waiting My wife is in bed looking so sick.  We will never return!!~~#~0
Hot Breakfast..........NOT, Again cold food when it supposed to be hot....people beware of this over price place and lack of care for the customer it seems that this is the way of doing business.*** Again a nice place to visit but DO NOT EAT HERE.*** And DO NOT CARE!~~#~0
I absolutely LOVE Club SAR! I joined back in 2010 (I think...). At first, I just went there with my ex (who lived in So Cal and had been boxing) because I have always loved the sport of boxing and wanted to get into it myself (maybe even join the boxing team).  Sadly, I exceeded the age limit to join the boxing team, by a few years...  :-(But, at least I could still learn and get fit.  :-)We just walked up to the entrance and just took one quick look around and it seemed crowded and small so we were not impressed. So, we left.I found out this used to be just a boxing gym before but eventually they added other classes and equipment for others to enjoy. Glad I went back later on my own and found out how affordable it was!I checked and tried a few other Fitness centers and gyms nearby but, when I decided to actually try one of Club SAR's boxing classes, I was hooked! For a mere $3  (a day) drop-by fee, I was able to get one of the best workouts I ever had. I joined after I found out it only cost $75 for the whole YEAR which includes ALL the classes I can take (Boxing, boxing conditioning, Yoga, spin class, kickboxing, weight training, MMA... Yes! MMA too, which I personally love.  :-) ). Jonathan & Carlos are great and so is Tom. They're funny, friendly, and they actually remember you after only a few classes. The pricing has gone up this year but it is still by far, the BEST possible deal you can find anywhere in the Valley. Fees  YEARLY Membership  Resident    Non-Resident Adult (18+ years)       $99                  $150 Child (14-17 years)    $50                  $75 Daily Drop-In Fee $3 Residents; $5 Non-Residents If you are serious about getting fit, staying in shape and getting a good old-fashioned workout without all the "posing" and pretentiousness of other gyms which are more like "meeting places" and "meat markets" for the young Scottsdale wannabes, this gym is definitely for you!Personally, I recommend the boxing classes because they will kick your butt, they are fun, get you fit and, in shape. :-)They just got new heavy bags so there are 2 heavy bags, 1 hooks bag, several "Bob bags", 2- double-ended bags and 3 speed bags in the main workout areas. Plus, a bunch more standing weighted-base heavy bags in the other "kickboxing/Yoga room. And, in case you didn't notice from the picture, a full-size boxing ring. Yes. I am totally endorsing this gym! P.S. This is a "no frills", serious gym. So, no whinnying and crying. Suck it up and do some push-ups!  ;-)Call them for more details: (480) 312-2669~~#~1
I had an awesome experience here and highly recommend Dr. Dachs. He is here to be a good dentist, not just to get rich. His hygienist was a rock star: So nice and very gentle. I nearly fell asleep during the cleaning.I found my way to this practice after a horrible experience at another dentist just half a mile away (see my review of Belmont Dentistry on Raintree). Dr. Dachs was just so helpful and reassuring while still maintaining a very high level of professionalism. I am very thankful that my "second opinion" quest led me to him. I now finally have a top-quality dentist in Scottsdale I can trust!I definitely recommend selecting this practice. It may take a little time to get in, but it's worth it. They also work well with insurance.~~#~1
Woohoo is right. My hubby and I have gone a few times for happy hour and always enjoyed ourselves. Last night was the best so far. We were enjoying a few Left Hands and ordered the Tuesday night pizza special. It was 2 for 1 basically so we each ordered our fave. Apparently the GM thought my pizza was too done so he brought out the " burnt" one and already had another one cooking. I actually like my pizza that way but hey, I could understand where he was coming from. The second pizza was beautiful, a work of art. My husband's pie was great, all he kept saying was how great the crust was. I wil definitely bring all my friends and clients here. Special service too!  thanks again to Dan the general manager and our delicious server Reina ( sorry there isn't a better word,is there?)            Linda and Ron~~#~1
Roka Akor has a classy atmosphere, and a slightly formidable menu to pick from. Everything looks so good, and in a new environment, I want to try it all! But my date and I, after much deliberation, decided to "go for broke", as it were and if we couldn't finish, at least we had a good sample of the menu.  For an appetizer, we got the butterfish tataki and the burnt red tomato salad. These were yummy little tidbits that disappeared off the plate quickly. The butterfish was delicate, and the salad was great - the greens had all sorts of different flavors, and not that "generic clump of lettuce" flavor I hate. From the sushi menu, I was feeling adventurous and had never had raw red meat before, so I ordered the wagyu gunkan. My date saw the amount of green onions piled on top of this dish and oh-so-chivalrously gave me his piece. It's true that you needed a healthy appreciation of green onion to like these as served. The wagyu beef is ground nearly to a puree - which I wasn't expecting, and I thought the onion was a bit much. At for the skewers we ordered, my date liked his sweet potatoes the best, but I was partial to the crispy BBQ. These turned out to be two large ovoid and solid shapes of rice, run through with a skewer. Pure white sushi rice in the center, the outside was caramelized with what tasted like the sweet BBQ sauce that comes on eel sushi, which gave the whole thing a nice, crispy shell. At this point, I got to what I consider to be the crowning achievement of the meal: the yuzu marinated black cod. The cod, cooked on the robata grill in a leaf, was meltingly soft and delicately flavored. It was an effort to be share fairly. I believe my date said after our first taste of it, "Just eat what you want and I'll finish ...",  I looked up from my chopsticks, "... you know what? Just cut me off half." I wasn't sure that I could handle dessert after eating so much, but we finally decided it wouldn't be fair not to give the dessert menu a looking over, right? So we ordered the baked green tea custard, and it was a perfect pick after a gut-busting meal. Light and airy, it also had some carbonation to it that tickled my taste buds and made me giggle a lot as I was eating it.  Our sampler of shochu ranged from impressive to harsh, at least to my taste buds. In order starting with least harsh: pineapple, honeycomb, raspberry, and apple. I didn't like the last two, but the pineapple was, in my mind, a fairly dangerous thing to drink when you're not paying attention. Smooth. That's it for the food, and as for the service, it was swift and considerate; glasses were kept full, and empty plates whisked away. There was, however, one glaring exception that nearly overpowered the entire evening with its oddness. The waiter, who had up till this point been very nice and chatty, helpful about menu items, and generally a pretty cool guy, handed me his phone number and told us to call him any time we wanted to go partying.  What am I supposed to do with this? Are we going to call our waiter up and say ... well, what? It flummoxed me.~~#~1
I love this place. My gf and I go every time we visit her parents in north scottsdale. Pro'squick and easy. good service. clean. good food. good management. not too expensive. they also post nutrition info on their menu (that alone is laudable). cons,the salad dressing is quite sharp.~~#~1
This is my favorite restaurant in Tempe. The food is great with many vegetarian options. The atmosphere is usually pretty quiet and the servers are all nice. Highly recommended~~#~1
This place is everything a sports bar should be. Lots and lots of TV's...for one. I love being able to watch 4 different sports and play trivia all at the same time.The drink specials are pretty decent. They're not a dollar or anything, but the big beers are cheap on happy hour.The food is great! So far I've only tried the spinach dip, wings and their all-you-can-eat fish & chips. All of them were seriously delicious! These types of food are pretty standard in sports bars but I've definitely had my fair share of unfortunate food items from other places. These certainly surpassed my expectations.And last but not least, their star of the show, Debbie. One of the best bartenders I've ever seen. She runs that bar like a champ, knows nearly every face that walks through that door, and pours great drinks. And by great, I mean a good stiff drink that's not so strong that you can't taste anything else in it.We frequent this place quite often, and for good reason. Do yourself a favor and stop in!~~#~1
Sam, Sven, and all the vendors here make the market special.~~#~1
I am being generous with my review. I am biased since this place has been one of my favorite restaurants for years. I love it in Georgia and this place continues the tradition of rocking faces off - Italian style. I went to this locale for my birthday party with about 20 friends (unbelievable, I know). This place was more than accommodating. The waitress was fantastic, even though we were a pain in the butt come check time. I took her suggestions for our family style dinner and not one disappointed. I highly recommend the Rigatoni D and Chicken Prosciutto. Both were fantastic entrees. To top it off, we finished out with killer tiramisu. There is nothing bad I can say for this place. The atmosphere is what you would  expect from a large italian restaurant. I personally love that their waiting area is also the bar. That is just good thinking. It truly is a killer place that is perfectly nestled in north Scottsdale. I am in love...~~#~1
I searched hi and lo and had only been able to make good on the very lo with regards to good Chinese food in the Valley.  I am VERY picky and I rate most Chinese food places based on the thickness of the membrane of their won-ton soup and the colour of their fried rice.  Having passed my non doughy and not yellow test ( yup people, some places give you frozen dumplings versus fresh and yellow "Spanish Rice" in a Chinese restaurant), I was able to look into the quality of their other food items.When you can deliver Mei Fun Singapore style noodles perfectly seasoned with no greasy residue, I feel you deserve that illusive fifth star.  Service was pleasant and there was a lot of foot traffic for take away items.  I also note that they offered iced Thai tea with cream.  My buddy got a plate of broccoli, tofu, and a wonderful  Kun Pao sauce.  Sorry, but I think he created it himself and they make everything to order just for food snobs such as we.Hmmmm.  I am getting hungry. I think  I will go  there now.  Wonder if I should get their pepper steak.~~#~1
So, my friend and I went first to Yasu because we heard it was great. We were traveling on business and therefore using company plastic. So, we show up and the kid working the door says in a very "Spicolli-like" voice, "uh.... our credit card machine is broken tonight"..... So we replied that we were on expense accounts and would there be any way they could manually run our credit cards... The guy replies, "dude, you're outta luck"....Funny, considering that I am a guy who eats out a lot and am not afraid to spend a lot of money in a place when the food and service is good... I wont be going back in there...So we made our way to Hiro..... We were pissed and hungry after driving around and dealing with idiots all over town. Hiro was just what the doctor ordered. We sat down and were greeted and served drinks right away. We put our sushi order entirely in the hands of our chef who did not disappoint. He brought out order after order of fresh delicious sushi and sashimi... We had beer, sake and a great night.... When it was said and done, we spent about $250 for the two of us which was a lot but well worth it..... I'm sure you could go and have a great meal for much less, but we were going big and NOT PAYING!!!!!  Morale of the story is that Yasu's children working that night ran us out and straight to their competition where we will be spending money in the future... Go check out Hiro!~~#~1
Tuck Shop is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Phx. Everything is superb from the service to drinks to food to overall experience. Definitely go soon!~~#~1
This subway is one of the cleanest, and most efficient subways I have EVER been to.  I've only been in the evenings, but I have to say every time I walk in, someone is always cleaning something.  Their employees are friendly and the food under the glass is fresh looking and appetizing and in their own bins.  Sometimes you can go to a subway and the prep area is a wreck. Thats what makes this Subway so great. Everything is in it's place, and orderly and makes you feel like they take pride in their work.  Absolutely I will go here again, and I can't say that about many Subways unfortunately.~~#~1
Its not a standard restaurant as it is in the middle of a grocery store...but thats just what it is get over it!  The food however is fantastic!  I ordered the samosa chaat...A samosa covered in chick peas and other sauces and chatney.  A delicious Punjabi snack!  The portion was very generous and the price cheap.  I also recently ordered a dozen samosas to bring home and serve at a dinner party.  Very convenient and good service.  I will be a regular from now on!~~#~1
As one of my fave restaurant's in Scottsdale, the Herb Box is the perfect place for a great patio and lunch. At dinner the atmosphere is subtly romantic with string lights illuminating the patio. Other than the ambiance, the food is some of the best fresh local food I've tasted. A personal favorite is the Free Range Chicken with Goat Cheese... Can you say tasty? My mouth waters just thinking about it. Walking in, the crew at the Herb Box is some of the friendliest you'll ever meet (and the funniest). When you go, make sure to save room for dessert... the cheesecake of the moment is always a win!~~#~1
I was referred to Jones Family Dentistry for an emergency procedure. I cannot express how incredible the staff and doctors were. I appreciate all the time and help they gave me. The follow up phone call really showed how caring they are. AMAZING Dentists!!! My family has a new dentist. Thank you!!!~~#~1
Being from San Antonio I missed Rudy's so much! This Arizona location is similar, but different. The BBQ is definitely a winner, but their now commercialized packaged BBQ sauce is horrible! Bring back the other stuff in the Styrofoam containers! I will still keep coming for the brisket when I'm in the area!!!!!~~#~1
Sunridge Canyon has been one of my very favorite courses since I first played it 6+ years ago. I have to admit I did work here for a two-year span several years ago, but it was one of my favorites before, during, and since then.It's not as hyped as Grayhawk, Troon, and some other courses but it's just as great of a layout, if not better than some of the more popular high-end courses in the valley (definitely better than the overrated Grayhawk). The course has the rare distinction of being very playable yet very challenging at the same time. You'll be toast if you don't hit it fairly straight on most holes, but you won't be punished for hitting it where you intended like some of the blind-shot-heavy courses (i.e. We-Ko-Pa) here in the valley. I've shot in the 70s one day and in the 90s the next out there.Besides the superb and scenic layout, I also like the simplicity of the overall complex. It's not at a big resort, there aren't multiple courses, and there is no grand clubhouse (not that all those things are always bad). It's just the 18 holes, pro shop, and a restaurant that serves up some pretty solid food. The staff is friendly and helpful, too. It's like a neighborhood course albeit a high-end one. They have some great summer rates for locals this summer: Any day, any time for only $35. I recommend all valley golfers to enjoy that rate while it lasts. I played yesterday and the course was in good shape tee-to-green, and outstanding shape on the greens. It's been awhile since I've seen greens roll this well on a $35 course here in town.One last, but important, note: It gets WINDY out here. As in, it gets windy every day. The course plays through a canyon and the winds are swirling all the time. An early morning tee time is best since it gives you your best chance to take on the uphill back-nine without the wind gusting in your face.~~#~1
Inside the Clarendon Hotel in central Phoenix, Gallo Blanco has quickly made a hit for themselves with hipsters and urban dwellers alike. They offer a refreshing alternative for hotel restaurants, with lively ambiance and great food and drink.Gallo Blanco's tacos are surefire hits. They're served individually, and come lined up in an appealing silver taco stand. We've ordered the carne asada and shrimp soft tacos, and, wow, they're really mouthwatering. The shrimp is flame grilled and seared, bringing out a nice full flavor. The guacamole is slightly sweet and chunky, and paired with outstanding tortilla chips, this is a must-order appetizer. Even the sauces (I prefer the red chipotle one) are addictive, either to accompany the supreme tacos, or to be enjoyed alone on chips.This restaurant is a fine addition to the emerging downtown Phoenix foodie scene, and with prices extremely reasonable, you get a lot. A good sized meal for two (sans drinks) could ring up at $30-35, which is a good value for great food. Try Gallo Blanco, bring friends, and get a bunch of items. Although I haven't explored the rest of the menu, I sense that Gallo Blanco's items don't stray far from excellence.~~#~1
I love pueblo pediatric also!  And, also surprised there aren't any reviews!There staff is always friendly and helpful. Rooms are always clean. I take my baby to Dr. Salek. He always answers all of our questions and never makes us feel "stupid" for asking. He also takes his time and even asks us how we are doing. Most physicians these days are in and out of the room before you can even feel like your questions are answered, but Dr. Salek really takes his time. I went in during a very busy day...flu season actually.  My baby had a fever and I called the office to fit me in. They did surprisingly and I saw Dr. Salek. He examined my baby and reassured me his fever is fighting off infection and not to worry.  Well as any mom, I was worried and continued with my questions...I was there for 30 min with him and not once did he make me feel rushed. I even thanked him for squeezing us in and he replied "we would rather stay later to see all our sick patients than to send you to urgent care because we are overbooked". Now that's what I call service...if only MY doctor would fit me in and not send me to urgent care!I haven't seen the other physicians but am sure they are just as good! Also, they are a private practice from what I know so each physician owns part of the practice...meaning they take pride in what they do!~~#~1
In a never ending quest to find new lunch spots me and a coworker stumbled upon this place. Hearing it from another person we were originally looking for somewhere else.Overall I thought the food was excellent. A generous portion, and a price you can't beat. A little difficult to order but got exactly what we wanted. Only problem I can see is no where to sit. So you have to take it to go. Still worth it.~~#~1
Move over Jacques Torres! Angela has come to town and just might be the next big thing for Phoenix (and the confectionary world!) I happened to find this place just on a whim....I was reminiscing the other day about all the wonderful chocolatiers in other big cities, and it occured to me 'maybe there is a chocolatier in Phoenix?'  Sure enough, there is!! (thanks yelp!) and she's GOOD!!!! Angela is as sweet as her candy is! She explained how she just started this business in October of last year; she is a self-taught, talented and creative, as authentic as it gets, chocolatier! She uses all organic ingredients, including fair-trade organic chocolate. You will find many whimsical truffle flavor creations like Raspberry Rose, Mudslide, Strawberry Balsamic, Lavender Lemonade, Madras Curry, Avacado Wasabi, Maple-Smoked Bacon (yeah, I KNOW!)....and like a million more! AND the best news of all, is that she says she has perfected a dairy-free recipe for truffles...I. CAN'T. WAIT! I hope I'm the first to order that batch!! Besides beautiful, flavorful truffles, she makes her own marshmallows (in various amazing flavors as well) Chocolate Bark (which is always dairy-free) and even different hot chocolate mixes. The most amazing thing of all is....now, get ready for this....all of this magic comes right out of her home kitchen!! THAT means, everything is made with *love* :)  So, if you happen to yelp this, like I did, the map will actually take you to her business, which is located in her house, in a neighborhood (a little confusing at first....) but it IS LEGIT! She said normally it's by appointment only (I was not) but she gladly had me in and I got to see some of her gastronomic creations anyways (yay!) However, she says that she normally sells her stuff at the South Scottsdale Farmers Market (Wednesdays) and the Tempe Farmers Market (on Warner and McClintock on Saturdays) In fact, if you go to her website, you can customize a box of chocolates and pick it up at the farmers market of your choice... (can't wait to do this!!)Needless to say, this made my day...no, like, my week! SO excited to have a real, gourmet chocolatier right in my own neck of the woods! Woo hoo!!~~#~1
Bomb .....................................................................................................................Heated toilet seats~~#~1
Just went to this theater last night, and it was great!  Started with friendly staff...every one of them! (not common these days)  Went to get a popcorn, and the nice girl suggested...."why don't you press your button at your seat and someone will come serve you!  Take advantage of the service!"  We went to our seat and after we pressed the service button, someone came within a few minutes.  There was a full menu at our fingertips...including alcohol and specialty coffees.  Our seats were comfortable, leather (or pleather), roomy, we could stretch out our legs without touching the chairs in front of us, we had 3 cup holders between the both of us, and the seats leaned back.  Not a bad seat in the theater...we got to pick our seats BEFORE we went into the movie on a touch screen computer/pad.  I'm really impressed with the prices, too, because for just $2 more than a regular, cramped, loud, teenager-infested movie theater, we felt like we were getting First Class treatment, all night!  The snack, food and drink prices are typical for a movie theater; but not more than it would be elsewhere.  Pretzel was about $4.50 and Hummus was about $6.50 for example.  I'm sad to read Ruth Ann's review because it sounds like an isolated incident, and it also sounds like they did a lot to take care of the issues she had...an experience can't be absolutely perfect.  In my case, there was a little bit of stickiness near my cup holder, but that's not something that will bring my experience down an entire star or 3! Go to this theater!  It's really a great night out! (As long as you like the movie you pick, which we did :)~~#~1
House special chicken is a must. This is not a fancy schmancy place so you know the food will be good! Never have had to wait for a table. The banana thingies they give you for dessert are awesome too. I give it 5 stars because of the huge selection. Pei Wei and PF Changs are ok but they have a limited menu. And a LARGE wait!~~#~1
Some of my friends brought me here last night and the first thing that came into my mind was that this was a set up for To Catch A Predator. I was ready for Chris Hansen to pop out and grill me with, "What are you doing here?" If you feel like Kubrick's Lolita really speaks to you, as in it mirrors your life, then you've found a place to feel comfortable in your pervert skin.If you're of age to consume alcohol, they've got a bar here. The thing about this bar though is that they're really sloppy about pouring drinks, ie. a Manhattan should not taste like a barber's cleaning solution. The decor and set up of this place really needs a face lift.A few pluses though... If you're under 21, I could see how this would be appealing. I'll admit that the under-21 clubs that I went to when I was under 21 were fun, but now that I think about them they really suck. It seems like an alright experience if this is your first step into the club/bar world. The DJ's here spin pretty much straight hip-hop which is fine, it's very mainstream though and nasty bumping music.If you go here you're one of three types of people:1) You were dragged here by your friends2) You're under 21or, 3) Your usual excuse is a heart-felt plea, complete with waterworks, that goes something along the lines of, "I swear, Officer, I thought she was 18!!!!"~~#~0
These girls know how to make working out awesome and fun!!!! Quality instructors, will not disappoint!!! Lots of variety!!!~~#~1
As a Massage therapist I really need to get worked on to make up for all the massages I give.  Kristi is my go-to massage therapist.   With over 20 years of experience in the healing arts she's got amazing strength and sensitivity.   AND--she's a great listener--it's kind of like getting a counselor and therapist all in one shot.  It's the best hour of my week!  "~~#~1
We made a last minute decision to go out on New Year's Eve.  The restaurant was very busy but after just a few minutes a couple of seats opened at the bar ( our favorite place to sit) and the bar tenders, Blake, Kennan and Clair were ON IT!  They were very busy, but did not miss a new face at the bar or a glass writing for a refill.  The food was excellent. My husband had the baseball steak with twice baked potato and I had Prime Rib  with lobster tail and twice baked potato. Everything was cooked to perfection. Oh yes! Start with the garlic cheese bread as it is yummy!~~#~1
Greatness in the form of food, just like the other locations. The service was particularly good at this location. We sat at the bar,and while the other customers were mildly annoying, the late night bartenders were up beat, witty, and very personable.The atmosphere was par for the course.All in all, if you are reading this review, get your directions to this location, close the browser, and go eat!~~#~1
Awesome, delicious lunch or dinner takeout place! Quite a dive in terms of decor, so don't expect anything fancy. There are folding tables and chairs, if I remember correctly.Anyway, I had jade red chicken and emperor's chicken quesadilla and both were SO GOOD. The idea of Chinese - Latino food sounds odd, but I'd heard of it before and just never had the chance to try it. They have all sorts of combos, mostly with beans or rice as a side (get it? chinese and latin food both usually come with rice....!). So before you knock it, if you're in Phoenix and looking for a place to eat, this is it!~~#~1
in addition to sucking, it's also expensive.~~#~0
I can't believe I haven't wrote a review for Ted's yet! By far, one of my favorite places to go. You can get full off of some tasty food for a great price. I normally get a hot dog with mayo, onion, hot sauce and a pickle. I also like the corn dog and onion rings. I can always get a satisfying and fulfilling meal for $5-7. Love it!Can get a little crowded on the weekends, but generally all the people are pretty fast and nice.~~#~1
Great place to go before heading to the zoo. Not a lot of seating if you're with a big party~~#~1
These guys know their stuff.  Professional staff and great location.~~#~1
From the moment we walked in the door we were treated like celebrities. I wish I was one after leaving here! The food was some of the best Thai we've ever had, and I live in Chicago and have tasted dishes more than a dozen different authentic Thai restaurants. We never were without a glass of water or a full glass of wine. I wish I lived here so I could make this a regular stop during my weekly Thai and Sushi cravings. The Tilapia was out of this world - topped off with a delicious medley of mint, onions and lemon leaves. I highly recommend the Spring Rolls - very fresh and tasty! Give this place a try - you won't be disappointed.~~#~1
Visited this great place last week with my parents and sister and we all had a great time!  The service was a bit "in the weeds" but everyone was friendly and nice and the food was very good.  The tour is worth the $5 and then some, very informative, and our guide was very funny and knew her stuff!  products for sale are lovely and the  drive is worthwhile.  It is a bit way out but it was different and a great way to spend Sunday.  GPS do not like the address so try google maps and your phone/ipad it will get you there.~~#~1
This place is great.  All the food is fresh and always good.  They have a great happy hour daily with a very knowledgeable staff.  I highly recommend this place.~~#~1
Attention all parents, nannies, guardians etc.  Koko bees is tons of fun!  The kids are all smiles & full of laughter.  Terrific environment:  oodles of play houses,  dress ups, costumes, toys, themes & settings!  The little ones imaginations can run wild.  They even offer fantastic dance, sports, yoga and tumbling classes for the children!  This is a great place to come with the kiddos!!~~#~1
I split the veggie platter with a friend and we only got just over half way through it.  Got the rest to go.  I couldn't wait until I had room to eat again so I could eat the leftovers.  Sooo much good stuff.  I'm usually not a glutton, but there are a precious few places where I lose all self control and beach myself and this is apparently one of them.We were there for an hour and half and asked all sorts of questions about how things were made and what they were.  The lady that waited on us may have been the owner.  She was cheerful and happily indulged our questions.It's a large restaurant with plenty of seating for large groups, but it also seems to be an authentic family outfit.  They have a few beers in bottles and apparently authentic music.I'm sad that I'm moving out of this neighborhood right as this moved in!  If I weren't leaving, I'd probably give up cooking entirely and just eat here every day, or try to get take-out.If you're downtown or on the east side of Phoenix, it's worth the trip.  Really good ethnic places outside of the Italian/Chinese/Mexican/American mold are a treasure here in Phoenix.  If you're from somewhere more metropolitan, you know what I'm talking about.   West Bring friends, dates, clients, and employees here and impress them.~~#~1
Our bartender was rude and impersonal, to start. When my wife ordered a diet coke, you could see her disdain. We saw her once more, when she took our food order, after which she sat in the corner and ate. The remaining staff dropped off our food without a word, and never came back; in fact, I had to flag down the manager to get cashed out. The food was sub par. My wife's Shepard pie was all mashed potatoes, and my chicken strips were incorrect and with the wrong side. Also, my fries were soggy because they had been placed over excess sauce. Poor food, awful service, overpriced beer. Visit the Kyrene location or don't go at all.~~#~0
Bruce saved my day, my computer crashed this morning and I gave him a call and he was able to come out same day.  He went through my whole system at my office and even updated my anti-virus with a free AVG instead of paying for that crappy Norton service.  He was able to go through and recover all my files and found out the operating system was corrupted.  He saved my day and completed everything same day.  Thank you Bruce!~~#~1
went down to Scottsdale for Spring Training (Go Giants!) and we decided we wanted to have a nice, sit down meal instead of bar food or ballpark food every day/night.  Eddie's House fit the bill perfectly.Food - excellent.  Tuna Tartar "nachos" were great.  I had the scallops and they were perfectly cooked.  Also had a size of Fiddler's Ferns which I've only tried once before.  they were excellent.  Berry Cobbler for dessert also excellent.  Service - excellent.  very nice waiter who was very attentive.Location - close to downtown but not on the immediate Scottsdale Road path.  Atmosphere - also excellentPrices - being from San Francisco, the prices were unbelievably reasonable.~~#~1
I rented bikes here for the first time today and took them for a ride on the green belt.  It was so fun and the husband and wife working the shop were so friendly and helpful! I will definitely be a returning customer and recommend this to people who are looking for a fun outdoor activity.~~#~1
Love this spot - it's pretty close to the convention center so Natalie and I went here to check it out. The bacon is awesome here!Their philosophy is great too - local, organic, etc. etc.  The place is tiny and quaint too and as always it's great to support a local independent business.  Best breakfast in Phoenix that i've had and definitely one of my fave spots - went there the next day too - got the special and it was delish - check my photos to see what we got!~~#~1
The name is so misleading, because this is the most charming dining spot I've ever eaten! I dined here for lunch with a friend and was blown away by everything about it. First, it's location is tucked away near ASU campus in a quiet little neighborhood. It appears to be a converted home built in the early 1900's and lots of beautiful mature trees and plants growing in their huge, and I mean huge outdoor patio area. I only dined outside, but honestly with such beautiful weather 9 months out of the year here, why would you dine any other way! The service was excellent! The staff was extremely attentive and always checked up on me while I drank water and waited a while for my friend. The menu was amazing. I never once read a menu that I wanted to try everything on here. They had a huge variety of dishes at what I can only describe as American/French fusion. It all looked so divine. And from what I've been told, their menu changes frequently to new seasonal dishes. So I can't wait to see what they offer when I return. I went simple with my meal having this delicious quiche, fresh fruit and a cup of their corn chowder soup. The soup was so rich and creamy, I could have ordered and ate a whole trough! It was that good. The fruit was clean, well portioned and fresh. I'm very particular with fruit, and hate when the fruit looks soggy and overly ripened. And the quiche was heavenly as well. Just the right amount of ham and tomatoes with alot of flavor.Since I was here for lunch only, the prices were reasonable. I've heard at dinner it can get expensive.This was an unforgettable dining experience and recommend this to everyone to try at least once.~~#~1
Amazing.Fogo de chao is nothing short of out of this world. It is expensive, but as soon as you start, you'll know exactly where that money went.Seriously. Try it.~~#~1
Man the chompie sliders is the bomb.  Wish there were some in LA.  Man taste so good and flavor.~~#~1
The sushi was fresh and excellent! The service was almost too fast. I did not find the prices to be out of line with the quality.  Our daughter loved the miso soup. The one thing I really appreciated is that they will make what you want, whether it is on the menu or not. If they have it, you can get it. I know we'll be going there often. One thing though, this is a busy, noisy place. It is not large either. If you are looking for quite and relaxed, this perhaps isn't the best choice. If you want good food in a noisy cheerful atmosphere, like a bunch of friends or after work, this fits the bill.~~#~1
Great place to take the kids to play and have some bbq. Nice outdoor area and good solid bbq.~~#~1
If I won the lottery and just wanted to spend a few hours a week working, it would have to be in this store.  One, because I would want to be there just to see all the THINGS all the time, and two, because I would be able to spend all my money there.  This place rocks.This place has three buildings- the west one has pricier items, but the stuff is GORGEOUS (see previous lotto winning comment).  The east one has very reasonably priced items, contains seasonal trinkets and specialty food items.  The south building has kids stuff, pet items and clothing/purses as well as some home items.  It is the BEST place to find a gift for someone, or spend your overtime check on something nice for yourself. Want nice stationary?  A cute soup tureen?  A garden item? New collar for your dog? Fake fruit for your centerpiece?  Gorgeous picture frames?  Cute gauzy dress?  Hip handbags? Pretty bangles?  Antique key holders?  Whimsical signage? Artful platters?  Decorative bird cages?  Catch my drift?  They have EVERYTHING! :)~~#~1
Worse pizza I have had in a while. We ordered 3 slices and they tasted like they had been sitting out for a while and nuked. Crappy service too. Salad was plain and all oil no vinegar for dressing. . Service half ass. I am surprised they have remained in business fo several years. Also they apparantly have no AC it was VERY warm inside even on a slightly chilly day in Nov so we sat outside the inside was so hot and stuffy. this place totally sucks.~~#~0
Love the convenience store. I stop every morning for a soda on my way to work.  They are friendly, efficient and clean.~~#~1
I threw my friends bachelorette party here this Sat and had an amazing time! Though this place is very fancy and classy they are super laid back with the partying and drinking. Makes for a perfect mix! We went all out and got a table with bottle service and two rooms to stay in. They gave us a bottle of champagne for free and brought it up to the room for us to toast which was cool. We had 18 girls in two rooms and we didn't get one complaint! We stayed at shade, the club upstairs by the pool, until 2am and then changed into our swimsuits to go for a dip in the pool. I love how the pool never closes so you can drink all night long! Shade also plays great music which we loved. Good mix of different stuff so everyone was happy.I did have a little bit of issues with the woman who booked our table. Her name was Haley. She was not very responsive and didn't return my calls, emails or texts. I wanted to decorate our table but wasn't sure what was allowed and she never answered my questions. But the night of the party I mentioned this to the manager and she brought us a free bottle of champagne and sincerely apologized for the trouble. This was enough of a redemption for us. It couldn't have went better! Thank you W for an awesome and memorable night!!~~#~1
a weekend of debauchery was spent here when i was 18.  somehow we broke two lamps that were hanging on the walls.  like high up on the walls.  like above head level.  don't ask, because i don't remember how it happened either.  we tried to steal lamps from other rooms, but the maids kept catching us.  so we wrote, "I O U 2 LAMPS :(" on one of the lampshades and left it at that.  one night, my friend jonathan got really drunk and angry and lonely, went to the pool, and threw all of the poolside furniture into the pool.  we seriously destroyed that motel.  i'm not kidding, there was so much filth in one of our rooms that you couldn't see the carpet.  i felt really, really bad for whoever had to clean that up.  but the best part was that we didn't get charged for any damage we caused.  thanks, motel 6!no wonder my useful points are so low... i use yelp more often to showcase my anecdotes than to actually review things.  i'm useless!~~#~1
I just finished my G & S meal that I ordered to-go; actually, I just finished throwing it out. It was HORRIBLE. And by horrible, I mean shamefully bad. And by shamefully bad, I mean, heinous! I had a very disappointing experience here about a year ago but I thought I would give it another try. I should have proceeded with caution when I asked the long-term employees at the neighboring Blockbuster what was good and to the person, they all stammered and failed to reply. Seriously, zero out of four could give me one "great" dish! I've lived in both Mpls & Chicago and my Ex used to travel the Orient and we were always surprised at how POOR the quality of Asian food was in this area and WHY the people here, seemed to like it!? It's absolutely baffling!I had the Orange Beef & Spring Rolls. The Orange Beef looked scarey right in the container. But when i ate it - UGH! The texture was all off and the sauce..... it had these big, clear, GELATINOUS, ..... ugh ugh ugh! I can't even talk about it. Like biting into a ball of corn-starchy orange extract! I'm still sick from those few bites! [Truly.] And while I ordered vegetable spring rolls, I got what tasted like low-quality hamburger meat! In fact I finally identified the flavor and texture as: SAUSAGE! It was like an Asian Spring Roll with chunks of Italian Sausage inside!! How's that for a combo? Ugh...... [stomach turning]I'm sorry, I'm a Single Parent and I'm usually grateful to have someone cook for me. Grateful even when i am paying. But during "tough times" when i actually "treat" myself and then plunk down $20(!!) for unedible... yuck - it's totally, TOTALLY unacceptable! Shame on you, George, for offering such little quality control and not aspiring to a higher standard overall. No wonder the place was (not) hopping on a Saturday night!Simply one of the worst meals EVER.~~#~0
NOTE: This review concerns the Roberto's on Union Hills and 7th Ave. NOT the Roberto's in Anthem!I am only giving it one star because I can't give it 0. Simply put i was very sick after dining there recently. This was the only meal I did not share with my family and therefor the only culprit to my food borne illness. I have enjoyed this place in the past but recently the quality has gone downhill. Now they are closed on Sunday's.I wish i had read recent reviews on here before i had gone. they have slipped VERY far since there Diners Drive-ins and Dives days. the guy that both took my order and cooked my food was obviously drunk. sitting on his cellphone playing what appeared to be a video game when i walked in.~~#~0
After stepping off the plane hungry, I looked around the terminal for food as I walked to the next gate. "Wait a minute, I'm in Arizona. I should get some southwestern style food or mexican food. Is that a burrito place? Surely it can't be bad." I ordered a #1, standard burrito. I take a bite. And another. "Not bad I thought." Then I took another bite. And promptly spit it out.The cheddar cheese in my burrito was moldy. And no, I'm sure it wasn't blue cheese. It was even obvious visually. After pointing the cheese out to the manager, she brushed it off as "the bag was just opened, it's not possible" even after showing the obvious mold. People around me started looking uncomfortable. Someone muttered "wow" and stepped out of the line.The best part? I wasn't even offered a refund or a new burrito, or an apology for the moldy burrito. Are you kidding me?~~#~0
I used to love Quiznos.... I would go out of my way to get a turkey bacon guacamole sandwich any day. At this point in my life I will no long be giving any money to this sorry excuse for a sandwich shop. The staff is rude and careless. I was given obviously bad guacamole... Which I didn't realize until i got home a took a bite of my sandwich to have the fowl taste in my mouth. It took 20 mins to get my sandwich, there was only one couple in front me. I'm done with this place. I should have went to paradise bakery across the street.~~#~0
If you're willing to run out for lunch a little early, enjoy the lively patio atmosphere will dining on yummy vittles.A When-Harry-Met-Sally picky eater, I, um, grilled the waiter on seafood's sustainability and ingredient origin, and he was good-natured and knowledgeable.A perfect eatery for a casual date or girls' day out. Yay!~~#~1
MY EXPECTATIONS WERE EXCEEDED!  I've been searching for so long to have a dinner experience that MET all of my expectations - for a restaurant that I SHOULD NEVER PATRONIZE.  Mimi's in Goodyear actually exceeded my expectations.  On Oct 26th, while visiting the area, I made the unfortunate mistake of recommending we dine at Mimi's because of previously good food and service there.  But, alas, if the old Mimi's quality still existed, they wouldn't have exceeded my expectations for WHAT NOT to experience in a restaurant.Let me recant why YOU or ANY ONE ELSE (except those people you truly dislike) should never patronize this facility.  First of all, the interior temperature was at least 80 degrees (when it was less than 65 outside).  We had to ask for the air conditioning to be turned on.Next, we ordered the artichoke dip appetizer.  It looked funny.  It tasted funny.  The tortilla chips actually resembled pita chips.  If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, it must be a ______.I ordered the chicken cordon bleu which is supposed to be served with "seasonal vegetables" and "homemade mashed potatoes".  Can someone explain to me how MIXED seasonal vegetables can be served where the brocolli is steaming hot, but the carrots mixed with them are literally still frozen in the middle?  That's a feat.  My "homemade" mashed potatoes?  Cold.  A sliver of butter placed on top of the mashed potatoes would not even melt to graphically show our waitress "the problem" .  Even after this effort, no offer from the wait staff (or manager-missing-in-action) was ever made to either warm up the potatoes, replace them ......or, perhaps, use them as wall spackling.After all this, they sincerely asked us if "everything was all right" and "would we care to order dessert".  At least they have a sense of humor.Never again.~~#~0
A philosophical elder of my profession commonly says "Everyone needs three vices.  Sex and chocolate don't count."  If I still lived in Phoenix, LoLo's Chicken and Waffles would definitely be one of my vices.  The chicken is pure fried goodness. The mac n'cheese is creamy and crispy goodness. The waffles are BEYOND DELICIOUS.  If I could give any future LoLo's consumers a hint it would be this: if you are sensitive to too much sugar like I am, don't waste your precious pancreatic islets on the beverages.  I succumbed to the peer-pressure and got an Arnold Palmer, which of course comes in a quart-sized Mason jar.  I reached my sugar capacity before the meal even started.  I can only imagine the explosion of flavor in my mouth I would have experienced had I not wasted all my buds on sweetened tea and lemonade.~~#~1
Yum!  The toasted barley app is delicious. My boyfriend and I shared the eggplant sandwich and the monk burger. Both of the sandwiches were outstanding. The service was great too. We will definitely go back.~~#~1
I am giving this location 5 stars cause its been my stomping grounds for atleast 12 years now, its always very good, clean, and I have never had a bad experience here. Wendys locations are just class acts, they are always my go to burger fix. I also made this my daughters first burger when she wanted to finally try one so she could have a good experience for the first one and always have a tasty burger to judge the rest by for her life. If its good enough for my daughter, then its good enough for you :) eat up and review.~~#~1
The location has closed (AGAIN).  Not good if you have prepaid washes or other credits as the business has closed.  Some speculation on other sites is that they have filed for bankruptcy again.Don't bother stopping by to use their services as the facility is cordoned off and a big sign says "business closed".~~#~0
I think this is the best fast mexican food in Chandler or the surrounding area.  The food quality is high and consistant.  The prices are downright CHEAP.  I really like the bean and cheese burritos and the chili relleno burritos.  The jalapenos and carrots are a must and I am thrilled that they started selling Tamarindo.~~#~1
Best pasta I have ever had. Don't go there if you're looking for a two-pound chicken parm or endless breadticks.~~#~1
This is my new addiction! Took some friends and family here to celebrate my mom's birthday, it was her first time and she had a blast. Our first chef Poncho isn't at this location any more which we were disappointed about but ended up having another great chef named Sam. He was funny and the food was great! I tried grilled shrimp for the first time and I am a fan. Our waitress was awesome! On top of everything, funny and she told us Sam was the head chef and that it was an honor to have him cook our food and that she was so glad we got him, seeing that it was the first time for almost everyone in our group to try a place like this.We have also had dinner on the patio when it was cooler out and enjoyed it too. I will be eating here often.Thanks Hayashi for always making my dining experience fun and delicious~~#~1
This is the only work of his that I have seen in person. After living in the valley since 2002, I FINALLY decided to head out that way.  I found the information about the life and times of Frank Lloyd and his 3rd wife very interesting. The house was amazing and beautiful. I especially loved the local rocks cast into the concrete, and the lines that created a flow.   I would highly recommend this tour to any one with an interest in form, function, and beauty.~~#~1
First off the woman who answers the phone is not impressive at all.   I called to consign my furniture and when I asked her about some info on the store,, she said " do you want to consign your table or not!".  Quite rude.  That was a turn of for me.....The next day I went in the store for some info but when I entered I knew this wasn't the right fit for my Robb & Stucky table.  The place had older style furniture..dated couches, florals, mauves.  There was one accessory that I would  buy in the whole store.  Needless to say, I won't be coming back or consigning my table or anything else...rude stuff + gross stuff...what more can I say!~~#~0
I love Gabriel. He does an amazing job every single time I'm there. I generally get two peekaboo highlights put in, and a cut and style, and always leaving looking great. His attitude is always upbeat, it would be impossible to spend any time in his chair and not leave in a good mood. The salon is always clean and comfortable. I never feel like I'm being forced into spending more money or buying product, but when I have a question about what I should be using in my hair Gabe always makes excellent suggestions. I have recommended him a good friend and my mother and both love him. My mother even left her stylist of 10 years to start going to him because of the excellent service he provides.~~#~1
If you want a good meal that will fill ya up, for a fair price...Wally's is a great choice!The menu has great variety.  If you want a burger, there are many to choose from.  Each is huge and juicy, and comes with your choice of a side....go with the blended fries that include deliciious sweet potato fries.Want a salad?  Again, many to choose from...my favorite is the chinese chicken.  And, in case you missed my earlier comments, expect a BIG salad.And, if you're not watching your calories, then try any of their specialty mac'n'cheese dishes.  WOW!I can't comment on the desserts because I can't eat anything beyond the entrees...but, I've seen others order a dessert; they looked yummy and - you guessed it - HUGE!And, here's the thing about Wally's:  they're "good people".  in addition to providing you with a great meal, Wally's staff are active supporters of non-profit organizations in the greater Phoenix area.  I have first-hand knowledge of their support for the Valley of the Sun Unted Way, and the Boys and Girls Clubs of Greater Scottsdale.  I have no doubt they support other causes.~~#~1
Drinking coffee from Cartel makes me want to get my own San Franciscan SF-25B Coffee Roaster, in much the same way I wanted my own pottery wheel after seeing the movie Ghost.It's. That. Good.~~#~1
At length: A trip to Kauai for our friends' wedding several years back led us to Puka Dog and the discovery of another type of holy matrimony: the perfect union of frankfurters and tropical fruit. Our friends are still together eight years later, but how my hot dogs have longed for the companionship of a little pineapple and banana relish.Disconsolate from my long lost love, I have abstained from the hot dog community (except for Ted's, because it's amazing and what happens in Tempe, stays in Tempe) until a new beau arrived: Maui Dog.In short (ish): Yummy, yummy, yummy, I've got Maui Dog in my tummy. I tried the Sweet & Spicy Dog (favorite!!!) and the Lava Dog (messy!!!) and the house made fries. Everything was delish, and I'll be back to try the rest. The restaurant is a cute, clean, pseudo-dive (kind of a Two Hippies vibe) with a few tables inside and a dog-friendly patio (tee-hee). It's funky and it's affordable. Go ahead, try it. You just might fall in love.~~#~1
The service here was wonderful, really friendly and personable. And the food was OUTSTANDING! That Brulee burger was perfection, paired with some fries and a marshmallow shake. I wanted to stay in town another day, just to come back here to eat!~~#~1
Best sushi in town.~~#~1
I have only been going to LA Fitness for about 6 months. I live in Scottsdale and work in Phoenix, so I go to the 20th St & Camelback, Scottsdale and Oak and McCormick Ranch locations.  The Scottsdale locations are GREAT! They are clean, the staff is really nice and I see people cleaning the equipment when they are done.  What is it with the Camelback crowd?  The place really smells bad! It really needs a good cleaning. There has been this big spot on the carpet in front of the womens locker room since I started.  I was on the treadmill the other day really noticing how stinky it was and then the guy next to me finished up and just walked off, I swear he was sweating like a pig, left the equipment drenched! UGH!!!  Good God! I couldn't believe it, Can't the employees make these people clean after themselves?? The reviews are right about the staff just hanging around at the front desk.....they should be cleaning something, anything.  It really is a shame that this centrally located facility is a real stinky mess!!  I can't wait for the new one to open on 7th Avenue! Maybe then they may clean up their act.~~#~0
Ok I'm very surprised by the reviews on here. I'm not one to want to write negative  reviews but our food was so bad I couldnt help myself. Maybe this place was having an off night tonight but their pizza barely had any cheese on it and the crust was soggy. Unfortunately the pizza was better than the wings that were overly breaded and soggy as well. Thank God we had a groupon and didn't have to pay full price. Won't be ordering from here again. Disappointing :(~~#~0
Be sure to see Taylor, her service is great, the food is awesome, had roast beef sandwich ...and a plank of bruschetta!  But without good service the experience lacks. Be sure to try it out.~~#~1
I am a huge "foodie", from a long line of "foodies". I grew up living in hotels and on room service and fine dining. This is the best, very best, breakfast restaurant EVER! I have been living in Tempe for about six years now, the first two sad sad years I did not know that this wonderful place existed...after my first visit, this is my go-to, best place to recommend, favorite breakfast place to eat at! If you go on a Sunday, it will be very very busy. Everyone is super friendly. The place is very clean. Prices are amazing! Cheaper or as cheap as the nasty breakfast places or fast food. Huge portions and great quality food. I have never had a bad experience here, and to be honest...even if I did, I wouldn't care. I feel like home here. Everything on the menu is delicious! I've tried almost everything. Here are a few of my favorites (don't forget though, I love it all) :O'Pear Grenache Omelette, Greek Fetash Omelette, English Harvest Omelette, Huevos Con Chorizo (with scrambled eggs), and the Blueberry Hill Girdle Cakes (pancakes! you can order half an order or little ones...we always get an order to share at the table). Their potatoes are delicious and crispy, the english muffins are great and their homemade jam is absolutely amazing! I have bought many jars of their jam to give as gifts! Just delicious! I wish everyone knew about this well kept secret. DON'T LISTEN TO ANY REVIEW UNDER A 5 STAR! This place is the best, bottom line. Try it. You will be hooked.~~#~1
It is sometimes difficult to start out busy and maintain great standards from the beginning.  The Parlor seems to be nailing it.  Hip yet comfortable decor.   Very creative design, and I loved he subtle yet present homage to the former tenant Salon de Venus.  As soon as we walked in we were greeted with a warm and sincere smile, and that same enthusiasm was felt by every single staff member we encountered.  Ah the food!  Fresh ingredients, a great light pizza crust, and an original beet salad all  had us raving.   The only minor picky foody issue was the Nectarine Crustada for dessert was luke warm at best, would have liked a nice hot dish to melt that delicious ice cream.  But why nit pic?  This place is a big hit, from the moment you walk past the fresh herb and vegetable garden,  to the fantastic staff and the  savory food, this place is already on my regular rotation.~~#~1
We were staying at the Claredon and the desk clerk (who is also from Yuma) told us that their restaurant was voted best Mex in Phoenix and she swore it was true so we had to try it.The elote (roasted corn with cheese and smokey paprika) was fab, as was the ceviche! The carne asasda taco was tasty, as so many have already said. The real stars, however, were the pork belly and vegie tacos. I'll be dreaming about those til our next trip north.~~#~1
Everytime I think of Chodang my mouth waters. I love the spicy tofu soup they serve here along with their korean style dumplings. Their portions are just right. If you don't like spicy foods you can tell them to not make it spicy. I also love the condiments they serve before the meal. Love it!I like their decor. The tables and walls really go together and you definitely feel like you're at an asian restaurant. Everything is neat and clean (even the bathrooms).~~#~1
I love this place! I've been here twice now and walked out with great finds both times. They have a large variety of clothes - work-appropriate & fun cocktail dresses, fabulous shoes, jewelry, casual skirts and shirts, and more. The employees are very friendly and helpful. Another reviewer mentioned $700 boots, but I haven't seen a single item priced over $100.  I actually got gifts for my cousins, 2 hair and jewelry items apiece, for under $20 per person (and in the same visit found a dress for less than $40 that got me half a dozen compliments at a holiday party that night!)~~#~1
After weeks of anticipation, Side Bar has finally opened.  As you ascend the staircase to the second level, the reason for the long wait becomes apparent.  The attention to detail is amazing.  Once layered with crumbling plaster, the walls were meticulously stripped to reveal the historic brickwork.  Other historic elements include the original steel casement windows that feature a view of downtown phoenix and the surrounding area. Tastefully integrated with these elements is a contemporary interior design.  The lighting consists of warm colors that set the stage for the laid back atmosphere.  No expense was spared when designing the bar and tables, which are made of dark exotic woods.  Seating included organically shaped bar stools that adjust to a comfortable height and depth.  There are also several u-shaped sofas that create conversational areas.  Behind the bar you'll see an array of artistically arranged circular openings backlit in a warm, yellow tone.  Thick glass shelving lines the back wall along with a fine assortment of liquors.  The "soft opening" menu included wines and locally brewed beers among others.  I tried a White Russian and my wife had a glass of Chardonnay.  Both were very good.  Prices seemed to be close to average for the area and when compared to the experience, were a good value.  I had a chance to speak to one of the owners who was glowing with excitement.  After two years of remodeling and working with the city and adjacent historic neighborhood, his vision has become reality.  In addition to a brief history of his endeavor, the owner informed me that additional overflow parking will be available adjacent to the main parking lot.  Parking was one concern originally voiced by the neighborhood and city.  The owners may also experiment with weekly art showings by local artists.  Maybe they can arrange for it to coincide with First Fridays.  Within walking distance of Side Bar, dining includes Pei Wei, My Florist, and Zoe's Kitchen.   If you're looking for a unique hangout in an urban setting, then Side Bar comes highly recommended.~~#~1
Went to Cracker Barrel twice while vacationing at our home in Litchfield Park.  All the food we ordered were very good and the service was good also.  I highly recommend their pancakes.~~#~1
Grassroots is right around the corner and we drive by it every week on our usual Friday-Dinner-Out.  I always assumed it was more of a pub than a restaurant.  My wife and I arrived around 5:00pm and were seated immediately.  The waiter was super attentive and knew the menu and preparation of everything I asked about.  We started with an AMAZING appetizer special of burrata* with ciabatta tips, their house spicy tomato jam and arugula with champagne vinaigrette.  It was described as a sort of an experimental combination of preparations from other dishes.  The burrata was silky smooth and spreads onto the ciabatta like softened cream cheese.  The play of flavors in this dish was excellent, we'd go back here just for this dish alone.My wife ordered the lobster bisque as her entree, which was smooth and creamy with a good lobster flavor.  I suspect we could have asked for bread on the side, but it didn't come with it by default.I ordered the short ribs with roasted asparagus and jalapeno cheddar grits.  The ribs were cooked just right, just a little pink and tender with a concentrated glaze of delicious sauce layered on top.  The sauce had a light smoky flavor with a fair amount of saltiness, and appeared to be a long simmered reduction with bold flavor. As others have mentioned, the jalapeno grits are very good, not spicy by any means but a little crunch from the jalapeno pieces, creamy and well prepared.  I strongly recommend the short ribs to anyone.We splurged with dessert of key lime pie and a banana split.  The split included three large scoops of (what appeared to be) homemade ice cream and topped with caramelized pecans.  The key lime was tart and delicious.The portion sizes were perfect and considering the careful preparation and unique flavors the price was appropriate.  It's a little more expensive that I would like to put Grassroots into our weekly rotation, but I look forward to visiting it again and sample more items off the menu when the budget allows.* I didn't know what burrata was: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrata~~#~1
This is my love note:Yours beers are so delicious, your food is absolutely scrumptious.  I wish I could spend forever and always with you.  If I could just never work and sit inside of you all day eating and drinking, why, I think I would be the happiest gal on this side of the Mississippi River.  You are great, don't change, and please, stay with me forever and always.I love you to the moon and the stars Handlebar,Katlan~~#~1
This location is now closed.~~#~0
I stayed at the Motel right across the street from this restaurant when I stayed in Gila Bend. I had been driving all day through the hot desert and really wanted to kick back with a cold beer and some good food. Little Italy did not disappoint!! I got a large pizza that was AMAZING!! Plus the service was great too. Fast and friendly.~~#~1
Chef Bianco does it again! The homemade pasta is unreal. You can actually taste the freshness of all of the ingredients. The pasta is thick (like homemade pasta is supposed to be...) but not heavy at all. I also loved the casual vibe and the staff was very friendly and nice. You really feel like a guest sitting in the kitchen in a home somewhere in Italy.~~#~1
Why can't the attendant understand a simple direct question?Can someone please tell me just where the Hell I'm supposed to put my freakin' drink?and worst of all ... my balls don't fit in this place.*one extra star for the bartender offering me her personal lighter *minus the extra star for not having any matches~~#~0
Out of business~~#~0

I can't believe we get to review a free publication.  Nonetheless, it's important to know (especially for Dave B., who obviously didn't do his research) that this magazine is published by a gentleman who grew up here in the valley and wanted a way to promote all of the great, creative people and activities they are doing by making a free magazine.  He decided this 17 years ago, and, despite pretty much breaking even (it costs money to print and distribute thousands of magazines and no, the ads do not cover the full cost), continues doing so in the name of cultural awareness.  Notice that the photoshoots use local designers, local models, local photographers, and local locations.  The articles are about artwork currently displayed in local galleries, businesses (like restaurants) and bands that local folks have started on their own from meager means, and about up-and-coming events like the taco festival (started by a local), fashion shows (again, utilizing local designers and run by locals - no Dillard's show coverage here) and about people in the valley who are trying to make a difference in our community.  If the magazine doesn't seem critical enough, it's because the people who are the magazine decide what to write about, and therefore don't have to waste pages with hateful criticism when Java can be promoting a local chef or a cool new local jewelry designer.  When it's run by a local, written by locals, and put together in the publisher's dining room, I can't think of any magazine with MORE credibiilty and freedom.  The publisher and writers are meticulous in choosing to write about what moves them rather than what the latest hype is.  That's why you read a story about the man who purchased a building and was designing it into a venue before it was the Crescent Ballroom.  That's also why you'll read the backstory on five locally owned, little-known coffee houses at far ends of the valley.  The candid shots in the back are a tribute to local events the publisher attended but maybe an article hasn't been written about, or to local artists, designers or patrons of the arts.  While it's always interesting to hear what people think of Java, knowing what really goes on behind the scenes gives me nothing but respect for the handful of folks to who put their blood sweat and tears into creating this free publication each month.~~#~1
This place was AMAZING!  I have stayed in probably over 100 hotels, this one was the BEST hotel I have ever been to... staff was extremely friendly, I WILL be back!~~#~1
Overcrowded, sprawling mess of a mall (and I normally like malls). Traffic and parking are almost as bad as at Tempe Marketplace. The confusing layout makes it hard to find specific stores (even with the help of the directories).~~#~0
Finally had a chance to watch a game here! Just moved to Surprise in July, and have been waiting for spring training. Very easy parking, and the seats are great! It does not matter where you sit. The diner have great food. I will be coming here a lot!~~#~1
Amanda was very helpful when we looking at the ferrits.....   A great pet store.~~#~1
The bill was 150.00 and that was after a free appetizer coupon they sent me via email.  The food was no where near worth the HIGH price!  The service was not up to par either.  I really can't believe people pay such high prices for food that come with NO sides, etc.  I got iced tea to drink and it cost a whopping $6.00.  That's right folks....6.00 for a glass of tea.  What is that 100% profit/mark up?  I paid 12.00 for a soup sampler.  Each of the three soups were in a tiny espresso cup.  My salmon was no better than what I get at Texas roadhouse but it was three times the price.  I would definitely not recommended this place.  If you want a fancy, awesome meal go to Houston's!  The one thing that was great were the rolls (they were free too)!  Don't get me wrong the food is good but not worth the price tag!  You can get just as good food a lot of other places for a lot cheaper!~~#~0
Well thought-through details make Lux amazeballs. The espresso is good. Really good. Like, I need to order an espresso along with whatever else I'm ordering just because it is so delicious. The food is beautifully presented (little light on the gluten free snacks, but there's fruit, so no one is starving). There's plugs all over.The furniture is mostly easy to wipe down.The bathroom door has written out instructions so no one is confused on when the door is locked. It also has nice smelling soap. The patio is really pretty.The clientele seems ridiculously cool. I kind of feel like maybe I'm going to be cooler by association if I hang out here. I'M GIVING IT A GO. Let me know how I'm doing.~~#~1
The best Burgers in Town!!!!!  I have been hooked on their yummy burgers since the first bite.  I used to always drive by this place and notice that the parking lot was always packed........and no wonder, they are Wonderful!!!!!  Their custards are extremely yummy too :)  Worth the drive from North Scottsdale.  I haven't tried anything else off their menu besides the burgers, custard and fries.  Always tell myself that I will next time but when the time comes I just can't pass up my favs :)~~#~1
AMC Esplanade is by far the most successful navigator of the new "Dinner and a Movie" blue ocean the theater industry is starting to penetrate (that's right, I just referenced Blue Ocean Strategy, get over it).  No, it's not an extremely enlightened idea. I've been sneaking Bacardi into theaters since 2003 so it's about time theaters realize they should probably attempt to turn a profit off of it, but AMC really upped the game by not only providing me the option of purchasing alcoholic beverages from THEM, but also upgraded chairs, and a ton of delicious food (Including the obligatory $4 box of candy which is hilarious sitting next to a $9 burger. Like "Don't mind this $9 full meal over here, we still stand firm that Gummi Bears are worth their weight in gold.")Yes, it's more expensive than a regular ticket. Almost double for the nice seats. But trust me, YOU WANT THOSE SEATS. You will regret not getting the $15 seats if you don't buy the $15 seats so just pony up the cash and delight in the fact that movie theaters are now almost as comfortable as watching a movie in your own home. This theater is so nice it even makes bad movies tolerable. I saw The Master here and probably would have stabbed myself in the eye with my embezzled Bacardi flask if I didn't have a comfy recliner and three glasses of wine to get me through it. I seriously won't go to a movie anywhere else and I guarantee you'll say the same once you go. FIVE STARS.~~#~1
One star for the most terrible service in recent memory.  Our server "DK" was outright rude and horrible, and outright ignored us when she wasn't making us uncomfortable.   As a former waitress of 14 years, I have the utmost respect, patience and tolerance for my former bretheren - but this woman needs to go.  BAD DK!  Otherwise, our Teppiniyaki (sp?) chef was wonderful, the food was delicious and fresh and a solid four stars.  I have been going to Kyoto since 1995 and it remains a fun and festive place with very reasonable prices.  Too bad it was ruined this time by DK!   DK needs a different job, more suited to her personallity, like euthanizing kittens or something.~~#~0
Entering the store is visually overwhelming. There were so many things take in, I thought I'd found my new grocery store. I wandered for a good 40 mins checking everything out.... After the ether wore I began to realize something. While the selection was wide, it look OLD. I raced to the fresh fish and noticed that even packed in ice their little fish eyeballs where cloudy and sunken into the sockets. I looked at the frozen section and found some fish that had a sell by date of 02/2010. There was other fish that was packed by the store  with no packed on or sell by dates. There was canned and boxed food past their expiration date. I checked out this place on the Maricopa County health department and they had their fare share of customer complaint driven inspections.~~#~0
I have no idea why I haven't dined or noshed during happy hour at this place more often, I've always had great service, great wine, and great food. There is no adequate excuse , but anyway, my third adventure here made me update my review to 5 stars because 5th and Wine has earned it.The wines by the glass range from $8 - $11 unless you come in before 6pm then they are only $5! Those prices alone should make you want to come here for drinks with friends. The servers have always been cool with offering samples if you can't make up your own mind between two wines despite the recommendation from the server and your friend saying "just pick one!". Due to this fact, I've always had a glass that I have enjoyed, which is usually a Zinfandel. I have now had the pleasure of experiencing all of their different types of bruschetta. My top two favorites are the Prosciutto, Mascarpone, Figs, and Tomato Jam which has a great combination of salty and sweet, and the Apples, Brie, and Fig Jam one which is on the sweeter side, but not overwhelming because the bread and the tart granny smith apple slices help balance out the flavor. The Chopped Salad is very light and refreshing option to accompany the brushcetta appetizer. 5th and Wine is also a restaurant so other food options are available, I have sampled the Chicken and Pesto Pasta which has a delicious cream sauce and their Mac & Cheese which is super rich with the two types of melted cheese, but both items are delicious.The atmosphere is great whether you are sitting inside or outside. The lighting is soft, giving more of an intimate feel, yet this place still remains simple and casual, which I love. The outside patio is great, it is a courtyard that offers peeks into store windows while remaining private from the traffic of Old Town. The times I have been here it has never been super crowded and I am able to just walk in and be seated right away. 5th and Wine still feels like a hidden gem and you must try it out!~~#~1
Haven't been to a Vietnamese restaurant since I left Colorado, almost three years ago. But for what it's worth, this is the best, most authentic Vietnamese cuisine I've had so far. =)~~#~1
Slow service, staff needs more training. There's like 4 managers and none of the know what they are doing, i don't think this place is going to make it. Sorry but you lost 4 very good patrons Saturday night because of your poor customer service~~#~0
Had a fabulous time here with my husband celebrating my birthday last weekend. We both got "The Farmer's Feast" and it was truly amazing. I was not expecting that we would each get unique dishes so that let us sample even more of the food (though the hubby didn't really share too much). I highly recommend this option for anyone dining here. The antipasti was a great selection of cured meats and local cheeses. Next, I had a wonderful salad that was a great combination of sharp peppery flavors mixed with sweet. Strawberries, arugula, radishes, yum! For pasta course I got gnocchi with a rich and tasty cream sauce and my husband got ravioli stuffed with yam. His dish was amazing, I had to fight for a couple bites. For the fish course I had poached halibut that was served with some kind of really flavorful sauce and a vegetable puree so that whole thing was extremely delicious. The hubby got a very lightly seared tuna fillet. I was very surprised that he enjoyed it so much since he is usually not a raw fish kind of guy. For our main course I got a pork tenderloin and the hubby got braised beef... just lucky we each got our favorite meats. Each came with other vegetables and starches on the plate so they would have been an ample meal in and of themselves. For dessert, I got a goat cheese cheesecake that was truly amazing. One of the best deserts I have ever eaten. Very rich but the pieces were small enough so that it was not heavy. The dessert did not have too much sweetness so it went well with the ice wine it was served with which tasted like pure honey. Just fantastic. The hubby got bread pudding which we didn't much care for and it came with a sorbet that I didn't try. I got the wine pairings with the meal and every wine just complimented the dish it was served with so beautifully that I was really glad I added that option. Also, it ended up that you got a half glass (at least) with each course so I think it is a good value (the wine pairing was an extra $45.) I do agree with a couple of the reviewers who mentioned salt. There were a couple of dishes that had just a tad too much. However, I think that was not due to a mistake of the chef, I believe it is just because they use cured meats in a lot of their dishes. Another reviewer mentioned bad service but we did not experience that at all. Our server was extremely warm and friendly. She was very knowledgeable on the food and could answer any questions we had for her. She also took the time for each course to explain each dish and in my case the wine and why they went together. Only one time did my wine not come out at the same time with the food course and in that case our server apologized immediately. I do agree with some of the reviewers that the service is very slow... however, I believe that this is intentional. They have created a very cozy and comfortable environment and they want you to linger and enjoy yourself. With the Farmer's Feast in particular it took us almost 3 hours start to finish but I enjoyed every minute of it. It was nice to have time in between courses to sit and talk and relax. The spacing also kept us from feeling too full by the end (it is six courses after all!) or from letting the flavors from one dish influence the next. I was able to enjoy each course separately and independently with its own unique wine. It was pure food heaven. This is not the type of place where you would stop in for a meal before a show or event; when you come here, this should be your only destination for the night and it is such a great experience that it will be enough!  We truly had fantastic night here.One warning I will say is for ladies, you need to be prepared for the rural atmosphere and the walk from the car to the restaurant would be challenging in heels (I had been warned so had wedges). In fact the dress code overall was a bit more casual than I was expecting. Kai at Wildhorse Pass resort is my absolute favorite "special occasion" restaurant and so we were making a lot of comparisons between the two. My husband made the comment that when we were at Kai we spoke in library whispers the whole time and felt a little awkward at times (you know the type of place where you feel like if you use the wrong fork you may end up getting kicked out) but at Quiessence we were chatting away the whole time and completely at ease. It is definitely a much more comfortable and relaxed environment then any other I have experienced at a restaurant of this caliber.~~#~1
Good service and good food! I ordered the burger sliders for lunch without the 1000 island dressing and loved them! A quick little meal for those on the go! The attendant even offered me a nice tall glass of ice water to go while I was waiting.~~#~1
I've been a regular here the past 3 years. Other than the wait being long, the five spot sandwhich and waffle make this place one of my favorite in the nation.~~#~1
Barb at Tees and More does a great job.  They provided our company shirts and did a perfect job.  Fast service, great service and great people.~~#~1
Mid size American airport with very good organization, very straight forward, no hassle. Security is a little slow and priority lane isn't really priority, it's more of "let's make fun of first class flyers getting pissed" lane, so let's welcome first class flyers with big giggle!! Many stores and food quality is okay. Seating areas are limited, at least for the Terminal 3 before security, so be aware. Lots of volunteers working here to guide you to the right place, there may be more volunteers than passengers. Haha.~~#~1
I did not know I could still be creative since it had been years since I had done anything that involves even a minor level of creativity.But what fun was this!A girl friend took initiative here to organize a kitchen tea on a recent Saturday afternoon. We were a table of 6 girl friends that were scheduled for some pottery making! My initial idea of this venue was admittedly a little different but better than expected in so many ways!For one we did not have to get all that dirty. Not dirty at all really. Also not that I mind dirty. This is for those who wonder whether to go or not to go.And two - we were able to bring along our own food and drinks which made for excellent responsibility sharing in the wining and dining arena.Once we were set up with our party arrangements and have had some snacks and champagne we were inspired to start our artistic journey. The idea was to have each of the 6 friends make a dinner plate (or item of the bride to be's choice) which we will then give to her as a wedding present. I thought this idea was really original.So the bride to be selected her dinner plates of choice after which we were briefed by a very friendly and sweet staff member as to the different effects that the paint will have once the plates were baked. All informed we went to select the different colors we needed for our different art works.Everybody started painting and each one of us got really involved with their own creation. The event took us much longer than we anticipated but in such a good way. We finished about 4 hours after starting off but much enlightened by the activity.Everybody agreed that we will have to go here again for the sheer enjoyment and good feeling of togetherness it promoted. I have not yet seen the end product as one of our friends went to pick up our designs - but we will presenting our collective gift to the bride to be soon :)Go go here for a stimulating outing with good friends/family/kids!~~#~1
Stingray Sushi is where we go for sushi .Sleek ,beautiful interior and very ,very clean ! This dining house has large 13 or so foot doors that when open ,seamlessly link the patio potion with the interior dining area ,a very good design flow,indeed. The patio itself is very comfortable as it has great seating .The service has always been wonderful ,the sushi very fresh with beautiful presentation .We like to get the sushi boat , edamame ,and beef yakitori.The fire dragon rolls( though on the small side) are also yummy.Drinks are very good here ..the sinful orchid (yum)a very pretty drink .And their HH is really good as well .~~#~1
Waffle House was packed, Over heard another couple taking about "Fast Eddies", With a 20 min wait ahead of us we decided to try it out. Walked in looked like a senior center. Tables and chairs were very out dated. We sat down in a booth. Food was still on the table and the cushions were dirty. Waitress came over after 10 min and asked what we wanted to drink. 10 min later she brought out or coffee. Placed the order waited another 20 min to get the food. The diner wasn't busy at all. I don't know why the wait was so long. The food was ok, service was horrible. One thing that really grossed me out was the a/c return next to the office door. Look up and you will see probably years of dust that has collected. I showed the waitress and she really didn't care. I told her that if I would of saw that when I came in I would of just walked out. GROSS! Sorry Waffle House I will never betray you again.~~#~0
This place has the oiliest food I've ever eaten in my life.  I had carry out one evening (two dishes) and the entrees were soaked in oil.  I had to rinse with water my eggplant dish three times just to eat it without feeling sick to my stomach.  I wish I could've washed the other dish too (but it wasn't one that could be washed--it was a wide-rice noodle dish).Can definitely taste the MSG in these dishes too.Really not sure what the fuss is about.~~#~0
If it's an emergency, they will generally see you asap.  When we used to live in Desert Ridge, we had 2 dogs, 2 cats, there were times when I needed a vet immediately, and generally they will accommodate you in such a demise.  They see you pretty efficiently, but of course they will suggest things that I feel are not merited to add onto a bill, but it's your right to question their additions and refuse, of course.  I've never found them to be arrogant or pushy, they will easily offer other options, or be ok with your decision.During 1 extremely difficult period with our beloved Rottie/Sheppard Mix, they were very understanding to the emotional distress we were experiencing with regards to his advancing old age - he was 17.  They were happy to provided us with care during his aging.  Sadly, it came to a point that his quality of life was no longer conducive to allowing him to continue in the state he was, and it when it came to making the horrible and very sad decision to allow them to put him down, the entire staff were so understanding, caring, and totally sympathetic to our demise.  They allowed us to hold him, cradle him and pet him the whole time.  We were allowed as much time as we wanted before, during and after the whole life-altering circumstance.  They even sent us a sympathy card, signed by all the staff, after the terrible ordeal we went through.During another trying experience we had to endure, our boxer mix was attacked by another dog and needed emergency care.  We were now closer, and under the care of the Tatum/Shea location, but they were unable to see us.  This location was able to open up their schedule to see us under this distressing circumstance.  They provided expert care and glad to say that he mended just fine, with no lasting ill-effects.~~#~1
I am not a connoisseur of cupcakes so I don't have a ton of references to use on this review. That being said, I'm not really a big fan of cupcakes either. This place is family owned and operated. There's a wife and husband who run the place and the wife's sister works there also, which I thought was great. It is in the strip mall towards the western end of the shopping center.I tried a variety of the flavors including the Reese With-a-spoon, and a chocolate, chocolate chip cupcake. Coworkers that I shared them with, who are cupcake aficionados, really enjoyed the lemon and red velvet versions. While slight pricey for a cupcake, (slightly north of $2 per cupcake) if you have a special occasion or just want a special treat these cupcakes are incredibly moist and delicious. They also do custom cakes and cake pops, though I can't speak to either of the latter two.~~#~1
So much food for so little money, and they have kids meals that the kids will actually eat.  If you do not like what they offer in the cafeteria you can get food downstairs like Pizza and hotdogs...what kid does not like Pizza or a hotdog?I had the meatballs and mashed potatoes and they were so good.  I wish there was something bad to say about eating in a furniture store cafeteria, but there really is not - it was great food, great service and fun for the kids (there is a play area with a TV that they can eat at too (so the parents can enjoy their food too)My wife had the herb chicken and it looked great too, and she said it was really tasty too.  She loved it.  The desserts were amazing too, and very filling --- SO MUCH FOOD for SO LITTLE THE MONEY!I wish it was not so far away from Queen Creek, or I would hit it up so much more often!~~#~1
Imagine for a minute that you're waiting in a really long line. No, it's not the line ride. You see a menu on the wall with your ordering options, but before you are anywhere near someone that could take your order, you're yelled at."Hey! What do you want?"Don't be afraid, but don't be surprised either. Keep your cool and order your dogs. Immediately start thinking about if you want fries or rings (onion rings) and be prepared for when you're called upon again. Then watch as your hot dog is mutilated in front of your eyes and what appears on your tray is what looks like a hot mess of decapitated food.Never fear though... because it is amazing. Well worth the wait and one of the best dogs you'll ever have. My favorites here are the white hot and the bratwurst. Whenever I know I'm going, I end up salivating like Pavlov's dog for hours.The booths are classic hot dog stand style and the pennants lined up along the top of the walls are fantastic to look at. One started a whole conversation and research one day about a basketball team we knew nothing about.~~#~1
My husband and I heard great reviews about this restaurant and we decided to give them a shot. One word can describe this place GROSS!!! The food sounded great but then you took a bite and ewww disappointment. The salsa was lame, the chips stale. There were only two good things about this place the soda and the waitress was nice. Other than that don't waste your money GO TO ABUELO'S...it may be on the west side but it never disappoints.~~#~0
We stopped here on a Thursday night on a raving referral and they we not exaggerating - this place is fantastic!We are always a little hesitant to try a new place when an omnivore suggests it, but as vegetarians, we found Sekong by Night so accommodating! They offered to convert nearly any dish on their menu into a vegan alternative, and it was delicious. The spring rolls are really big, and they swapped their fish dipping sauce for a vegan version. We had the Phnom Penh Noodle Soup with tofu & veggie broth (just like the Vietnamese pho!) and the Katheaw Cha rice noodles with tofu instead of beef - AMAZING. Service was top notch, and as many other reviewers noted their prices are unbelievably low for the quantity and quality of food that you get.Looking forward to our next visit and trying more fantastic dishes!~~#~1
C'mon! Fresh sandwich lunch for $3? The place makes it to order, incredible variety of baguette style sandwiches. Cash only, but the have an ATM in the lobby with a low fee. Or is it no fee? Anyway, great coffee and drinks and teas. Line moves super fast. Number pickup system is funky. My family packs these things to take home on the plane!~~#~1
I'm fairly new to the whole Costco experience. Now that we've bought a house it's time to buckle down and buy in bulk! As as new user I'd thought it would be helpful to post the following neat services Costco has to offer:1. Great deals on contact lenses. Before I would buy my contacts from justlenses.com but through Costco I bought 8 boxes (a year's supply) and received $50 off! $25 off via instant rebate at the cashier and another $25 off via mail-in rebate which came in less than a month after the order.2. PIZZA AND HOT DOGS. The take out pizza is huge and only 9.99 and the hot dog and coke pair is only 1.50. These make for a delicious and quick lunch. They also have smoothies and salads if you're looking for something on the "lighter" side.3. Food expos come and go often. Recently I got a deal on a 10 pack of pita bread, a huge container of hummus and pita chips for 12 bucks. The company was from California and let customers try as many samples as they pleased.  It was well worth the money and super fresh!4. And here's where I feel Costco has really benefited me. My fiance and I booked our honeymoon to Tahiti through Costo Travel! I'm big on comparing prices before making a big purchase and Costco was hands down the best price. It included seven nights, hotel and round-trip airfare all for one great deal. The customer service agent I spoke with was friendly and more than willing to answer my 500 questions about travel. I would recommend Costco Travel to anybody looking for reliable customer service and excellent travel/airfare packages.~~#~1
PHENOMENAL place for Chinese cuisine. The portions are HUGE! My fiance and I always only order one thing and share it, and still always have leftovers. The menu prices are very reasonable. Including tip, we usually don't spend more than $15 for the both of us for dinner. They are very personable and attentive to your needs. I love that it is a very dainty, and has a very laid back atmosphere. The lemon chicken is our favorite!! :) They are also very kid friendly. We have an 18 month old son who always leaves a nice pile of rice on the floor every time we leave lol, but they love him! Highly recommend!~~#~1
girlfriend and i always stop here on our treks to lee lee market.  If you haven't tried pho (pronounced fuh) , this is a great spot.  Basically its a beef soup thats a thousand times tastier than campbells.  its served with a plate of crisp and fresh veggies, like bean sprouts, jalapenos, basil, etc,  that you can throw in the soup.   i recommend using the spicy sauce that has roasted garlic in it instead of sriacha.   we also had the lemongrass beef salad which was equally good.  Everything is fresh and tasty with great service.  make sure you take dobson for the easiest entrance as pho ao sen is facing west!~~#~1
Nice facilities, nice AC, but two FATAL flaws:1. Children running around yelling and screaming at all times.  This is a failure of the parents and, more importantly, of the staff who apparently REFUSE to enforce any kind of policies against noise whatsover.To parents and staff: THIS IS A LIBRARY *NOT* A DAYCARE!!!!!2.  The "collection" here is 90% DVDs and "Dummies" books with trashy novels thrown in for good measure.~~#~0
I was hoping to be the first to review Grayhawk Family Chiropractic, but I'm glad to see Heather feels the same way I do about them.Dr. Frank Sorrentino is a true professional. I've suffered from low back issues for years and Dr. Frank always knows how to treat the problem. Between regular visits and the website they set you up with to demonstrate stretches tailored to your condition I'm glad to report I've been in good shape for a while.Whether you have an ongoing issue or have just injured yourself Grayhawk Family Chiropractic is the place to go.~~#~1
This cafe provided me with my first Ethiopian cuisine experience. It was delicious and I am eager to go back. The most impressive thing to me was their selection of vegetarian dishes. They had as many options as those with meat which I really appreciate (doesn't happen very often.) The service was great. You can tell this is a family run restaurant that cares about their patrons. The food is very reasonably priced which make it easy to try a variety of dishes. We started with the shorba which is a lentil based soup. This was probably my favorite part of the meal, it was absolutely delicious---satisfying and hearty. We also had the vegetable combination which had 5 different dishes served on the injera, a crepe-like bread you eat the main dishes with.This is a fun way to eat (with your hands) and opened up a new world of foods for us! Can't wait to go back and devour a bowl of shorba.~~#~1
This is hands down the best place for bagels...but more importantly... after all my travels it has the BEST Bialy ever.I just wish they would open on in Greenville.Oh it is soooo good, a poppy seed bialy toasted with cream cheese...I guess I can only hope they are always open when I visit Scottsdale....n~~#~1
The wash ain't bad....but the process to get it done is pathetic.  The ticket writers at the entrance move in slow motion. They try to upsell at every opportunity.  Four cars backed up waiting to order their service...and the crew is standing around with no cars going thru.I'd rather drive my car dirty then endure the agony of incompetent management.~~#~0
I am very happy to say that Angela's truffles are taking off here in Cottonwood. I hope I am allowed to say I am a proud purveyor. When they arrived I was impressed by their design and further blown away by the flavor. (Tears in my eyes...) My darling, have no fear, there are people up here who understand flavor, quality and most importantly: Great Chocolate! My beautiful patrons have latched onto these delectable wonders and I am happy to say The Cocoa Palette will always have a place in Northern AZ Wine Country with Bonne Lait! Bravo mon ami!~~#~1
I guess this is an east coast/midwest thing because I really don't get it. I'm not a picky eater and I HATE wasting food and money, but I could not finish my plate. I ordered french toast and I was not aware that my french toast was going to be deep fried. Seriously, when I put my fork through it, a piece of fried toast hit me in the eye. My husband was also not impressed with his food. If someone would like to suggest something delicious on the menu that I should try, please let me know because I currently want to vomit every time I see a Chompie's.~~#~0
I had a mani/pedi and they did a wonderful job every time I visit.. The place is clean and the specialists are very nice..~~#~1
Shocked this place has 4 stars. First off you can always tell if a Mexican food place is good based on the beans and the salsa. Well guess what both suck! Eat at el molino's and you will never come here again!~~#~0
Well, it's fresh, and it's easy.  Perfect words to describe this cute, clean little store!  This was my fave F&E in Phoenix because it was a mere block and a half from my place.  I STILL miss it, and I moved away from Phx over a year ago!  I popped in here several times a week to pick up staples, (it was always an adventure to see which prices had been marked down-- they even have a section in cold foods where they mark older stuff way down).  I appreciated their little bundles of veggies which were sold in just-right amounts (as in, not so much that some of it will end up going bad). This market was also great for soups (their brand was my pick, although they have a selection of major brands as well); it was also my go-to place for prepared healthful lunches perfect for work (like the F&E pre-made burritos and pasta dishes).  Check out frozen foods too-- there are reasonably priced items like tempura, and special organic seafood dishes I never found anywhere else.  I also liked the casual setup of the checkout area, with the option for a cashier or self-serve.  And...wait for it... I just found out they are opening at least two F&Es in Sacramento!!!  (okay, that won't likely cause much of a stir with the Phoenix crowd, but I am so excited they'll be open in my area!)~~#~1
sslowest drive through ever!!!~~#~0
The food really is exceptional. Its like the chefs create these perfect little bites, and they literally are bites, of food that are so interesting to taste.I'd recommend the sampler dinner. I want to say it runs about $40- $50 but its worth it as long as you like what's included.IT IS EXPEN$IVE. BUT the BF and I have been dying to try out this restaurant due to all the rave reviews it has been receiving on Yelp. LUCKILY a Groupon appeared for NOCA and we jumped on the opportunity. Turned out the fab deal was only marginally helpful. Even with the Groupon it was still a $150 dinner (plus the cost of the groupon...).  Granted we did get a bottle wine (but the cheapest we could find), espresso and a french press cafe... It's like you analyze how much everything costs as you're ordering and are still shocked when the bill comes- I hate that.Our reservation wasn't until 8:30pm at night, no big deal. The restaurant was still PACKED! AND people kept coming through the door!It is not a large venue. And the tables are CRAMMED, uber close together. I know that the four-some sitting next to us are going to Isreal next month, right after their family vacation to Minnesota....~~#~1
This is my favorite public pool in the entire valley.  It's super cheap - 2.25 for adults, 1.00 for kids.  You can bring in drinks and snacks as long as they are not in a cooler (weird).  They have a snack bar. It's very clean.  Oh and the most important part, they have a lazy river, two big water slides, a whirlpool, toddler play area with more slides, basketball, lap pool, diving boards.... I think that's it.  It's quite a drive but it's worth it.~~#~1
Just came from there as part of my trip down the Apache Trail. My 9year old daughter loved it so much she insisted on stopping in again on the way back. The town is really cute with tons of photo ops. We picked up a few fun souveniers and some prickly pear fudge. We did this in 100 degree temps and still enjoyed it. For those curmudgeons moaning about this being a tourist trap, RELAX....the kids love it. This 40 something mom loved it. It's free to just walk around.  But definitely do the Mystery Shack. Weird and fun. I actually got dizzy in it.~~#~1
This place confirms why "hole in the wall" places are the best places to get food. Its virtually impossible to find the place but once you smell the aroma of home-cooked Mexican food, you know that you're there. Usually there is a long line; however, their service is quick. With the combination of their swift service and decadently savory food, Rito's is a staple Mexican food stand that everyone has to visit when in Phoenix. I always have a green chilli burrito and haven't quite ventured out to other things on their menu, but I have never heard anything less than positive about what they have to offer.~~#~1
I am furious.In the last 12 months, I have had at least scheduling issues, from them calling me at 8AM on a Saturday morning (my 1 day off) to cancel my 11am appointment to last Saturday, when I went in only to be told someone had messed up, and actually booked me for the NEXT week, and despite me driving all the way out there at 11am, they couldn't get me in until maybe that evening, and then not with someone who had experience in deep tissue/medical massage. I was irritate and ready to ask for my membership refunded then, but Ashley the clinic manager promised me that they'd give me my next week appointment free of charge, and that she'd personally be certain there were no more issues.  As I literally couldn't turn my head to the left due to pain, I took her up on that. BIG MISTAKE.Yesterday (the Friday before my "correctly" scheduled massage, I went out of my way to call in and confirm my own bloody appointment, to try and avoid last week's debacle. According to the woman who answered the phone, it looked like my schedule therapist was actually scheduled off, but she went to talk with her manager, and came back to the phone telling me everything was ok, and that she'd call with any issues. Then yesterday evening, I got ANOTHER confirmation call from Massage Envy, confirming and reminding me of my 11:30am appt on Saturday with my preferred therapist. GIven that I've had 3 migraines this week (versus my 0 or 1 when I get a massage the weekend prior), I really absolutely needed to get in, so I felt more confident.Well, I was just woken up at 8am...again. On my day off...again. To explain to me that, big shock, they messed up my scheduling again, and that apparently, my therapist was off today. Despite Ashley's promise of it not happening again. Despite me being pro-active and calling to confirm. I am sitting here in pain, so furious at this repeated treatment that I can't even go back to bed...and the best part? They don't even have a manager on duty I can complain to.My treatment at the hands of the booking/front desk staff has been any thing BUT relaxing. I continue to walk out of there frustrated, angry, and occasionally in tears. I know they say Fool Me Once, Shame On You, Fool Me Twice, Shame On Me, but I was trying to give them the benefit of the doubt. I'm pretty screwed for today and the next week, but luckily, an Elements place with a similar concept opened recently in the general area. At this point, it literally cannot be any worse than massage envy. As much as I love Talisha and Aisha as massage therapists, getting a massage should feel good, and not like you're just a number to them, not like you actually have to spend more time trying to get a damn appointment than you actually get to spend IN the appointment.~~#~0
I was very excited to find this place as you will be when you walk inside and find nice clothes and accessories for even nicer prices!  There are several locations throughout the (east) valley.  Treat yourself.  You will be happy you did.~~#~1
Decided to give Tempe Marketplace another try after reading recent reviews (hoping that they had improved). I had to ask myself if we were visiting the same place. The traffic and parking situation are still horrible and the loudspeakers in the parking lot are unacceptable. The JC Pennys and Targets are crippled versions of their regular stores at other malls. The stores here all open too late (11am, REALLY???) to be useful in our uber hot summers (except for a Targets that opens at 8am). Even though I am a Tempe resident, I will continue to choose the Riverview shopping area on Dobson over this mish-mashed monstrosity.~~#~0
This location opened up just 3 weeks ago, and offers high quality, natural products for mainly cats and dogs, although there is a very basic small animal section.  The emphasis is on foods that are more nutritious, healthier, and that don't have corn or soy in them. There is a large freezer section in the back with a good selection of raw food meals.  Also, there is a plethora of treats and toys for your furry friend as well.  The small animal foods section has a few small bags of hay, some treats, pellets, and toys.  I wasn't too impressed with their rabbit selection, and they did not offer high quality brands such as Oxbow which is a bit surprising since they have so many high quality dog and cat products.Jill, the manager, was very enthusiastic and is very passionate about providing the best products for pets.  She showed me various treats, foods, and toys, and provided a lot of educational material on dog nutrition and health.  She provided a free sample of some nice grain-free dry dog kibble which is highly recommended on dogfoodadvisor.com, which I appreciated a lot since my dog is a bit picky with the food he eats.  This is definitely a place to go to spoil and pamper your dog or cat!~~#~1
This is the best ice cream I've ever had, bar none!  I had the salted caramel, and it was wonderful!  I felt like I was 7 years old and enjoying my first ever ice cream cone.  I also love the decor of the shop, the braille on the back wall is so cool (although I do wonder exactly what it says!)  I also bought a pint of their ice cream at Whole Foods, I love Sweet Republic and everything it stands for!  Totally recommended!~~#~1
This 5 star rating is mostly for their boba! They are cool about how many flavors I put into my boba (usually about 4!) unlike other boba shops that only allow like 2Their ramen is pretty good and decently priced. However, I don't like coming to this place much ONLY because I don't like coming out smelling like an Asian restaurant.~~#~1
I really love this place. I'm not sure why there are so many mixed reviews... maybe what they ordered? I always get the regular size custom burger... blue cheese, mayo, lettuce, tomato (and sometimes bacon). Simple and delicious. The rosemary fries with Smash sauce are also amazing. The only thing I didn't care for were the fried pickles... a bit too salty.~~#~1
My husband and I LOVE El Metate... we joke about putting a line item in our budget for this place we eat there so much. Their food is delicious, they are family owned and operated - always friendly. Their hot sauce is to die for, both green and red. It's possible I like El Metate better than Amados!~~#~1
One hour. That is how long we waited after ordering before we decided we would rather eat anywhere that wasn't here. A crushing, impressively underwhelming experience in lack of service.We arrived, found we had free valet parking? With a teensy parking lot, this works, thank you. A good selection of indoor and outdoor seating? Also a plus. Setting expectations and/or taking care of waiting customers? FAIL.On a beautiful AZ autumn morning we came here (tho we entered Rockerij). We asked to be re-seated outside because inside of Rockerij is dark as a tomb and had loud, conversation intruding, music. We were reseated by the fireplace, and a waiter came over shortly to take our order. Bam. So far so good...or so we thought. 30 Mins after placing our order, I ask another waiter to check on the status of our food and he cleverly asks about what we ordered (exactly)...so we think it is being taken care of. 40 MINS after placing our order, I have still only had my coffee refilled once...and had to flag down another waiter to inquire about the status of our food again, because our actual waiter is nowhere to be found and the previous "drive-by" waiter never returned. A few mins beyond that, this guy actually comes back and indicates that our order is nearly ready and should only be a few minutes longer. Shortly thereafter OUR waiter stops by with comments of: "I don't know why it's taking so long..."and"I put the ticket in right after I took your order..."So...as a waiter...maybe it might be part of your job to check on the status of an order say...15mins after bringing it by the kitchen? Perchance? What do you think?FIFTEEN (15 == few?) minutes later, we still had no food and I'd had quite enough. Out the door we went.On a comical note: As we were outside (another 5 minute wait because the valet had our car either parked in Egypt somewhere or tandem?) our waiter came out to find us to let us know that our food was ready if we'd like to come back inside?Oh R E A L L Y? The Clue-Delivery Train will be visiting you shortly. Facial cues you may want to look for in the future are:1) the furrowed eyebrows2) fuck-you facial expressionand3) curling fistsIt seems that we are not alone in this. Courtney W.'s review (10/14/12) is representative of what we experienced.I am dumbfounded how they have any good reviews. There must be a serious drought of sit down restaurants in this part of town, because this crap would never fly where I live. I cannot tell you how much I am looking forward to NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN.P.S. They own 3 restaurants apparently: Richardson's, Rokerij, and Dick's Hideaway...all right in the same area (Rokerij and Richardson's being attached). P.P.S. They all serve the same menu. It is NOT amazing. I have previously been to Dick's. Yes, it is good. No my socks did not come flying off.P.P.P.S. ProTip: Drive down to Central Phoenix and go to Durant's, Portland's, Switch, or Fez. All of these places have exemplary service and food to match.~~#~0
Love the shows the promoters bring in. Cozy spot where I've seen Owl City, A Fine Frenzy, Landon Pigg and more. Plus they are generous with the Malibu Rum :) You will need to visit the bar to get your own as I've never really seen cocktail servers. Oh well... Atmosphere is laid back, chill. A large patio. And yes, the Shaker Room. The hot, shake your stripper ass, place to be.~~#~1
I really love the chicken and how it already comes with pickles o. The sandwich ... Fave.. I also love the buffalo sauce very addicting~~#~1
This place is great!~~#~1
We traveled from Anthem to find this little Turkish heaven.  The drive was worth it. Loved everything about this place from the service to the food! Definitely be back.~~#~1
This place is great! I really appreciate the extreme friendliness and kindness of the employees. Best customer service. Also, the variety of favors is fantastic!~~#~1
Wow these cupcakes were amazing!! The frosting was picture-perfect. I tried Vanilla Salted Caramel and Pumpkin and both were so good! The cake on both were super dense and moist. Vanilla Salted Caramel definitely was the best of the two!~~#~1
I am 5'0", so I require a lot of alterations and it is essential that I have a good alteration service.  I will never go anywhere other than Elegant Reflections for my tailoring services.  I have had innumerable pairs of pants hemmed here and have been completely satisfied.  They have nice private dressing rooms with real doors (I refuse to undress behind nothing more than a curtain), everyone on staff is competent and very friendly, the prices are reasonable, and they are almost always able to complete your alterations in less than a week.I have only ever encountered one issue..when I had two pair of very thick trousers hemmed with a cuff at the bottom, the cuff seemed loose.  Since I didn't want it to get caught on something and come apart, I took them back to be adjusted.  The second alteration was done in just a couple days (in winter, which tends to be a busy busy time for them) and the new stitching was nearly indestructible!The staff here also seems to have an exceptional memory, because even after a year hiatus- they greeted me by name!~~#~1
I'm going to be an uptight stickler here, and only review the pizzeria portion of LGO since the grocery part can be done under as a separate business. I hope others follow suit. Sorry, I'm super nerdy about this stuff.Anyways, the sourdough crust is my favorite pizza crust in all the land. I love the flavor and how it's always glistening with oil when it comes to the table. The toppings are really special here. If you even remotely like avocado, get their avocado pizza. The lemon zest puts it over the top. The corn with goat cheese is my next favorite. The only one that I haven't liked is the the rocket man. It tasted fine, but the heavy toppings were too much for the thin crust.We also had the fortune of trying their grilled artichoke appetizer one evening. I couldn't get enough of it! It's not on the menu (seasonal item I'm sure), but we asked about it when we saw plates of it go by.Extra bonus points for the large selection of cheap pizza wines. Any time I can get a decent bottle at a restaurant for under $20, I'm a happy camper.~~#~1
Cartel is my go to coffee place.  If I could drink here everyday, I would.  The barista who seems to always be working sunday mornings makes the best lattes that I've ever had, ever.  Each one always has a cute little heart or leaf shaped on the top which obviously is their secret as to why they're so delicious.  I've never gotten anything else because I've already discovered the best.  If you're cool, you probably like to hang out here on the reg.    I definitely recommend, best coffee in Tempe by far. It's a little hard to find if you've never been before, right off university on ash across from the circle k.~~#~1
As I promised myself, I'd go back again to try it again. Yyyeeaahhhh...sooooo....the food is still not good. I got the mongolian beef and it's like "wha? really? is this IRL?" I'm a chinese food kind of a fan, this restaurant, I'm not a fan of.~~#~0
If you are staying in Phoenix for any length of time, this is a must stop for at least a cocktail.  From walking through the kitchen, to being seated promptly in a booth, this is quintessential gastronomic delight.  Durant's is an icon and legend. Period.  Wine list is great, have a well-versed sommelier also.  I never order Filet, but when in Rome...~~#~1
Yeah, yeah, I know there are already like fifty-something reviews for this place, most of them four or five stars, I don't care. Here's one more, another twig on the bonfire celebrating Richardson's awesomeness...The food's the same awesome New Mexican cuisine as Dick's Hideway around the corner, but eating here is a totally different experience. The dark pueblo interior with Native American rugs surrounding the high-backed booths provides a great deal of privacy for you and your party. I recommend any and all of the seafood dishes - my favorites include the shrimp quesadilla and the scallops... OMG the scallops, so good when I think about 'em they make me lose control and type text message shorthand like "OMG". Of course my friends constantly remind me that as much as I love the food here, I can't truly appreciate it because I don't eat the meat dishes, which, according to them, are even better. And they're probably right. They usually are.Went with a group of 6 last week, which seems to be about as large as the booths at Richardson's can handle (for much larger groups there's a private room available at Dick's). Service was super friendly and extremely efficient. Yeah, it can be a little pricy depending on what you order, but in my opinion, totally worth it. Sometimes you gotta splurge.~~#~1
I LOVE White Lion Tea. The company uses great quality of everything!!!My favorites are Tuscany, Ginger Peach, Green Passion Tea, White Ambrosia Tea as far as I have tried :) Everytime I opened a tea bag, I have to take a good deep inhale from a tea bag. It's smell soooo great as the tea taste.Thank you White Lion for having such awesome products !!!~~#~1
The new Kale salad is to die for! I love this place! Every time we have lunch here it is busy but somehow the staff always finds us a seat! The food is always really good and the speed in which you get it is amazing. This is the best lunch place in the valley!~~#~1
The slices of pizza are cheap, huge, and very very good.  I really don't have to say anymore.~~#~1
Nice looking place with average food and horrible service.  Everything took forever and no one came by to see how we were doing.  We literally watched our server going around setting tables and taking napkins off of empty tables rather than making himself available to us.  He wandered around from table to table in a completely unoccupied area of the restaurant the majority of the time we were there.  The food was luke-warm and nothing special.  I was only here once so I hate to be so down on the place, but based on the other reviews my experience sounds pretty typical.  Don't waste your money.~~#~0
I'd love to give this place MORE than 5 stars!!!In Phoenix a few weeks ago I needed to planb a nice dinner for a group of 10.  I thought about a few places and wanted to come here because of the view.  (Get it? Different Point of View.....?) Anyway, while I did initially pick DPOV because of the view, I fell in love with the perfect service AND the perfect menu.There were great options for my picky group, and not one person left unhappy, or hungry.  In addition, they seem to have a pre-fix menu with a nice price tag if you're ballin on a budget.  Everything was AMAZING and it's definitely one of my favorite restaurants in DC!~~#~1
Great multigrain sandwiches. Nice patio too!~~#~1
Where to start???The owners are very kind... say hi to Benny in the kitchen!!!My wife and I found this place while living in the culinary-void NW Valley of Phoenix, and we have eaten here probably 50 times over a 3-year period.  Everything is good:GryosChicken PitaSouvlakiGreek Salads are probably one of the best salads that we have ever eatenFries are always freshZatsiki sauce is stellarThe atmosphere is a bit void, but people don't come to 35th and Thunderbird for the atmosphere...  they come for great food at a great price.~~#~1
This is a cool dive away from all the Old Town BS. The jukebox is one of the best I have heard in some time. They were playing songs I never heard of so I know I'm going to be in trouble in the future by using Shazam to identify songs and then buying them from my phone!Anyway, just be sure you eat before you get there as this is all about hanging in a dive and having drinks. They have lots of beer and the bartenders are cool. If I lived closer I would hang out here much more......~~#~1
little known secret- the golf course bar!!!!  amazing margaritas and a super-cheap happy hour.  didn't mind watching the cute guys checking in after a long day of golfing, either!  my bff and i were so happy to have stopped here after our day at the spa.~~#~1
We recently took a weekend getaway to Phoenix and stayed here. The Hotel is beautiful and our rooms were spacious and very comfortable. The staff here are topnotch. I love the lobby wine & hot apple cider hour in the afternoons, and the lobby coffee & hot chocolate bars in the mornings. We had access to the Golds Gym across from the hotel and were able to get a good workout in their cardio theatre. There is an outdoor skating rink right outside and a small shopping/dining area. It is located right across from the stadium and could walk to our event. I would definitely recommend staying here, especially if you are attending an event at the arena.~~#~1
I can only add my gushing praise to the other reviews.  Not only is the food outstanding (pork osso bucco, green chile stew and pecan/fig pie), but the ambiance and service really help make this place a standout.  So many places have arrogant, stuffy service, so Scottsdale.  Not so here.  Also, the waitstaff had opinions about the food - which dishes are his favorite and why.  Elegant but comfortable atmosphere, reasonable prices, and a real enthusiasm from the staff (and a chef, who came to visit with folks that he knew who were sitting near us).  The food is rich, but did not seem unhealthily so - not bathed in salt and heavy cream sauce.  Perfect portion size, with a balance - meat, grains and veggies.  So happy that Beckett's is in the neighborhood!(Oh - and no valet!  I  hate valet parking when there is an ample adjacent parking lot, and spots are only limited because the valets put their cones in the available spots.)~~#~1
I had lunch there recently and was very impressed with the food,  friendly service and excellent value.  I had a lunch special -- two cheeseburger sliders with sweet potato fries.  They serve the burgers with several pieces of fresh crisp lettuce, tomato and onion.  We will definitely go there again.~~#~1
One of my fav sushi places in the Valley.  Great place to take someone who has never tried sushi or still is unsure of what they like.  Great place to take someone who loves sushi but is indecisive.  Some of my favorites include the spicy shrimp/crab roll, Phoenix roll, and their squid salad.  Plus - you can't beat the Vegas roll - $1.50 for 3 pieces? It's a steal!  Definitely one of the more fun sushi places in the Valley!~~#~1
I'm pretty sure that Palee's Crown is the best Thai place I have ever been to. The service is always great, and the Owner comes out to talk to us whenever we are there.The food is so amazing, I have never tried something that I disliked at all. I especially love the Pad Thai and the Currys. I am always full and completely satisfied by the time I leave. I also recommend trying the Thai Iced Tea to drink if you are like me and enjoy weird authentic drinks, and for dessert be sure to get the coconut ice cream. Don't make excuses about trying to spend less money or that you are being careful about what you're eating, just try it.The prices are good and if you're not sure what to try, stick with a curry but remember that Asian spices are very distinct, and very spicy.~~#~1
We found Ippei happhazardly through United Airline's dining points program and were instantly hooked.  We now frequent the place at least once or twice a week.A great atmosphere with a very warm and welcoming host, Michael.  It has all of the ambiance of a very chic place, without the attitude and pompous feel.  The wait staff are all very attentive and pleasant.  The drinks are creative.  And if you're lucky, the owner may join you in a sake bomb, though he insists this is not authentic Japanese tradition.I'm not a huge sushi person and was mainly brought along by my friends, so I can't comment on all the finer touches on the sushi and whatnot.  I can say, however, that if you ask really nicely you may be able to try a roll that the chefs are working on that is not yet on the menu, including a rib-eye roll that is absolutely delicious and friendly to those of us that shy away from sushi because of the whole raw fish deal.Prices are very reasonable.  This is an up-and-coming spot that is still fairly quiet, but not for long.  Come now before you have to worry about getting a reservation a week ahead of time.  As it is now, you can just walk in.Great place to bring a date - low lighting, great service, great food, lots of fun.~~#~1
Very clean with and old fashion cinema atmosphere. Snacks are very expensive so if popcorn and soda are a must for you, expect to spend alot of money. The amazing reclining seats are worth it though. I definitly recomend Cinemark 16 as the place to go to watch movies!    Also there are alot of great eating places next to it or within walking distance to do the dinner  and movie date night!~~#~1
This is one of our favorite pizza places - for the food, value, drinks and great atmosphere! I originally discovered them at the Scottsdale Culinary Festival, and am so happy I did!It is in a great location, walking distance to a bunch of fun bars so it's a great place to start the night in Old Town. My husband and I's favorite thing on the menu is the margarita pizza. The crust is so crisp and perfect! As for drinks, Jac's has a really fun cocktail menu, and also a good wine selection. Our favorite: the ONEHOPE Cabernet Sauvignon. Affordable, smooth, and pretty cool that half of the profits are donated to charity.Definitely check this place out, you'll love it!~~#~1
I saw the review below and just thought it was ridiculous. RIDICULOUS. Elderly people work here or volunteer. You expect customer service that you'd receive at a high-end store. No. People die and their things that are usually in good condition are donated and are resold at really cheap prices. No, the people there will not be making sure you're finding everything okay, you're on your own... and that's how it should be when you're thrifting.I usually find great things. Glasswares, books, shoes, purses. They have amazing furniture that is so cheap. They have many half off days and various sales throughout the week.Just make sure you go on a weekday or Saturday and before 2pm.. all the stores in this plaza close at 4 and are closed Sundays.~~#~1
Move over Maizie's you've been replaced...for brunch that is. I have a tradition with a lucky few of at least once a weekend going to Maizie's for their brunch and getting smashed. Oh, and we eat a little too.Everything changed this weekend though when we went to Postino on Central for their brunch debut. The food was so ridiculous good, that we actually forgot to drink. Did you hear me?? FORGOT TO DRINK!!Since it was our first time there, we ordered a variety of options. I had the Country Toast, which was toasted MJ Bread, topped with Italian Ham, Gruyere Cheese, and a sunny-side up egg. Ho-ly shit. Each bite became increasingly better than the last. It was the perfect bite over and over and over again. The ham had a nice little spice to it, the gruyere cheese had an intoxicating tang to it, the egg was, well, an egg, and the toast really brought it all together incredibly. And it was huge. I barely got through half if it before I had to give up.My brunch date got Postino's take on French Toast. To be honest, I am not huge on sweets first thing in the morning, however I would have bathed in this french toast. It was creamy, not overly sweet, and literally melted in my mouth.I ordered a White Peach Bellini at the beginning of our meal per norm and while it was spectacular with actual peach puree in the bottom of my champagne flute, I completely ignored it after the first bite of my meal. Me. Ignoring anything in a champagne flute. I know.I feel a bit like the blase housewife who just cheated on her husband for the first time with the pool boy, but I'm sorry Maizie's, consider me shacked up with said pool boy every weekend in the early hours from here on out!~~#~1
This place is home.~~#~1
These guys are great!I  Even though they specialize in Mercedes, they never have a problem with my BMW X5. The owner, Charles, knows what he is doing and never tries to up-sell you on unnecessary work.  Mary (Charles' wife) is a really sweet lady who always gives me a ride home and picks me up when the car is ready.  While Aurohaus doesn't have loaner cars like the dealership, they are extremely competent, trustworthy, and charge reasonable prices for their services.~~#~1
HORRIBLE service - did nothing to correct our experience.On July 7, 2011, my date  and I arrived around 6:30 pm, well dressed and ready to enjoy a celebratory dinner without any financial limitations. We would have easily spent $250+.Instead, after an hour of being seated  to review our menus we were never offered more than a cocktail.Tables around us were receiving quality attention by other servers...complete with the run down of the specials, house favorites, answering questions, etc. We, on the other hand, were lucky to have our make server look at us, much less take us to the next step our level in our dining experience.When the table behind us, seated a good 15 mins after us, received bread before we were, my date and I decided that was our tipping point and would not stay any longer.When our server came to ask if we were ready to order we informed him  we would not be staying for dinner  and would like the bill for the cocktail.Never once did the server apologize, offer what he could do to make things right, etc. Needless to say, we were stunned. The hostess thanked us for dining on our way out...again, we both gritted our teeth with frustration. However, later we discovered that after an hour of sitting in the dining room, we were there long enough to enjoy a meal. It's unfortunate we never got the opportunity to, however.What did go right was...we were promptly seated and the cocktail server provided decent service.~~#~0
wow. this place is a gem.  highly recommend it if you're looking for a great place to take a date or chill with some friends out in the patio over some wine. visited friends in the phoenix area over thanksgiving vacation and they took us here on a Saturday night.  i dont know much about the chandler area but this place could easily rival any of the popular wine lounges here in san diego.  as for food, our group ordered a bunch of the bruschettas, flatbreads and a couple sandwiches to share family style.  we all enjoyed all of it, i especially recommend the fig chutney, that was absolutely amazing.  from the sandwiches, the shrimp blt definitely stuck out as my favorite.  overall, everything was very good and the service was great. as for the wine, great selection. the staff was very helpful in helping us pick out the perfect bottle based on what we like. in fact, i think i found my new favorite wine thanks to them.  if you're a wino like me, you'll love this place.  as for the ambiance, they nailed it.  awesome patio and great decor.  the attention to detail is definitely noticeable. very chill spot. ps. check out the door to their wine cellar, i want that in my house. it's gorgeous.~~#~1
Yum! Healthy selections and delicious flavors!~~#~1
If I could only eat at one place for the rest of my life, it would have to be at FnB. This is ultimate comfort food for me - with the bulk of the menu highlighting local in-season organic vegetables from McClendon and other local farms. Charleen prepares dishes that pay the ultimate homage to the vegetable and the farmer with perfect seasoning, contrast, balance and temperatures. Beyond vegetables, the housemade burrata was light as a cloud and shrimp grilled to perfection on the mesquite. Dishes at FnB are simple but often the simplest dishes are the hardest to get right as there is nothing to hide behind - ingredients have to be fresh and of the highest quality and execution must be perfect. Charleen and her crew strike it out of the park almost every time.Service is professional, attentive and friendly. Pavle and his team make you feel right at home, which is the other reason why I would happily eat here everyday.~~#~1
They served us stale rice.  Average main dishes, not as flavorful.  Not enough meat in the lamb dishes.  Overpriced.~~#~0
Two weeks after I dropped off my computer for service with the Geek Squad I got it back with a new screen and hand rest.  They said 3 weeks and I got it in two!!!  And the open-box computer I purchased to use while mine was in the shop was returned with no problems. I was so happy we purchased a new Toshiba DVD player for $40. Who knew that DVD players could be so cheap?  I've been using it all day and it works beatifully.~~#~1
i'm not a vegan or a vegetarian, i thoroughly enjoy sinking my teeth into a thick juicy piece of medium-rare steak. and i love eggs in the morning and chicken tacos at 2am. i am also very hesistant to try anything the attempts to substitute for meat, because i think it's just psychologically strange. BUT ever since my friend turned me onto green about 2 years ago, i've had nearly everything on the menu. and never been disappointed or grossed out by anything.my favorites: number one absolutely has to be the mexi-cali burger. i could eat these everyday. it has the flame-broiled taste of a real burger and even the bright red color of raw meat, but don't let it freak you out. it also comes with hummus, bright orange nacho cheese, and chipotle sauce. this burger is SPIIICCYYYY so beware. their fries are crispy and perfectly seasoned. also love their soy ice cream treats, soy-namis, my favorite being the raisin with captain crunch. their lime-ade, lemon-ade, and teas are always fresh and delicious. i also love the diablo red bowl which is another dish for spicy-lovers and comes with fresh roasted eggplant (yummmm) and tomatos. their pita chips and hummus are to die for. they're crispy chips which i enjoy better than just a regular pita being served with hummus. and their buffalo wings are almost as good as the real thing.green nails vegetarian and healthy mock ups of american food right on the head.~~#~1
Contrary to the reviwers below...I love Matt's. Yeah the wait is long...the place is small...once I went in the summer and I was sweating in my coffee...BUT....This is Phoenix people. When the breakfast choices are a tasty meal at Circle K (heated under heat lamps) or Denny's and IHOP, you can't beat Matt's. I love breakfast. I eat breakfast everywhere I travel on business. I have never had a better breakfast than at Matt's. Fresh ingredients, great food, excellent bread and jam...kick $ss hashbrowns.I wish the place was bigger (and cooler) and the wait not so long. But as a special breakfast treat...you can't beat it.  Just bring your own fan.~~#~1
For the past ten years (ever since FunSports occupied the same unit), this place has been the one-stop shop for my biking needs.  From BMX at age 13 to road cycling in adulthood, SMC usually has what I'm looking for.  The prices don't really compete with larger chains like Performance, but they are reasonable and the service more than makes up for the difference.  When I was getting into road cycling, the guys at the shop were very helpful with selection, fit, and pricing.  A+!~~#~1
Not lesbian/gay friendly at all. I should have read the previous review before going.~~#~0
I'm almost hesitant to tell you about my favorite sushi place because it's already pretty busy...  But oh well.  I love Sakana.  It's a comfortable restaurant, I don't feel like I have to get all dressed up to go there.  Don't let the fact that it's in a strip mall turn you off, inside is small, but nice.  Their sushi chefs are always very professional and keep their bar very clean- that's so important when dealing wih sashimi.  We've taken a lot of people to Sakana and it has never disappointed.  We have tried almost all their special rolls and love their sashimi too.  Their service staff are authentic and sweet.   I've never been disappointed.Now....stay away...cause I don't want to wait for a table....~~#~1
We used to go to this UPS store quite frequently and had been satisfied with their service, but it has been at least a year since we regularly patronized the place.  However, we had a really unprofessional experience here recently.  We went there for rotary services for purchase of home which one employee refused to do and handed off to another employee (because as she under her breath, notary services were a pain).  This employee could not help us either as "he had never seen anything like it, and he didn't know  want to  have anything to do with something that had power of attorney on it."  I guess we are one of the first people around here to sell a home. While we waited for this man to do something, the employee who handed off our paperwork, tried and failed to scan a document to email and was quite verbal and (sorry) hickish about these "stupid" machines.  After looking at all was going on, we didn't want anyone here handling our notary services.  Eek - felt like we dodged a bullet.  Also, don't think I will be going there for any other services.  I felt like my IQ dropped 20 points when I went in there.~~#~0
Another place that is really serene and makes you forget you are in a large city! I really liked the Desert Botanical Gardens and I am totally not into flowers or botany!  We had been to DBG once before for Luminarias, but it was so dark that we couldn't see much. I'm glad we returned in the daylight.We took my inlaws yesterday after brunch and they absolutely loved DBG. My father-in-law is totally into photography, so DBG was awesome for him. We saw tons of people with cameras, so it is a photographer's haven.  I really had no clue there were so many types of cactus. There are hands on activities scattered throughout (probably for kids on field trips) and boards with information, which comes in handy on the Sonoran Desert Trail when you want to figure out which mountain in the distance is Camelback, Piestewa, Four Peaks, etc.  We saw little lizards, hummingbirds, quail, and ground squirrels while wondering around as well.There is much to see and you can get through the gardens as quickly or as leisurely as you would like. We spent about two and a half hours there, which I think is a perfect amount of time. You see everything and are ready to leave by the end.  A very nice place to take visitors on a nice day.~~#~1
I indulged big time at Indulge Burgers & More during Fat Tuesday yesterday.  There are a tremendous variety, including many healthy options such as a turkey or veggie burger.  The best part I like is that you can build your own burger with all sorts of yummy toppings.  I had the turkey burger, and the turkey was one of the best I have ever tasted.  Sometimes you can taste like of the darker meats and fatty parts, but I felt like this burger was very clean and lean.  I would highly recommend the sweet potatoe fries that you can order.  You can deep those fries in what tastes like a warm marshamallow dip.   The price is not too bad either for what I call a luxury burger.~~#~1
Bosa Donuts at Southern and Mcklintock in Tempe is part of a strip mall that I have been visiting since I was just a kid. Except, back then, Bosa Donuts was a Taco Bell. A few years back Taco Bell moved a half mile down the road into a new building and Bosa Donuts set up shop. About a year ago I discovered another new store in this strip mall which is Fallout Games, an awesome video game store. For this entire last year I've been driving past Bosa on my way out of the complex after visiting Fallout Games and taking a curious look as I drive by but until this week I had never tried it. After reading all the positive Yelp reviews, I had to give it a go.Well, first off, It's 24 hours, which is huge in my book since I'm almost always up until four or five in the morning. The drive through display is lighted and shows their menu but you have to actually order by pulling up to the window. Since I was there at 3am I asked what was fresh at the moment and the guy was very patient and helpful with listing off what he had available. I just got a few frosted donuts (or raised, as they call them) and was on my way. Right off the bat, I noticed the box was pretty heavy. I only ordered a half dozen but it felt at least as heavy as it does when I get a dozen at Dunkin Donuts. When I got home, I opened the box and realized their donuts are at least thirty percent bigger than Dunkin Donuts of Krispy Kreme.Anyway, the donuts are awesome. Best tasting donuts I've ever had. I probably shouldn't make it a habit to come here twice a week, if I want to live past forty, but I'll definitely be stopping by once or twice a month from now on. Hope this place sticks around.~~#~1
We went there right before my Grandma's 100th birthday.  There were about 20 of us.  The place was busy but we called ahead and they put our name in even though we still didn't have a final count of people.  The place was busy but I know why.  EVERYONE had a different dish and we all loved it.  Everyone wanted to taste each others food because we all liked it so much.  We all seem to think we are food critics and we loved this place.  Extensive menu and they seemed to nail everything we had!  The staff was amazing and would go back in a heartbeat!~~#~1
Definitely the best choice of eating chinese food in the city where you have limited good Asian food around. The Singapore street noodle (curry noodle) is always been my favorite and the crab wonton is just a great appetizer to start! I also like their orange beef! Definitely worth to eat for!~~#~1
"You want a piece of me?" said the gargantuan mango tango eggees cup. I said "YES, I DO!" and give me a big ol veggie samich and some fries to go with my brain freeze thank you very much. Todays order is same ol same ol 12 inch whole wheat extra veggie grinder with extra crispy fries and a bigee flavor (mango tango) $6.50 w/ the captain card. How can you beat this kind of scratch for two people. you cannot.It was Yuuuummmmae!Unfortunately there is not much choice for vegan here but its all about the eegees!I now will add eegees to Best vegan for the money! and to Best far away vegan. Check it! you will be glad you did!Review timeCurbage: 10 I really like the fancy shmancy new eegees,but I like all eegeesP factor: 10 very clean as usualOrdering: 10 no wait at allMeal arrival: 10 even with extra crispy fries it was fastTaste test: 10 yummy today and the mango tango is now my second fav to cherry ciderSummary: 10 Thank you eegees! see you next month.Late gordo~~#~1
I was also roped in with a flier on my door, and ordered this a month or so ago when they had their deal for free cookies, salad, and drink with a pizza order.  Upon delivery, I was given another coupon for the same deal and a few weeks later received a handwritten thank you note for ordering with them and a coupon for a free order of cheesy bread, no purchase necessary.  Needless to say, this has become a go-to pizza option for me.  4 stars for food taste and quality, an extra for great service and good deals.Salad is pretty average but good enough for me with a pizza, pizza is particularly good, cookies are awesome, cheesy bread is cheesy enough but not just a pile of melted cheese.  Their sauce is really tasty- tastes fresh and not too sweet.  Delivery is free, and on time.  The longest time I've been quoted for a pizza (at 7:00 on a Saturday) was 45 minutes, and they got there in 23 minutes (I wasn't timing them but I did notice how quick they got there).  They have a hot'n'ready special that's only a dollar more than Little Sleazer's and ten times better.  And if you don't think it's good, you get your money back.  So really, you should just try it.  Okay?  Okay.~~#~1
Delicious yet again! Pho, garlic green beans, papaya salad...they can do no dish wrong. The owner, Justina, is hip, cool, gorgeous and awesome! It's BYOB so bring a nice wine or beer...no corking fee so don't forget to tip well!If you're eating and there's a big line of others waiting, please do what we do and go across the street to gelato so that other people don't have to wait an hour.~~#~1
Marcellino and Sima are finally back after their yearly 1 month Italy vacation (re-opened September 10th)....and are we glad they are back!  We had a fabulous duo appetizer: fresh fig and prosciutto and the second was a filet (carpaccio) with shaved mushroom and black truffle!  Delicious!  I've always been a fan of prosciutto and melon, but the fresh fig was tremendous!Marcellino also brought us a fresh black truffle cream for his crusty bread, mmmm, amazing.  I don't think you can get this anywhere (fresh), even here if you ask for it, but we were lucky to be in the right place at the right time!Pasta duo was tortellini with even more truffles and a wild boar pappardelle.  Best hand made pastas anywhere.  Perfect!Main course was a perfectly cooked filet with his mashed potatoes and julienned vegetables...and more truffles!  So right...so full!  I'm so glad we had an hour spinning class before embarking on this journey!We ended up skipping desert and had some left over to go!  What a perfect Italian dinner paradise!We can't wait to go back for opera night...and of course we are waiting for his next wine dinner.  Best in the valley.~~#~1
When I found out that they do banquets here, I was quick to make a reservation for a wedding rehearsal dinner.  The service was as good as it gets...period.  The food choices my wife and I had to decide on were plentiful, and the result was beyond fantastic!  From the appetizers, to the main courses and finishing with yummy dessert...this place rocks.~~#~1
Fez is RIGHT down the street from where I work, hence due to its location + general fabulousness, it has become a regular spot for happy hour.Here's What we LOVE about Fez:-Sweet Potato Fries (sooo good--sprinkled with cinnamon by the way)-Kisra and Hummus!-The Black Bean Burger (the first time I ordered it, I asked the server: "Now, is this one of those really bad black bean burgers or does it actually taste good?"  She said, "I totally know what you mean, no this one is good."-and she was right!)-Margarita Mondays (aka 2 for one Margaritas--check out the pomegranate one!!)-The atmosphere--blue and green tones while still being warm-The friendly service-The close proximity to light railHere's what we don't like as much:-The slow service (sometimes it gets kind of bad, I feel like you have to be an active restaurant goer and hail down your server--otherwise you may never get to order, get more water/another drink, or get your check)-When happy hour ends (I mean, who likes that anywhere?)Fez makes me very happy to work in downtown Phoenix.~~#~1
i go to debon every 3 weeks for aki the hairdresser.  she's very nice and asks you a lot of quesitons to make sure you get what you want.  she is reasonably priced.~~#~1
This place was great... Well as great as a doctors visit can be.  They called us (my son was the patient)  back within 5 minutes and immediately saw a doctor.  She was kind and took her time - asked a lot of questions and did not hastily diagnose and fully explained to us what was going on with my son's health.~~#~1
This is true personal training at a fraction of the cost. It's fast, convenient, clean & friendly! You choose the style of fitness YOU want, and your workout program will be designed specifically for YOU. And you will see your progress after each session. AWESOME!!! I like it so much I'm going 6 days a week!~~#~1
If you are looking for only raw vegan food, this is your place.  Nothing is cooked, everyhthing is 100% raw.  They offer a variety of creative options from appetizers, wraps, soups, pizza and pasta.  They have freshly squeezed juices, smoothies and a variety of different health shots.  The dessert is yummy as well.  This is a must try!~~#~1
This place is disgusting!!  The bun was dry and stale.  The veggie burger was yucky... I don't think I have ever had one I didn't like before.  The kids meals are miniscule.  The topping bar is so simple and plain.  The dips are not very good... cheese dip is YUCK!  Drink choices stink.  Cookies taste raw and boring.  Almost forgot to add that the two young kids didn't even care for the french fries because they are seasoned.  I thought they were a total waste of calories.  I can't believe the prices either... so not cheap or even worth what you pay for.~~#~0
Authentic mouth watering food.Got the steak fajitas dinner....extremely satisfied.~~#~1
I love that they are kid friendly and that chef Aaron came by to ask how everything was. Delicious food.~~#~1
I cannot believe I am about to say this:AIRPORT FOOD IS GOOD.For any of you who eat in airports on a regular basis, you've surely come to accept the fact that airport food just sucks.  It doesn't matter how much you spend:  the bread is stale or soggy, meats are dry and tasteless, and forget fresh veggies and fruits of any quality.I was just shocked when I visited the Roadhouse at Sky Harbor recently.  I had an hour before my flight so I ordered a Stella Artois and a french dip.  I wish I'd had a camera to catch my expression when I bit into my sandwich.  The bread was soft and warm.  The meat was tender and tasty.  The cheese was really good; no joke this was real cheese.  And HOT au jus?  OMFG I almost freaked out it was so good!  I couldn't wait to tell my server how pleasantly surprised I was.  She kinda laughed at me and said they get compliments on their food all the time.  AT AN AIRPORT?  Folks, this is the best kept secret at Sky Harbor.  I will make it a point to go out of my way to eat there in the future, even if my gate is in another termial!!This place is in the low B gates - try it and you won't regret it!~~#~1
Amazing food and excellent service. LOVED the porcini rubbed delmonico.~~#~1
One of my favorite places to satisfy my sweet tooth!  I typically will get sorbet, and on this evening I decided to get the Raspberry sorbet.  I believe that this Gelato Spot location has the nicest ambiance of all the locations.  After getting my sorbet, I enjoy sitting out on the patio.~~#~1
This was the first place my husband to me out to eat out when we started dating, OMG I loved it. The staff is always extremely nice prompt at this location, we enjoy their food and I epically am in love with the 99 cent margaritas they are the best. We always have a wonderful time here new and old memories.~~#~1
I am a transplanted Midwesterner, so I love me some breakfast.  And by breakfast I mean:  Hashbrowns, sausage, bacon, pancakes, and biscuits and gravy.  Mike and Rhonda's makes a mean breakfast with huge portions.  For $7 you can have bacon/sausage/ham with hashbrowns, 2 eggs, and biscuits & gravy/pancakes/toast.  Come hungry or share.They also serve classic american lunch fare:  burgers, chicken strips, fries, meatloaf, etc.~~#~1
This is one of the franchise store of Ritz Camera in Chandler. The store's staffs are nice, however, their photo lab is miss leading. They make the price in very small fonts and hanging on the ceiling. For the first time user to print photos in the lab, I was charged for $45 for just few 4x6 and 8x10 print without sign-in as member. I asked for canceling order prior they print the photos. I was told "Too late" even it's still in one of their store pc for ordering prints. Since they are franchise, I should be able to return or exchange the accessories I bought for my Nikon D70S camera in different store. I was told "No". I can only exchange or return to the stores I purchase them. I will not buy anything from them again.~~#~0
I wish I could rate this place higher but my blow out is terrible. I asked for a blowdry with lots of volume and curl. It seemed that the cross between the mai-tai and cosmo would be perfect. My hair is flatter than what I walked in with. My hair is curly naturally so has decent volume, but for some reason its flat! Also the stylist pulled my hair alot while blow dryng and apologized for hurting me which I appreciated, but have never experienced with a blowdry before. I don't think I'll be coming back, sad since I love the concept and the salon is lovely.Update: They offered me a make up blow out. I decided to try the place out again, thinking it was a fluke that my blowdry was so awful. Mistake! Not only was my second blowdry here mediocre, I ended up paying for the service. I wrote to their manager who had offered the complimentary blowdry, but no response.~~#~0
Well, I guess the bar is much lower in Flagstaff, as we went to their restaurant in Glendale for breakfast.  It was less than mediocre.  Starting with the coffee, which tasted awful..it was very bitter and watching the waitress pour old decaffinated coffee into a regular coffee pot! Unacceptable.  I had bacon and eggs...fair. Asked for the hashbrowns to be well done..didn't make a difference, I guess, as they came out raw.  Also, asked that my toast be dry...came out saturated with butter.  My husband had the chicken fried steak with gravy...you could have plastered a house with the gravy!  As you can tell, we will not be returning.  The reason we went, was because of their article in the paper this week.  Just shows, that you can't believe believe everything you read.  My husband, "jokingly, suggested, that we cancel the paper!~~#~0
I love, love, love the Keg!  I've been to this location as well as San Tan Village, Tempe Marketplace and Desert Ridge and have had nothing but exceptional food and service. I really like the atmosphere, it has that dark, cozy steakhouse feeling without being too stuffy or pretentious.  We enjoyed an excellent  Halloween dinner here last night which included a "Keg sized" glass of Fetzer chardonnay, a margarita (very strong), the Keg Classic Dinner (ceasar salad, 7 oz filet wrapped in bacon, mixed vegetables and a loaded baked potato), bacon wrapped scallops (an appetizer that I ordered for my entree) and their fabulous bread with whipped butter, YUM!  Our server was very outgoing and friendly and offered suggestions as far as the menu.  The bill with tax and tip was $68, really an excellent value. Overall, a great meal and dining experience.  I will definitely be back and can't wait!~~#~1
I decided to break from routine and get a haircut at a local Great Clips. I called ahead and asked if they had an experienced barber that could do a flat top. The lady assured me that they did. I was Leary to say the least when she sat me in a chair of a 20 something fibbertygibbet dressed like Madonna. Half way through this butchering, she asked my advice and then the advice of the owner on how to accomplish this haircut. Kid you not, it was an inch longer at the sides than the center. I looked like a cross between the Gunny and flock of seagulls. I went home, set the clippers on 3 and finished the job......Would not go back here unless I lost a bet.~~#~0
I am OBSESSED with Ra.  Thank God that it is a chain restaurant otherwise I don't know how I would get my fix when in different states.  I don't care what everyone says about the best sushi, blah blah blah.  This place is THE best!First of all it has the BEST happy hour!  I was introduced to the restaurant's best items during happy hour when it was less expensive to be adventurous.  My absolute favorites are the Sweet Onion Salmon, Salmon Carpaccio and Shishito Peppers.  The Sweet Onion Salmon's sauce is to die for, the Salmon Carpaccio is soft and creamy with a nice kick of wasabi and the Shishito Peppers have the most amazing garlic-type sauce!  I usually order the peppers with a side of white rice and drizzle the sauce on it for a more filling meal.  Other favorites are the RAckin shrimp, Uchi No Salad and Vegas Roll--basically any of the happy hour items are great!Oh and I can't forget about the desserts, if you have any room left you have to try the cinnamon tempura ice cream, but share it because it is very filling.~~#~1
The best Asaian store around. Love the selection. Awesome smoked herring for cheap. Everything is so much cheaper and better than any other Asian store I've been.~~#~1
we visited on april 15th and And also Sunday April 22..I have twice now gone to your restaurant and twice been told that I couldnt use my BOGO coupon. The first time my mother went to pick up our order, she was told we didnt order the right food and we had to order off the main entress. The second time we ordered, I was told that we had to order off of the DINER SELECT menu. I did not have my coupon handy, and when I was able to read it, it says specifically, "Offer valid for one complimentary Diner Select with the purchase of another entree. Complimentary Diner Select must be of equal or lesser value to purchase entree. Valid entrees include SIGNATURE DISHES, BOWLS, SALADS, DINER SELECTS AND LETTUCE WRAPS." So why, on two separate occasions were we told conflicting information and not allowed to use the coupon, thus spending a small fortune on food, TWICE?!?!? Your customer service is far from what it used to be and I doubt you will be getting more of our business any time in the near future.~~#~0
What can I write that has not been written about the greatness of In-N-Out Burger! Maybe my love is borne of the separation from it my primary residence in Dallas compels. I hope that when it opens in Dallas (yes, the plans for that are public), nothing changes.~~#~1
Steak cooked to perfection.~~#~1
The parking is my beef with this place.  Why does a customer have to pay $12 for each time we park at the garage?  If you move in and out three times, that's $36 for parking.  Yes, my company was paying, but this was just outright stupid and I wouldn't make my company pay for this again.I've been to Phoenix twice since then, and I've avoided this place and stayed at the Marriot.  Much better place.~~#~0
So glad to have found great Thai in my neighborhood.  We thought when we moved away from Tempe that we had lost our access to great ethnic food.  Luckily we found this little gem.  Great ambience, friendly quick service, and fantastic food.  We ordered the green curry chicken and the drunken noodles with vegetables.  Great sized portions for reasonable price.  We got ours on a 3 out of 5 scale of heat and it was perfect for us.  I have a feeling we'll become regulars.~~#~1
As far as indie record stores, this is truly as good as it gets in the valley.It is a breath of fresh air because it is a REAL record store, and you can sample CD's along the wall to get your music fix.I love how they have a list of recommended new releases. I definitely refer to them if my music is getting stale.Recently, my husband and I have bought albums from Beirut, Andrew Bird and Iron & Wine. They have everything your heart desires- so go and get you some!OH- and I just found out you can buy concert tickets there, and they usually give out a free "Magnet" magazine with each purchase. Woohoo!~~#~1
The owner has changed hands & this place isn't what it used to be.  If you want up to date paper & quality product...go to Scrap Happy OR Crop Girls!~~#~0
One of the most memorable breweries I've been to, not because of their personal beer choices but because of how they run the place. They have over 30 beers on tap from all over the country. If that's not cool enough, the entire back wall of the place is refrigerated coolers full of bottles and cans of even more craft brews that you can hand pick to drink in house...OR....build your own 6 pack to carry out. Brews from all over from Epic, to Dogfish, to Maui Brewing, to Sierra Nevada and the list goes on...and on....and on. It really is a nice concept!! Oh....and their food is great too. Mostly your normal bar food but pretty tasty.As for the service? I was incredibly impressed at how the girls that were serving us really truly seemed to have some serious beer knowledge. They were able to help us pick the right beer for our liking and they were right there when the brews disappeared regardless of the fact the place was packed.Know before you go: Don't let the exterior fool you! It's a small portion of a strip mall...look hard or you may miss it~~#~1
Been a patron since this eatery first opened.  This is honestly one restaurant that has not been hurt by the economy.  The food is that fabulous!  My absolute favorite salad is the Turkey Waldorf.  My children always get the side Caesar with Potato Cream Cheese Soup.  The husband always gets either a Cranberry Scone and Onion Bagel slathered with cream cheese OR a Pretzel and some sort of sandwich.  The only downside to this eatery is their lack of seating space during the lunch rush hour.  Get there by 11am if you actually want to sit inside, otherwise on a windy and cold winter day you might find yourself outside sitting on the patio (as I have done in the past.)Even with the lack of seating during rush hour lunch....I'm giving this place five stars and making sure I'm there before the rush hour.  :-)  Happy Eats!~~#~1
I love this place. It is one of my favorite Antique shops in the city! There is a wide selection and variety of booths and items. There is everything here from match boxes, cute purses and hats to retro/vintage furniture, wacky mannequins, old cameras and old toys to reminiscence over. And! They are decently priced and have a nice helpful staff.~~#~1
Jon, Tess, Charlie, Erin, Kathleen and whole gang are the best!!!~~#~1
Our waiter was Vincent. Very polite, helpful, accommodating, and knowledgeable about the menu and the taste of each item. Service was A+!  The food was fantastic. No errors, was tasteful, unique, and fresh! I will definitely come here again.~~#~1
Holy WOW Batman!This place is ONE-OF-A-KIND...it's Awesometown & it's YUMMY!Once you step inside you'll instantly  get the picture.    It's WOW factor is off the meter.Smeeks sells a never ending selection of treats of all kinds...it's THE PLACE for unique, off the wall, goofy gifts.   AND CANDY. I give a big round of applause to LOCAL, small business owners who stick their necks out in ANY economic climate but in today's woe-filled world of running a business, they become instant SUPER HEROES!If a picture is worth a thousand words, you can take a peek at 25,000 more reasons to visit Smeeks here:http://monkeywonderland.com/blog/~~#~1
Wish I could review this place on service but I wasn't able to get one.  Walked in at 1 PM on a Sunday afternoon for a mani pedi, was told by the front nail tech to have a seat.  I get it, I walked in on a Sunday afternoon so they are going to be busy and I am fine to wait.  My wait turned into 30 minutes and no one said a word to me.  Then the front nail guy tells me it is going to be another 20 minutes before someone would be able to get to me.  You know your salon, you know your techs and how long it will take them to do a service as well as how many people are in front of me so it would have been nice to have gotten a expected wait time before I wasted an hour my time.  I ended up leaving and going to another salon who saw me right away  The place in general was dirty, nail polish spilled down the wall and dust everywhere.  I did not get to see how clean their pedi baths and chairs were but the front waiting and front desk area was filthy.~~#~0
OH MAHHH GOSH, what retards they have working here. Came in to pay for my phone bill and literally stood in line for 40 effing minutes. They had TWO ppl out on the sales floor that afternoon and the store was freaking packed. Really? What genius decided to schedule TWO freaking meat-heads who knew diddly squat about anything on a busy Saturday afternoon??? And no, I don't care to upgrade my phone. I JUST WANT TO PAY FOR MY BILL AND GTFO OF THERE!!!! Do you really think that after such poor service I am going to want to up your commission rate by purchasing/upgrading my phone with you? NO.~~#~0
Definitely an awesome buffet.  Not your typical buffet stereotype.  Love the sushi.   Great variety of things to have.  If memory serves,  it was 19.99 when I was there.  I think a tad high, but someone mentioned 25 bucks, so maybe it's come down :-?  Sake is priced well, and the beers.~~#~1
MMMMM. Let me break it down for you...when you can hear staff in the kitchen saying "oh wow, that looks amazing" as plates are coming up in the window, you're in for a treat. I mean the fact that they see these dishes time and time again and are still excited by them....! Then flash forward to the next day and if you're heating up second lunch (I like to eat) in the office micro and employees comment on the delicious smells, yeah you're doing a-ok! I was solo this time because Gabi M was home with baby Mess and I didn't think to call Jarred (sorry bud!). Eating alone certainly wasn't as much fun but it was delicious. Eggplant is a must. You just HAVE TO get it, done. In addition I also had a really yummy chicken dish with wide noodles, veggies, basil, and a spicy/sweet sauce. SO tasty. The portions are enormous, so don't balk at the prices. Grab two entrees, share with the group, take home leftovers...that simple ;).Know Before You Go:  I'm only in Scottsdale one every other month and Tottie still remembers me when I come in, and that rocks! Big fan.~~#~1
Been a loyal customer since they opened ten years ago.  Quality cut and great people. These are professional barbers who have been doing this for years.  No froo froo!  Russian not spoken there!~~#~1
Had lunch here with my wife today. It's the second time I've been and her first. After my first visit it rocketed into my top five favourite restaurants of all time. They have some top notch food, and the best thing is that it's such a deliciously welcome change from the bottom-feeder's Mexican crap that you see all over Phoenix. The menu is varied and I think I eventually will want to try everything. Appetizers include fried alligator and frog's legs. The main I had today was their Mardi Gras Pasta, which is linguini with tomato, thin-sliced garlic, andouille sausage, crawfish meat, onion and delicious shrimp topped with a really nice creamy sauce. Absolutely delicious. The wife had mahi-mahi with an even NICER sauce, and dirty rice on the side. Although a tiny bit on the pricy side it's definitely worth coming back to. Large open seating (outdoor seating also available), dimly lit, old-style jazz, a large full-service bar and a very quaint outside waiting area with water feature, giant fans etc. The service was also great and both times I've been, the waiters have been very helpful (the first guy told me that if I got the large serving of alligator, to try it 'half-blackened' - a great tip which allowed me to taste both 'styles' of the appetizer). They also have things I've not heard of before like etoufee and opelousas. If my dad didn't live over seven thousand miles away I'd take him here in an instant - he'd absolutely love the place. You will too.Oh yeah, they have creme brulee (with fresh fruit) and sweet potato pecan pie, amongst other things, for dessert. We had the latter - yum.~~#~1
Owned by a serious, James Beard nominee, this is high taste, funky fun for killer Mexican food.  We sat at the bar, and joked with the cool bartenders for a while; all the time trying a myriad of different tacos.  Every single one was great!  This is the real deal, with a creative edge.~~#~1
I hate for my first official review to be a one star review but Macayo's really disappointed me last night. When I first pulled into the parking lot last night I was surprised to see how many empty parking spaces there were. I immediately got excited because normally any restaurant on Bell road any night of the week has a wait. However, when I walked inside I saw a slew of people waiting to be seated. I walked up to the hostess stand and put my name on the list and the hostess did not give me a time quote and when I asked how long it would be she quoted me, "not too long." We waited about 15 minutes before being shown to our table which is where the trouble really began. Once we were at our table we were quickly greeted by our server (yay) however, she told us she had another table's drink order to get and then she would be back for ours (boo). So we waited for her to take the other two tables drink orders before coming back to take ours. After about 10 minutes we got our fountain drinks and then 5 minutes later she came back to take our food order. Then it took about 50 minutes for our food to come out. Seriously, 50 minutes.... that's about how long I planned to spend at Macayo's not how long I planned on waiting for my appetizer of taquitos to take to come out. And to top it off we were missing a side of rice and a side of baja sauce. We decided not to mention it as we did not want to wait another hour for the two items to come out. So, after eating and waiting for our drinks to be refilled 3 times we finally got the check to which the server apologized for our wait. Apparently, she couldn't have apologized at all during our 50 minute minute wait she needed to wait until tip time. I don't recommend going to Macayos. You might have better luck at any of the other 10 Mexican restaurants on Bell Road.~~#~0
If I could give zero stars, I would. Just about the worst experience for my friend and I. We came in for a quick and easy dinner.  After being ignored at the door way repeatedly, we sat ourselves.  First, we had a girl server who said shed be back with menus, but right in front of us at the bar we see her flirting instead of coming back. Our server switched to another guy who was just as bad at serving. I have no idea how this place ever received more than one star based on the staff alone. They're lazy, slow, and completely ruin the entire experience of dining there.  The happy hour prices are great, but there are other RA's so do yourself a favor and go to a different location.~~#~0
Superb gelato - some of the best I've ever had! The guy behind the counter is the owner, and he takes pride in his gelato.They only use real sugar, not high fructose corn syrup, and nothing contains hydrogenated oil.I tasted a few flavors and settled on the coconut... it was sublime. Definitely some of the best Gelato I have ever had. When I need a mid day sugar rush... I'll be back!~~#~1
Best steak I have ever eaten is at Ruth's Chris steakhouse. Comes to your table sizzling hot. Sides are sold individually but are pretty good. The deserts and appetizers are awesome. Being an upscale place be prepared to take a hit in the wallet. If you really want to impress a date this would be a good place to do it.~~#~1
The last time I was at The Vig, they tricked me.. You see, they have these glass doors that they open up in the back of the restaurant when its nice out, and sometimes, when you go through those doors from the outside to take a trip to the loo, they close them on you, so like an asshole, you attempt to walk back outside the way you came, but instead you bash your head and knees into the glass window in front of 35 people. Be mindful of this.But hey, at least they had the most amazing wine specials that night and I was saucy enough to laugh it off and take a bow. And then I hid in the bocce ball pit for the remainder of the evening where I somehow acquired 200 bruises. I love the Vig. Even when I'm embarrassing the shit out of myself.~~#~1
I'm so happy this store is located so close to my house! Every time I come to this store I get great service. I mainly use this store to get food items for my dog or the grooming salon - where Zombi has never had a bad experience. This location also has a Banfield Vet Hospital, PetsHotel, Doggie Day Camp, Training services and at times has adoptions. My best friend has used both the PetsHotel and the Doggie Day Camp for her pooch and has never had a bad experience. I also used the Banfield Vet to get Zombi up-to-date on her Rabies and the Vet was super nice. The best part was that I didn't even have an appointment, I just walked in and they were able to fit me in after a five minute wait.My only pet peeve (pun intended) is there is usually only one cashier working and the line can get pretty long. However, it doesn't take long for another employee to open up another line to speed up the check-out experience AND they usually show up on their own, without customers complaining about only having one cashier. Bonus!~~#~1
I visited this place in January while I was in Phoenix and I miss the food! My vegan friend suggested this place to me and my other friend (we were skeptical that vegan food could taste good)...she proved us wrong!The food here was delicious, I'd eat here regularly if I lived in Phoenix! When we arrived, we were worried about the hours since we got there pretty close to closing time, but they were cool! We shared the samosas and buffalo wings for appetizers. I ordered the Thai Peanut bowl with mock chicken and noodles for my entree. I felt like everything was flavored well and while I enjoy meat normally, this opened my mind to trying other vegetarian places in the future. I liked the ambiance here, great place to grab a bite with friends and chill. It was the perfect place to stop by after a busy weekend! I'll be back next time I'm in the area.~~#~1
This is one of my favorite little gems in Phoenix. I've never had better pho than here. I usually order the "spicy beef sate" pho, which is miles above the rare beef pho. My family and I also order the pork "spicy treats" which is a roll-your-own spring roll. It's delicious and fun! One order feeds all five of us. The owner is also extremely nice. They also offer discounts to ASU students! Have to love that.~~#~1
Im going to have to agree Whole heartedly. And i informed the manager of it as well. I picked this one because it was close to the Airport and the Light Rail. The noise from the Airport wasnt to bad. But it was the Train Horns all NIGHT LONG and ALL MORNING when your trying to sleep. I wouldnt pick this one, the neighborhood wasnt bad despite what people say. But the Train noise is just unbearable. I got it for the Click 6 rate which was reasonable. Stay Elsewhere. I should of picked one further down that was right off the light rail.~~#~0
I should have taken my own advice and stayed far away from this place. Our most recent visit ended hastily when I was served rotten tuna and got barely a "sorry" from the staff. I could smell that the fish had gone horribly, horribly off when the ahi tuna salad was put before me by the waiter, and I'm shocked that the kitchen actually thought they'd get away with sending it out. The waiter disappeared so quickly from my table that I had to go hunt him down to point out the bad smell at my table was coming from the food, and he took my plate back to the kitchen and five minutes later came back to say, "okay, we all smelled it and there's definitely something wrong there."Seriously? You had to go pass it around to confirm that I'm not crazy when you can clearly tell within ten seconds that this is not how raw fish should smell? After all this, their solution was to comp an appetizer, not the salad, and eventually gave me a new salad to go, which I decided not to eat just to be on the safe side. Look, I'm not scared to eat week old leftovers or sushi at a divey joint and I don't really get freaked out by the cleanliness of restaurants, but this could have been dangerous.  I have absolutely warned off all my coworkers and friends against this place, and now I'm warning all of Yelp. It could have been handled in a way that left me confident that it was just another new restaurant kink, but the awful service made it clear that's not the case and I shudder to think of what new low they'll sink to.~~#~0
Love this place.  Friendly staff. Always a treat to see what's cooking on the weekend. I don't mind standing in line to order. Great way to meet new friends and talk to old ones. Ask Kiersten about the cortadito.~~#~1
Paradise Bakery is one of those places that you can count on for always having something good when your driving around wanting more than a burger and not a sit down meal with a waiter. I love the Cranberry Turkey sandwich with fresh fruit. The nice thing to consider is that you can get a whole or a half on the sandwich of your choice.Once you feel good about the healthy choices you've made you encounter the cookie section at the register. All I'm going to say is that the chocolate chip is to die for!! The chocolate chips just melt in your hands!! Doesn't get any better than that!! Paradise Bakery does also have a great breakfast should you want a nice place to go after a nice hike or just want to treat yourself and a friend to great place to visit. Put Paradise Bakery on your "always good" list!!~~#~1
Some of the best Italian food I have ever had. This is a favorite for my wife and I. Sima and Marcellino are very nice people, very inviting. The bar is small but fun to hang out at. The food is always fresh and delicious.Watch out for Marcellino - he likes to push the truffles.~~#~1
True Mexican street fare - at first a little intimidating for this Gringa, but it was awesome.   The owner Dan (who happens to be a Culinary Institute trained chef) put together a variety pack for us.  Everything is small and cheap, so you can get a whole bunch of different stuff to try.  $30 fed 5 people.On the NE corner of 19th Ave & Glendale, next to 7-11.  Give 'em a try - you won't be disappointed!~~#~1
I had lunch at Lon's and wow, what a great experience.  Great food, great service and great ambiance outside.  I met the Chef at an event and he was less than friendly.  Maybe he was having a bad day?  His unfriendliness aside, this is a must try if you are  in the area.~~#~1
I love this place! Been to a few different locations and the pizza is always excellent. Yesterday, my boyfriend stopped by the Camelback and 10th St. location and picked up pizzas to take home (he called in advance, as the pan pizza takes at least 30 min). I had a veggie, tomato, basil, garlic, and he had a meat combo-pepp and sausage. So delicious. The only complaint he had was the parking situation there. It is kind of tough, but well worth it. I absolutely recommend Oregano's!~~#~1
I was really disgusted with this place. I should have known when we walked in on Saturday at 12:30 PM and there was no one (not exagerating)  there.  But we were hungry and hot so we stayed. I wanted shrimp tacos but no shrimp at tacos del MAR...just frozen fish that you need to order 5 minutes ahead because they need to microwave it.   It's breaded and precut...couldn't they at least get the kind that has different shapes and looked like it wasn't completely processed?  The kids had bean burritos which they usually love anywhere but didn't like at all. My husband's chicken burrito tasted like a school cafeteria.  The clincher was that the unsweetened ice tea tasted rancid.  I think they let the tea bags go bad or something.  Gross and how annoying that they  don't have seafood.  Wahoo tacos from La Jolla please come here to AZ!!!~~#~0
What a restaurant! Absolutely loved my experience at Tarbells. I've been hearing rave reviews for quite sometime and decided to try it out recently. My party and I sat at the bar, which was a great choice because the bar was comfortable, rather large and really social and fun. The bartender (young woman) was fabulous, inviting and very nice! She was very attentive. A guest in my party dines at Tarbells often and she had his drink in front of him by the time we walked to the end of the bar.....Now thats some customer service for ya!Food = We started with the Calamari. A favorite dish of mine and this one was outstanding. Two very different but delicious dipping sauces. A roasted red pepper and a pesto mix. Not sure which one I liked more :) I enjoyed the pan-seared jumbo sea scallops. TO DIE FOR. I am a huge scallop fan and these were done just right. Caramelized, giving them the right amount a sweet....and it was served over very yummy risotto. Another dish enjoyed by my party was the Fennel Sausage Pasta dish, the fennel sausage was AMAZING. Overall experience was fantastic, as soon as I get another opportunity I will be dining here again! :)~~#~1
NOTE:  I only had take-out, and it was brought to me by my boss.  She rules!She got me a hummus/grilled/marinated chicken combo.  It has 3 different hummus...es...es (HA!): roasted red pepper, jalapeno and plain ole' hummus.  They are sectioned off in the big plastic container, which rules for my OCD, as I don't like my food touching.  In the center is a PILE (a total monton!) of grilled chicken.  It's got some sort or spicy rub on it, but not too much kick.  It had been marinated, too.  And tender....I think this is the most tender chicken I have ever had.  It made my own tender spots as juicy as the chicken was!I'm not big on pita, so instead she got me a side of cukes.  This thing weighs a ton and I've been eating it for 2 hours.  I have made a mess in my "Make me Yelp" boyshorts.~~#~1
I live in LA where these shops are on every corner.  I can say without a doubt, this is the best FroYo I've had!On top of that, the store staff is super-friendly and the place is immaculately clean.  They are also serving gelato, pastries and fresh coffee/espresso.  Check it out!~~#~1
will review after I eat. Ok so we ordered a Mongolian beef combo plate, sesame chicken (YUM) and pork fried rice , and sweet and sour pork. This was really really  good food. Good prices. When we are in the area we will definitely go back.~~#~1
This is a good store for your beauty needs. They are open until 8pm too which is nice.~~#~1
Wow. I'm not even going to wait until I'm done before leaving a review. I just placed my order, 30 minutes after sitting down.11:35 - Sit at a table for 8 an order drinks. So far so good.11:39 - Things were going alright when we had a table of 8, but when a few more people showed up to attempt to give Floridino's some money in return for a quick lunch, all hell broke loose.11:41 - There was a room next to us with a bunch of empty tables. "You can't sit in there. We don't have a server in there." Screw it, we picked up our drinks and moved in. If they can serve us at that table, they can serve us one table over in this other room.11:45 - We asked to see the manager.11:50 - "We can get you drinks in here, but not food. We have to wait for a table to open up out there. Then we can serve you."11:52 - Someone who looks like a manager peeks into the room and leaves. We still haven't spoken to a manager...11:55 - "We don't want to overwhelm the kitchen." (Hmm.. If you didn't want to "overwhelm" the kitchen, maybe you should have taken my order 20+ minutes ago...)12:05 - They're taking our food orders in the Forbidden Room. I guess they're not as allergic to accepting our money as they led us to believe.12:32 - Just received my food in the Forbidden Room. Pretty much exactly an hour after I got here.You suck, Floridino's.~~#~0
Still my most favorite hot dog ever and I think the magic is in the presentation. They've got the best hot dog sleeve. It perfectly holds the dog, lots of chili and it's not messy.Another must have is a Cherry Lime Squeeze; Sprite, Cherry flavor, squeezed limes and maraschino cherries.~~#~1
Healing hands!  A dedicated, professional  therapist/intricate bodyworker who listens to your needs to develope an individualized treatment.  Focused in addressing  my health concerns and goals.  A message like no other that left me  feeling restored with the added bonus of "spot on" nutritional advise ... an overall concern for your good health!   To feel renewed ... highly recommended!!!!!!!!~~#~1
I go there often. Love the food. Love the atmosphere. Great beers & usually great service~~#~1
Went to Sol for restaurant week.  Was less than impressed with the bitter salad with MIA avocados, the carnitas that were very bland and boring, the rice was delicious, however the black beans tasted like aspirin, dessert was a dulche flan that was hard, solid and icky.  Service was average, took 2 hours to get thru dinner.  Best part was the refreshing wine and beer!Cheers to SOL, we wont be returning.~~#~0
Had a wonderful birthday dinner at CIBO last night. This was about the 3rd or 4th time visiting this quaint house turned restaurant, and now is the time to YELP. CIBO has wonderful appetizer of antipasti that played with my taste buds! Fun to make your own brushettas.... My husband and I shared the Rustica delightful, delicious, delectable.... And the creps...what can I say...I didn't need it, but I wanted it, so I had it, so there! Fresca creps with fruit, vanilla ice cream and fresh whip....Mmmm...food coma. Lovely service and birthday!~~#~1
I was surprised by the depth and distinctness of the olive oil.  I was expecting oiliness with hints of flavor, but instead was pleasantly surprised by bold flavors carried on an already flavorful oil.  This place far outshines other oil stores which add flavor essence to their oil.  They infuse the flavors here, making them stronger and more authentic.Overall, great oil and balsamic vinegar.  Try their food, such as the sandwiches.  And definitely try as many oil samples as you can.  The oil is not too expensive, ~$20 per bottle.  Well worth it if you like to use it on bread or to add some great flavor to a salad.~~#~1
Best cajun food in town, not just from a truck.  Phoenix doesn't have the greatest selection of cajun offerings so I was amazed at Food Truck Friday to find Jamburrito.  They have a pretty stellar selection of meats & meals considering it's from a truck.The spices were perfect - just spicy enough to enjoy but nothing that's going to harm.  I had the catfish once and the jamburrito twice... not in one sitting because the portions are VERY filling.~~#~1
Great service, atmosphere and of course great food. My wife and I decided on Blue 32 last night for dinner. We have been there many times, but we felt we needed to share our experience.  We enjoyed sitting at the bar having a few drinks and visiting other patrons. Around 9:50 we realized the kitchen would be closing. I asked Daniel and Baeley the bartenders what time the kitchen served "dinners" of course he stated 10:00pm "OOPS". But Daniel said they would prepare what ever we wanted.  I asked him to check to see if they have already started to clean up first. We do not like to ask the kitchen staff to prepare dinner if they had already began or completed clean up. Daniel returned to say that yes they had finished the grill, but he again repeated that they would still prepare anything we wanted. At that time we declined to have the kitchen staff prepare anything. But a moment later, Roman the chef came up to us and sincerely stated that he would be more than pleased to prepare whatever we wanted. Still we were not wanting to make such a request  that late, but with his sincere and friendly personality he still insisted that they were more than willing.  So we asked him to pick  and prepare something of his choice which turned out to be the best two burgers that we have enjoyed in a long time, a Bacon Cheese Burger and his speciality Texan Jalapeno  Burger both with extra crispy bacon just the way we like it. SOOOOO....we would highly recommend Blue 32 and it's staff including by name, Roman the chef and Daniel and Baeley the bartenders.  Every time we have gone to Blue 32 we have had nothing but a great experience, this place is a must!!!~~#~1
I would not recommend this place to anyone.  I went there looking for a gift.  I received no help.  The girl was too busy helping the wives of the baseball players.  I guess you need a large bank account to receive help in this store. Also, they did not have a very good selection of items. I think I will take my business to other stores who care about their customers.~~#~0
I took my computer to RedSeven recently when my friends were calling and telling me I had a nasty virus that was sending out gobs of email every fifteen mins.  I had no idea my computer was infected.  I was hesitant to do so because I needed my computer to do some work. No worries, the fellas over at RedSeven hooked me up with a loaner.  I was able to get online and get my work done and get my home PC back the next day without missing a beat.  I was going to take my computer to one of those BIG BOX store repair places. I am so glad I didnt.  A friend of mine took their PC there and when it came back all of their family pictures, music and email was gone.  I will only be using RedSeven in the future and I suggest you do the same.~~#~1
I have to admit, I normally don't like Chinese food. In fact, it's just about the only style of food I haven't fallen in love with at some point in my life. This is a real problem when you live with someone that would die for Chinese food at all hours of the day/night. I figured out why I never liked Chinese food when I first ate at Asian Cafe Express. It's because everything I've had has been Americanized Chinese Food!!!  It was like an epiphany and seriously music to my tastebuds when I actually found Chinese food I not only liked, I LOVED! Having authentic Chinese food changed my opinion completely about this cuisine.I have to agree with the others... save yourself the time and skip the first few pages. Go straight to the back of the menu to find authentic Hong Kong Style fare. Holy mother of god, everything I've tried has been outstanding and each time I leave saying it was the best meal I've tried thus far. Everything is extremely cheap and the service is superb. The wait staff are always very helpful and knowledgeable about their food. They'll be quick to recommend something if you're having a hard time deciding. Just ask!~~#~1
Like Sex or Tobacco? Hells yeah!!!! were not looking for vanilla yes' here, this place pulls out all the stopsIf  Ichi Yakaguru the new york club promoter and 9yo Japanese pimp needed anything, it could be found here.The best selection of DVD's and printed material i have come by in awhile... lots of Toys so much stuff a lot of it is hung above the head, so look up.Lingerie, Tobacco, Human Fire Hydrants, Hobos with Soap Sud Beards~~#~1
Been here twice now and wish I could say more. The food is delicious, the set up is really relaxing and service is great. A great place to take an out of town guest. Happy hour menu has these amazing tofu tacos that I highly recommend. My boyfriend had the Pork tacos which he said were also delish. Definitely check this place out!!~~#~1
Mims Burger & Mexican Food was revealed to me by my sister and sometimes when I think about it (even when I JUST ate), my stomach growls.  The restaurant itself just SMELLS GOOD sitting there and waiting for your food to arrive.The strange name would sort of, you know, ordinarily turn me off from trying the place because I think when restaurants serve this AND this they usually just serve two wildly different forms of food, both of which suck.  Mims serves legitimately good Mexican food, burgers, hotdogs and everything else.Even if you're NOT in the area, it's worth going a bit out of your way for it.Five stars.  Places don't get much better.~~#~1
I was searching for a unique item to give as a Thank You gift and I stopped by Practical Art over the Labor Day weekend after viewing some items on their website.  I was extremely under underwhelmed by the service I received and do not plan on returning.  When I arrived the young woman behind the counter was having a personal conversation with an acquaintance.  Besides the employee and her conversation buddy the store was empty.  I spent about ten minutes looking around and the young woman did not have the common courtesy to acknowledge me with a simple "Hello", even as I was viewing items directly in front of the counter.  When I was leaving the store she did break long enough to say "Bye".I believe it is very important to support local business but I will not spend my money here.  I did find several items I wanted to buy and made note of the artist. I have done the extra leg work to reach out to them to find out how to purchase their items through other channels.  I do not feel they should miss a sale due to the sub par customer service at this location.~~#~0
Went into the location and waited minutes for someone to appear to ask us for our order and even after we said Hello they didn't acknowledge us. Had to repeat order several times. It was very frustrating how nothing seemed to be in stock, no philly cheese steak nor soup was available. I heard someone as I was leaving being told some type of bread wasn't available (which is actually understandable, condiments and bread sometimes run out or need to be retrieved/baked). Felt like we were being rushed and just didn't feel like a clean place. Will not go back.~~#~0
Dear Lo-Lo's why do you have to be so damn good!?  I really wish that when I had you last weekend you had been dry and tasteless so that I wouldn't have to come back and eat Fried Chicken and Waffles again... but now you have made me an addict to your delicious mouth-watering juicy breasts & thighs... Woah where is this going?! LOL Thank goodness you do takeout for now my husband will have to do his husbandly duty and pick me up a piece or two on his way home from work.... Truly wonderful... I never had waffles with fried chicken before and I'm not sure why I was so surprised at how great this pairing would be but I was... Great service, everyone was friendly and upbeat and seemed to actually enjoy working there which is definitely a PLUS! ;-) I love you Lo-lo's!~~#~1
I have completed this run (obviously not the 27th annual edition) 5 times now. The course is always the same - a bit hillier than other Papgo courses as it takes a right along the sidewalk behind the zoo, but the organization is always excellent. The t-shirt is another good draw to this event - a long sleeve shirt that changes color in the sun. There is always food at the end, a raffle, and a great crowd. One of the best events on the racing calendar each year and an excellent way to start the new year off right!~~#~1
This is my absolute favorite restaurant in Phoenix. This is where we go to celebrate and to enjoy a night out with amazing food and great service. Noca is an experience. I wouldn't recommend trying to quickly hit up a meal here before trying to catch a movie. I can't imagine trying to rush the experience!On our most recent visit I immediately ordered my favorite cocktail- the Dirty Bird. It's so perfectly crafted and smooth...plus there are bleu cheese stuffed olives. Sold! I felt a little bad because my fiance wanted to celebrate our new jobby-jobs with prosecco... my bad. Lay off me when there's bleu cheese stuffed olives and vodka involved mister!First up was the mixed salad. I love how it's not overloaded with cheese and candied fruit. It's the perfect balance of flavors. We then had the lobster roll and it was absolutely heavenly. I really hated to share that but I needed to save room for the scallops. The scallops were so perfectly cooked and the plating was gorgeous. The flavors were outstanding- absolutely sublime. Ryan actually asked me if I remembered his name. I just smiled.~~#~1
I found this place based on Yelp reviews so I feel obligated to add one more 5 star review to the mix. I needed to get a chain fixed on my bike and was not looking to spend a ton of money or hours trying to fix it myself. So I stopped by and had them take a look at it. They recommended a full tuneup to keep it in tip top shape and spent the time explaining and demonstrating why it is deserving of spending money beyond the chain repair.  I ended up passing but didn't feel like they were trying to take advantage of me. Since it was close to closing time I left the bike with them overnight and got a call late in the morning the next day for pickup. It has been as good as new ever since. Having my fair share of riding in the Valley of the Sun I'm sure I'll be back soon for some inter-tubes or a spare part for whatever craigslist bike I happen to be riding around at the time.Protip: Check out the unique bike artwork they have around the place. Also they have a small BMX (?) track in their "backyard" you can ride around and do jumps on anytime.~~#~1
I had such a great time at this place both times i went.  The first visit was a sushi dinner extravaganza with my sister.  The place was literally a 10 minute walk from my childhood home, where my parents still live, which was the first bonus for this place.  Once i walked in my excitement grew.  The place was small and intimate although a bit on the hot side.  Our waitress spoke with a heavy japanese accent and she was very friendly.  We ordered a bunch of rolls, they have a fairly small selection of rolls which is fine with me, and some nigiri.  They even had Uni!  i dont know how it is in phoenix but i live in Salt Lake City and Uni is incredibly hard to find there for some unknown reason.  Anyways the sushi was well prepared and tasted very fresh.  Their yellowfin was just amazing!My next visit was a lunch with my mother a few days later and we ate mostly non-sushi offerings which were also very good.  I had yakisoba which was delicious and my mother had the bento box with teriyaki steak which was also fantastic.  This place is a real gem and for me personally the location is perfect.~~#~1
Wedge salad is delish! Love the fact that it's organic, as well as the fact that the pizza dough is gluten-free...sure beats having my husband sneeze for an hour, after eating "regular" pizza. I will say, the pizza is pretty good...and this is coming from a girl from Chicago!~~#~1
Parents, please let ur children explore on their own!  I c parents following their kids around !~~#~1
Originally came by to get a watering system for our chickens and ended up buying something for every member of our furry family! They have everything here for cats, dogs, small birds, rabbits, poultry, horses and more! The customer service was excellent, we were even given free samples for our chickens without even asking and were given informational sheets about some awesome products we ended up buying as well. Both of the people working were concerned with taking their time to help us, not about making a sale, and will even special order some products for us if ever needed. We don't feed our dogs dry food anymore (they now eat raw instead), but when we did, these are the premium/healthiest brands we were buying at a much higher cost at other retailers.The prices are low, the hours are convenient, the customer service was great, the products are healthy, and the selection was large for how small the shop is, what more could you ask for? Great first visit and we will definitely be coming back again!~~#~1
Everything I have tried here is awesome! You can't go wrong with your choices! Service is ok. Could be better. Not very personable!~~#~1
If only I where rating this place based on their sushi I would give it 5 stars.  But, I'm not  rating it based on the food.  It is purely based on the customer service in this establishment.  Be warned; if you have a large party this is NOT the place to go.  I've been in the restaurant industry for over 20 years and I have NEVER heard of a restaurant not splitting checks for large parties.  So for an over 500.00 bill they will take 15+ different forms of payment but won't split up the check by individuals or couples.  How does this make any sense.  To make matters worse; they bring out the sushi and I quote "family style".  Since when did sushi get served family style?  Here is the problem.  Sushi is expensive, not everyone at the table ate it and when served "family style" someone else may get what you ordered and you won't have a clue it even made it to the table.  We spent over 40 minutes trying to figure out this bill, SERIOUSLY!  When I asked the manager her generic and obviously well rehearsed response was "this is our company policy, we do not split checks for large parties".  This is absurd.  So not only did we have a heck of a time figuring out the bill, I'm pretty sure no one really knew who had what and if they had added random things to the bill.  How could you know with that many people ordering????  I never received part of what I ordered yet it made it on that bill.  So here we have to pay it regardless of what we may or may not have received?  I understand that adding gratuity to a party this size is also common practice which I don't normally have a problem with but how about some EXCELLENT customer service in return.  If policy is no separate checks, at least tell everyone as they order or as a group that this will occur.  They said someone was told when the reservation was made.  The reservation was made for 25 people!  It would've taken 2 seconds to again relay this important piece of information.  Worst experience ever!~~#~0
I went here on a Saturday night and sat outside listening to the band playing in the background.  It was part of the Music Under the Stars, or whatever it called, very cool and fun though.  BTW, I see a lot of people commenting on how loud it was, to all you yelpers, take that with a grain of salt, it's a pizza place near a large family residential area on a weekend, what do you expect, I guess it's an expectation thing.  By no means is this going to be a quiet candlelit dinner for two.  It's a classy, family oriented pizza place. We ordered the caesar salad and small pepperoni pizza. Very well priced, and the pizza in my opinion tasted delicious.  It seems like everybody has some weird opinion on how good pizza is, and I guess I have a weird opinion as well.  Here goes...the size of the small, is not small it was more like a medium (value! winning!)(sorry lame Charlie Sheen pop culture reference) anyway, it had a faint sweet taste on it which i really like, the cheese was good, not too much sauce, and the pepperonis were very flavorful.  They were the small kind and they were just great.  The Salad was good, salad is salad, it's hard to mess that up.  We were helped by an awesome bartender/server named Chandler.  Cool guy, really nice, he kept us entertained.  We'll be back I want to try some kind of meatlovers next time we go there.~~#~1
There's a certain amazingness that comes from fresh made ice cream.  It's soft, creamy, and not filled with high fructose corn syrup and preservatives to keep it together for months in a freezer.  Growing up in Arizona, we always made homemade ice cream in the summer and if you've never experienced homemade ice cream, just go to Churn.I had the banana ice cream with caramel sauce on top.  I can't say anything bad about it at all.  If someone doesn't like their ice cream, it's because they've been subject to all the fakeness added to ice cream in the stores and national ice cream shop chains.  The shop has lots of toys and candy and knickknacks that will give you a sense of nostalgia.  I'll tell you what sounds like the best day ever:  riding my bike down Central on a beautiful Phoenix day... stopping in to Churn for an ice cream break (and then popping into one of the restaurants nearby for a cocktail).~~#~1
Top notch. He is now my go to barber. Charged only $16 for cut and beard trim, but I throw him a tip on top of that for an exceptional cut. He will ask you questions throughout the cut to make sure you end up with the cut you came for. Can't go wrong with this guy. And what a cool place!~~#~1
By far my favorite Mediterranean restaurant in Arizona!  The service is always awesome, the place is always clean, and the environment is always welcoming and friendly.  I love hole in the wall, family-owned restaurants because [at least the ones I have been to] there is always a sense of pride in their service and their food.  I've been to this restaurant a few times and have loved everything I have tried.  I like being able to taste flavor, not seasoning, and their Dolmeh appetizer is just that: a perfect medley of herbs, grape leaves, and rice.  I usually order the #6 - Beef Kebab, but I have tried their #3 - Chicken and Gyros and #7 - Lamb Kebab.  The meat, be it beef, chicken, lamb, or gyro, is always moist and tender.  Like their meat, the grilled vegetables have a perfect blend of crispy and lightly seared on the outside, but juicy and steamed on the inside.  The basmati rice is always thoroughly cooked and flavorful.  The same goes for the Homous, Baba Ganoosh, and Yogurt Cucumber Dip.  I highly recommend their house Combination Platter.  The pitas are always warm and their homous and ganoosh have the perfect texture.  Try to go around 5p to beat the dinner rush.  The place is always packed on Saturday nights, so show up a little before regular dinner time if you want to ensure seating for your party!~~#~1
i just finished licking my fingers clean and almost ate the dressing-drenched paper that held my very first, and surely not last, lucky boy international burger.crispy bun, tons of dressing, fresh lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and onions, and a perfectly tender, smokey burger. thick, perfectly salted, crunchy on the outside and soft and burning hot on the inside fries. thick and deliciously sweet chocolate and peanut butter shake.gone. in less than 5 minutes.place closes early, so unfortunately there will be no drunk trips through the dangerously narrow drive thru.~~#~1
This is a GREAT place to eat! One of my favorite lunch stops as you can see if you follow my facebook photos "Lunch With Stew". My favorite thing there is the Buffalo Chicken Pizza. mmmmm, mmm. Kevin O'Donnell is from the Texas Hold'em family of final tables and occasionally will play the tour. Super great guy and he also has a super great restaurant and sports bar.~~#~1
Amazing sandwhich joint. A must go place to eat!~~#~1
5 stars all the way. Let me begin by saying that I'm a big fan of the products. The store is done in very warm tones and the drinks are incredibly aromatic and these 2 things combines seem to make all my stress melt away when I step in the door. I'm not a huge coffee fan, but I can order some of the coffee drinks here. I'm completely unable to drink the caramel frappuccino from Starbucks, but I can't get enough of the caramel ice blended from Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf.So now that we've established that I love the product, we can move on to the real reason this place gets a 5 star review--the staff. I've never seen anything like it. If you come in 3-7 times someone will probably know your name and might even know your drink.Leila is the best at this. She knows peoples names, their drinks and if you come there often enough she even knows which car you drive. She'll see a regular customer's car pull up and she'll have the normal drink ready and waiting for them by the time they walk through the door. THAT is the epitome of customer service.~~#~1
Quick spot for a mall-made mayo-based California roll. This is where you go to learn how sushi can go wrong.You've been hard at work doing swipe-and-sign. Perhaps you even dropped a thousand bucks at Neiman's on a worthless Jhane Barnes' sweater and some silk-lined Zanella slacks or three thousand on a whats-left-of-last-season's-collection of Brioni blazer. Whatever your fancy, you're toting a wrist full of roped, glossy, shooshing-sounding bags with tissue paper sticking out the tops. You just want a break and some cool refreshing sushi.It's OK, but beware. Unagi and other "hot" items have a "beep-beep beep-beep" before they get to you. California and spicy tuna rolls come real quick -- 'cause they come from a vat of mayonnaise. Rice is not right either. Stick to tuna and salmon sashimi and miso soup.If head chef Rick is there (think Kyoto of Empire at 24th and Camelback, then Ichi Ban, University off McClintock), ask him to make you a Fat Bob on Acid, for good ol' times' sake. Or just go to Starbucks, tide yourself over, and find a real sushi restaurant.And about the Brioni... Don't sweat the buyer's remorse. It'll make a great tax deduction to Florence's.~~#~0
Stay in the courtyard recently and have no complaints at all!! RIght when I entered the place , the staff greeted us and they were all very nice and helpful with everything. Although i only stayed there for 1 night , i thought the rooms were very well kept and the bed was amazing! The first thing i do when i check into the room is look at the bed and sample how if feels and this bed was amazing! The rooms are about normal size and has a tv , desk , chair , etc..... Wifi is also a must whenever i travel and no complaints here. Wifi was fast and easily available. Did not have a chance to see the gym or the pool but they do have one. Overall , i would stay here again if i come by Phoenix!!~~#~1
I usually do not complain about bad food but the fish and chips gave my wife a serious case of food poisoning.  So if some manager reads this please check out your fish supply or change the cooking oil.  She never gets sick and has been sick all day (December 29, 2012) from the meal eaten December 28, 2012.~~#~0
Still in love with this place and how much care they really have for all of their clients. I hit another, I want a piercing moods and swung in on a lunch break last week, determined to get this piercing I thought would be perfect on me. As usual Jo was absolutely amazing. He brought me back and we discussed what I wanted and when he looked at how my ear was shaped he said that I may want to try something like this (then drawing dots where they would go). He took into consideration my piercing past and said it's subtleness and the petite jewelry would suit me well.And as always, I came out super impressed and ready to show off my piercings. They still look amazing a week later. I'm still in love, and they are perfectly healthy. Job well done. But I'm not surprised.~~#~1
part of a social event, we only had app's here. quite delicious crab cakes and a shrimp fritters with mango sauce. the portions were gigantic and actually big enough for a meal. i was slightly full afterwards. part of the roaring fork, wildfish franchise, they also offer a great happy hour. seems a bit high priced but our bill was taken care of, so i'd save this (for the middle class foodie) for a special event.~~#~1
Okay, I admit it - we are waaaaay late to this party. We tried once before but the hour-plus wait was just two much for the four starving carnivores with me that day. This time our strategy was to go early on a Saturday morning as close to 6:30am opening as possible. We arrived around 7:15 (it WAS the weekend after all) and only waited about 20min for a table for two. I had the special of the day - 3-egg scramble with andouille sausage, fresh local baby spinach and fontina cheese - YUM! The sausage had just the right enough of bam and the home fries with rosemary and onions rocked. My companion had the hog and chick - awesome meaty bacon with that.Great value for the price - I packed up at least half my meal for the starving teenagers at home (who could not be roused at dawn). If you haven't been, get up early, bring a newspaper and rest assured Matt's Big is well worth the wait.~~#~1
Busy place, but everyone is nice and I keep having to go to the cell lot because of late baggage from my original destination. They charge a lot to deliver so better get your bags checked 45 mn early...~~#~1
We love Dr Steve!~~#~1
This mall has all the upscale shopping that you will ever need. Just make sure you come here with your credit cards in check as you are bound to fall in love with something when you come here.They have some of the best department stores in my opinion, and if you're looking for that perfect dress for any occasion, you have tons of options to choose from.I love how clean and perfect this mall is!~~#~1
This is a great Radio Shack.  The staff are older, and very knowledgeable with their product line.  If you need odd batteries, check this store out first.  I needed a watch battery, and found that they were the only store in Phoenix to carry it.  It cost be all of $5 bucks, but saved me having to buy a new watch.~~#~1
Not only does this place get it's ingredients directly from Italy, it makes a variety of flavors fresh, daily! I got my first taste of gelato when I visited Rome Italy a few years back. I've tried other gelato spots around the U.S, but nothing has caught my AMORE, or the authentic Italian flavor, more than Angel Sweet. So far my favorite combo is the "most popular" Panna Cotta with Banana, (which an employee recommended), Hazelnut and Pistachio, as well as SUPER Dark Chocolate again, with the Panna Cotta.Don't forget your punch card, buy 12, and get one kid's size free!~~#~1
I LOVE LIFE TIME!!  It's always clean  plenty of machines to work out  on  that are in working order!  HUGH VARIETY  of classes to take and keep you from getting bored.  My kids LOVE it too and ask when we are going to the gym.  They also have the rock climbing wall, basketball and Squash courts and outdoor and indoor pool with life guard and a water slide at both.  The out doors  and indoors have a lap pool as well .  The inside has 2 extra large jacuzzi  and of course your steam room and saunas. I personally love the locker rooms they are so nice to shower and get ready in they provide everything you could think of ( just like a 5 star hotel!! )  This place keeps me motivated You Gotta try the Zumba class and Strictly strength class!!!~~#~1
My son and his family arrived into Scottsdale Tuesday April 10 on there way to California. We decided to eat at RnR before they continued there trip.  My son and my wife ordered a hamburger and fries. The fries had no taste and my son asked for two new orders. My grandchildren ate the original fries, while the new fries loaded with Parmesan cheese. The fries were not hot, nor had the cheese melted. I had a few of the fries and did not have as severe a case of food poisoning as my son and my wife. I have recommended RnR in the past. I do not think I will in the future.~~#~0
For those of you who love Indian/Pakistani food, but hate dives, Z-Grill just may turn your whole world upside down. In all foodie honesty, Z-Grill is home to some of the best Indo-Pak food I've ever had. This praise comes with a reminder though...it is divey.Z-Grill is located inside Zam Zam World Market, which is a decent little grocery, but it lacks the umph that other well-known ethnic groceries delivery. With that being said though, other groceries lack Z-Grill, and this is why it matters...Everything I've tried from the restaurant, and I mean everything thus far, delivers. From the hummus, to the samosas, to the chana and even to the paneer masala and chicken karahi, I've only been disappointed when I realized that I was down to the last bite. The flavors are robust, the sauces are spicy and, surprisingly, the prices are unbelievably reasonable.  It's safe to say that I'm addicted to this place. **A word of caution when trying Z-Grill. They are sometimes out of items on the menu. I find that charming cause they have to make everything from scratch, others might not. If they happen to be out of something, do yourself a favor and just try something else.**I cannot say enough good things about the food from Z-Grill. This is a must-try in the valley for anyone who has a love for spicy Indo-Pak food. Go try it!~~#~1
EXCELLENT TRIP TO THE SPA!!!!! A trip to the Aji Spa (located at the Sheraton Wildhorse Pass Resort and Spa) was at the top of my list during my recent trip to Arizona on Memorial Day Weekend. We made our reservations well in advance. Having gone to a few spa resorts, I couldn't wait to pay this one a visit. My cousin and I were each booked for the Little Yellow Bird spa package, which was comprised of 2 services each. We arrived about 15 minutes prior to our appointment time and was given a tour of the spa. After changing in the women's locker room, and relaxing in the private women's lounge area (there's a large lounge area, but it's co-ed), our masseuses met us and brought us into our room. My cousin and I decided for our first service to be the Companion Massage. After only having solo massages, I was interested how a companion massage differed. The 50 minute Aji Massage flew by. My masseuse was professional and the massage given was very comfortable, relaxing and beneficial. After our massages were completed, we had some time in between our next service, feeling a little hungry, we decided to grab some lunch from the spa's cafe. I ordered the flatbread pizza and it was TO DIE FOR! Seeded flatbread topped off with a garlic peppery aioli, grilled chicken pieces, pesto sauce, marinated bell peppers, melted cheese and avocado. My visit was a month and a half ago and my memory, a little fuzzy, but that was one of the best lunches I've had in a long time!! After lunch sometime, we each were up for our second service, our facials!!! Due to my skin type, I received the Aji Rain Facial. My esthetician was wonderful! Her hands were soft and gentle while working on my face and we had some lovely conversation during the 50 minute procedure. I left that room with my face feeling renewed, clean and fresh!All spa treatments include full use of the spa's facilities so we definitely made well use of that! After our facials, we used the sauna (the steam room was out of service during our visit) and whirlpools located on the women's locker side. We then relaxed and lounged by the outside pool. The Aji Spa is such a calm, warm and relaxing environment that I ended up taking a nap! Outside! In desert heat! Thank goodness for the wooden awning with misters attached and the huge patio umbrellas providing shade! The staff at the spa provided excellent service! From the front desk, to our masseuse, the esthetician, the cafe staff and the locker room attendant! While napping, one of the staff from the cafe even brought us iced water with lemon and cucumber slices in it!Our appointment started at 12pm and with our 2 procedures, and lunch, we should have been done and out of there within a few hours. But the point of visiting the spa was to relax, and with Aji Spa being such a lovely place, we just didn't want to leave!  We finally left nearly 8 hours after our arrival, and we would have stayed longer if we could! I highly recommend Aji Spa to anyone visiting the Phoenix area, or if you're looking for a new spa to travel to! Aji Spa is a beautiful spa with excellent staff and service. They even emailed me the same day of my service as a "Thank You" for visiting and included a discount coupon on my next visit! A 5-star spa, indeed!~~#~1
The french toast was delicious! Toddy was especially good~~#~1
This place is awesome. Affordable, tasty food.  Simple and clean country environment.~~#~1
Fantastic Happy Hour 3-6pm! Half price appetizers and good drink prices. I like their Sushi and Garlic Noodles.And pretty much everything I've had there is good. I had a Peppercorn Steak about 2 weeks ago and it was amazing. It's right next to the movies so it's a good place to meetup too.~~#~1
Went here for the first time last week and had a great experience. The restaurant was very clean, the service was great. The best part? The food. I've been in AZ for 10 years now and I can say without a doubt that its some of the best food I've had in a restaurant (and this from a pregnant woman no less ;)I had the fried chicken tenders, cheesy grits and fried okra. First, the food came out piping hot, I mean steaming and hot to the touch. The batter on the chicken was thick and crispy. The grits were cooked to perfection- dry enough to hold together a bit but still moist. And the okra was fantastic, too. It didn't hurt that my fresh lemonade came in a mason jar, either. I will be back. a lot :)~~#~1
The boyfriend and I like to do little staycations every now and then so when we saw a deal advertised for the Camelback Inn we jumped on it. We stayed two nights in just a regular room, I guess. They had several different kinds of suites (even rooms with a private pool!) but our room was a standard room with a nice patio facing Camelback Mountain. The room was spacious and clean, the bed was comfy and the patio was the perfect place to enjoy breakfast.Camelback Inn was much bigger than I expected. Lots and lots of buildings spread out over the property. It's not the easiest place to find your way around but at least it's pretty to look at while you get lost. At the back of the property is a little ghost town set up. It looks like they do corporate events - cowboy cookouts - but nothing was going on while we were there. But we had fun wandering around the "town" and taking goofy pictures of each other.Even though it was December it was warm enough to hang out by the pool. The pool is heated so that helped and there are two hot tubs as well for really chilly days. They have an abundance of lounge chairs and even offer float rafts and fun noodles for the pool. There were kids splashing around but the area is big enough you can hide away from the action if you prefer.We ate at two of the restaurants while we were there - BLT Steak and Rita's Kitchen and both were fantastic. We loved our Camelback Inn staycation and would not hesitate to go back - especially in the summer when the rates are low!~~#~1
Yes, the place is busy every time I go there, and it takes 20 minutes or so to get your orderYes, the inside is cheesy and cheap with folding tables and could definitely use a makeoverYes, the location is...ummm...well lets just say its a "working class neighborhood"BUT they've got the best fish tacos I've ever had, and everything on their Mexico City street food style menu is outstanding. The $1 tacos are "mini-tacos" so get 3 or 4 of them, a couple of fish tacos, maybe a side of rice and/or beans and you will be all set.Go there. Just leave yourself plenty of time, it's well worth the wait.~~#~1
Food--The fire roasted garlic tomato soup is excellent.  They sprinkle tortilla chips for garnish over a tiny dollop of sour cream.  Mmmmm.  Yummy.  The mixed green salad with albacore tuna is also a delightful choice, as is the turkey wrap and CA Chicken sandwich with pesto mayo.  Drip coffee and espresso drinks are good, too.  Overall, everything tastes great because it's made fresh.  No pre-packaged items here.Seating--Lots of booths and tables inside and out.  They have a cozy little set up with what looks to be 'lounge' chairs that accommodates 6 with swivel tables perfect, for savoring your beverage of choice.  The rest of the dining area looks like it has capacity for about 100 people, if all seats were filled despite a placard declaring the maximum capacity is '311'.Peak times--avoid lunchtime during the weekdays.  It would appear that all of Surprise is feenin for a sandwich or soup/salad special from PB during 11-1PM.  The lines are long and you can forget about getting back to work in under an hour if you factor in commute time, food prep & consumption.  IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.  The only time service has been 'fast' is during breakfast.  I've been there for a breakfast networking event and on a Saturday.  During these times, I received my order promptly and had little trouble locating a table.Free stuff--this would include WiFi, bread samples with tasty spreads, muffin and/or cookie bits.  Bonus points for free stuff!PB is open Mon-Sat 7AM-9PM and Sun 7AM-6PM.~~#~1
Awesome! I highly recommend this place! Incredible atmosphere inside and out, the bar design is superb and the patio is the perfect spot for relaxing and enjoying drinks with friends. I went for the second time recently and have to give this place a stellar review. The menu is innovative and fresh! The mixed drinks are killer and the wine on tap was an extremely pleasant surprise. Plus, you can't beat their happy hour seven days a week!  I have had the crab cake BLT and the halibut sandwich, which were both out of this world! Everything I saw coming out of the kitchen looked amazing and I can't wait to go back and try all the others.  The servers were great and knowledgeable about their menu which is always a big plus! As a parent, I love that this place is a perfect day/night out spot for a date or hanging with friends but also a family oriented neighborhood joint where I can bring my kiddo along! Love that Churn is right next door to get some yummy dessert after an incredible meal!  The design is spot on for this area! Great job!~~#~1
Thomas was very welcoming and a great server/bartender. Came in close to close and still gave us ample time to enjoy our late night date. My lady and i's date night are few and far between so to be able to have a experience like tonight is very appreciated. Kudos Thomas and citizen!~~#~1

Let's start by disclosing that I grew up in New Orleans, went to school in Lafayette (home of the Ragin Cajuns), and REALLY know good New Orleans/cajun food. I grew up eating great po-boys, gumbo, red beans, and wouldn't consider eating any of these if not well prepared. That said, I can truly say that Jennifer and the Flavors of Louisiana gang make cajun food as good as any you'll find in New Orleans--SERIOUSLY. The po-boys are spot on (though the bread could be a little crustier) and the chicken & andouille gumbo is even better than mine--and, I assure you, that's DAMN GOOD. Frankly, I've never had better. The only thing that is not "as good as it gets" is the red beans and rice. They're good, but not quite the creamy "Washday Monday" staple that I grew up on. My cajun grandmother has Jennifer beat on that one, but not by much. But, if you want a special treat and want to taste something that kills all, get a sausage po-boy. Hot sausage or smoked sausage po-boys are a New Orleans staple and my favorite po-boys of all. But, Jennifer blows them all away with her home-made andouille. Simply put, I've never had better sausage--ever. It's the reason her gumbo is soooo good and her po-boy the best ever.I've eaten at Flavors many times, even though I live across town. Every time I go, I eat like a pig and bring some home to eat later. I have no affiliation with the restaurant, but wanted to post this as a review from someone who really knows New Orleans food and as a thank you to Jennifer and her crew for giving me a source for the best flavors in the World (not just Louisiana). As a matter of fact, I even overlook the fact that Jennifer is from Baton Rouge, instead of New Orleans or Lafayette and for not having any USL/UL Lafayette paraphernalia on the LSU/Saints wall. At least that is, so long as she keeps her promise to open another restaurant on the east side of town--that is, a lot closer to where I live.If you want the ONLY good cajun food in Phoenix, treat yourself to Flavors of Louisiana. For me, it's just like a visit to any of my favorite po-boy shops in the old neighborhoods. It really is that good.~~#~1
great sports bar. TV's galore. Good food. Outside patio. While many places claim to be sports bars, for some reason they wind up not paying attention to the TV's and wind up with hair removal infomercials playing.This place knows what they are doing with the tv's. I was watching the manager who looked like had a spreadsheet with every game planned out and on what tv's. They also play the sound from the premier game.~~#~1
Probably the best mall I've ever been to. Anchored by five mega stores - Nordstrom, Nieman Marcus, Macy's, Dillards and Barneys New York. It's so big, it took a couple of hours just to walk it.My wife called it the best mall she's ever been too. Nuff said.~~#~1
My wife and I have going to this restaurant on Thursday night for past three months to have a beer and a slice.  A couple weeks ago I went there for the usual but there was an NFL game and a World series game on and the restaurant was busy.  I put my name in and waited for my wife and the table.  30 minutes went by and wife had not shown up and the table had just become available.  Hostess said I can't seat you unless your other party shows up first.  I called my wife, she cancelled.  Hostess would not seat me as a single...TERRIBLE..Hostess did not tell me this when I first put my name in.  WON'T BE GOING TO ANY OF THE ZIPPS EVER AGAIN.~~#~0
I have tried finding a spin class in Arizona that is of the intensity and variety that this studio offers.  Bar none.  The CoreBalance Studio has dedicated instructors that push you to your limit in an encouraging way.  The unique thing about this studio is they use the "RealRider" (or is it "RealRyder"?) bikes that cause you to turn right and left to work your obliques.Outstanding workout! I recommend it to everyone who wants to get into shape.~~#~1
This is another one of those restaurants I would have never known about if it wasn't for Yelp. San Diego Bay Restaurant is tucked away in the corner of a shopping center on the main drag in Guadalupe.It's taken me a long time to review this place. The first time I went was over two years ago and I've been back a few times.  I have to admit, I've never had better Mexican seafood. Unfortunately since it's been awhile, I've forgotten what I ordered. I can tell you this though, every dish has been superb. Each bite was like heaven. I left wanting to try everything on the menu. The servers always steered me towards great dishes with their recommendations and I've taken many people here, much to their delight. They've all raved about it.~~#~1
Picazzo's Organic Italian Kitchen is a gem in the many pizza locations that can be found in the Phoenix area.  Picazzo's boasts a menu which includes appetizers, salads, organic and gluten-free pastas, and of course pizza and dessert!  One cannot go wrong with any of the categories of foods Picazzo's offers, but there are certainly favorites that can be ordered upon ones first visit.

One is greeted immediately by their hostess at the door and then you are seated promptly at one of their many tables (or the bar area if you prefer).  The atmosphere is roomy with their ample seating, and friendly upon entering.One of their best appetizers is their Mama's Meat-za Balls ($9.50).  Made with three meatballs with mozzarella, artichoke hearts, organic tomato sauce, basil, and Parmesan, it is a savory appetizer that easy starts the meal off on the right foot.

If going with one of their creations, I would recommend their "Nonna's Favorite" (gluten free) ($16.50, $21.00, $25.00).

With the finest ingredients, Picazzo's takes great care in delivering the best in atmosphere and dish.  Stop by Picazzo's Organic Italian Kitchen today for an unforgettable meal.~~#~1
What can I say about this place? I love it. Its straight up the road from my place. You can find everything here, not just Asian food. When I get a hankering for Bombay spice, off to Lee Lee I go. I love LOVE their meat counter. I get chills deciding which pork hocks I want. The fish fry service is nice. They have stuff I can't live without and can't find anywhere else i.e. aloe vera juice and those sinfully delicious dessert rice and of course, the makoks. The cashiers can be a lil raunchy though just smile and nod. And a little known secret? The vegetables are freshest on Fridays.~~#~1
I was excited to go to the lululemon athletica at Scottsdale Quarter because I really enjoyed shopping at the previous store that closed in Scottsdale. Well something has changed... I walked into the store and while there were more sales clerks than customers, no one said a word to me and no one asked if I needed any help. They were all too busy talking with one another. And to add insult to to injury... one clerk had to walk around me (didn't ask if I needed help) and went to play with one of the customers dogs.... I had fully intended to buy a Christmas gift there, but left because the service was so poor and I did need help with the sizing.   I went over to the Nike store and had a totally different experience, very positive.  I'll stick with Lucy and Nike where they appreciate their customers.~~#~0
It saddens me to say that this isn't the worst Mexican restaurant we've eaten at, that's on Oahu near Waikiki beach, but it's close.  Damn it we had to drive by Arriba's to get to this place.   I had a chimichanga that was a little anemic, though what there was of the filling was ok,  beans  tasteless, rice looked the part but as spicy as your average UK meal involving boiled meat and root vegetables. Erin's Fajita salad was similarly lack luster  with  all the appearance of being tasty yet   bland chicken. Usually, unless there's an attempt at "chefing" as opposed to cooking  I'll order a basic dish ( I don't shoot the chef though  and trust me these guys are safe from Agent Sands , very safe)  for the first time out  and if the beans/rice suck.. no return.Overall It feels like aliens, space ones, are running the place and they learned cooking from pictures.  It's certainly a mistake we won't be repeating.~~#~0
We were in AZ visiting out for Thanksgiving and really wanted so go AZ mexican food but had to go to a place with a full bar for some Margaritas.  This place came up on Yelp and looked interesting so we figured we would give it a try.  The food was pretty good.  My son had a cheese crisp, wife had beef enchiladas and a chicken taco, Mother-in-law had pork tamales, and I had the beef green chile.  They gave us to big baskets of chips and salsa (which we eat too much of!).  Everything was pretty good, but the margaritas were really good.  I always try the house first time I go someplace since I think it is a good judge of how good a place is and theirs did not disappoint.  I think they should advertise them more because they are so good.  Very fresh tasting!  Next time we go back to AZ we will definitely visit again.~~#~1
This place is perfect! Great food, great service and friendly people. We will be back over and over again! We ordered a few different things on the menu and all were excellent (Stetson chopped salad, scallops, testosterone salad). Lovvvve it!~~#~1
I had a great dinner there.  One of my best in a long time.  It was sucha treat.  Once in a while you have to take care of yourself and just enjoy what life has to offer.  Chef Juan was great to talk to.  Seems this guy has been there sinsr they broke ground.  If you truely like yourself take a walk around the grounds after dinner and smoke a cigar at the big Fire Pit or over by the dock.Life is good.~~#~1
Love it! Closest thing in Tempe to the food we actually had in Thailand.~~#~1
Love this place !Food is spicy and always cooked just right.  Menu changes every so often and have nightly specials too.  Service is great.  No matter what night you go it is busy.it is a great little find.~~#~1
Cibo! Cibo! Cibo!  I love you and your cute old farm house, your amazing pizza, affordable wine, awesome crepe desserts, and fabulous staff!I want to live in the apartment above the restaurant!! Go to Cibo for awesome food, charming atmosphere, and a great time for a girls night or on a date.  Cibo has quickly become my favorite place in Phoenix! *They're closed on Sundays...found this out the hard way.~~#~1
La Grande Orange Grocery has a problem. It can't decide what it wants to be when it grows up, and that makes the overall experience iffy. Is it a quick mart? A grocery store? A restaurant? A coffee shop? Unfortunately, it can't be all of them.I love La Grande Orange Pizzeria, when there is table service, fun wait-staff, and delicious food. But during the day on the weekends, the Grocery is too busy and unorganized to tolerate. It is not set up for the crowd, they do a poor job of line management, and when there is a line to order, the rest of the Grocery is impossible to navigate. To top it off, the counter staff shouts at you when your food is ready. Unnecessary.I'll certainly be back at night for the pizza, the delicious wings, and to partake of the best gelato shop adjacent to LGO. But I'm afraid that I won't be back for the weekend chaos.~~#~0
I found Gaylee to be the most unprofessional nail tech.  I found her on an internet deal.  I called her on Sat and requested an apt on the following Friday.  She never returned my call till I reported her.  She denied my 5 messages and said she only got one msg which she couldn't return cause she lost her voice.  She conveniently had a voice after she was investigated.  I would never trust her to do my nails.  Yet reading the reviews she did return some calls.~~#~0
Thanks for the positive reinforcement talk, and explaining, I just need to take my time. Thanks Robin, you encourage me,I have been sick, and so has my family. I have missed the last couple of weeks and boy can I feel the difference. You know when miss something for a period of time?? Then you have to start all over, but that o.k.Thank you again Jim and Robin for taking those few extra minutes to ask me how I am doing and how my kids are since I have been gone. Thanks so much for caring, weather its about my kids or my knees or the fact that I have a pain pump in my stomach and   have a hard time laying on my stomach, which Robin saw I was not putting full weight down on my stomach. She asked me after class what was going on and if I was O.K. She made me feel important and cared about. Where are you ever going to be working out and after class the teacher checks in with you, to make sure everything is alright. Jim and Robin Love this practice and so do I. I feel what makes them different is the caring aspect. The checking in with you. If you ever have a question, Jim and Robin will ALWAYS take the time answer questions or just see how you are doing!!! Thanks Jim and Robin! I will be back soon!!!! Thank you for being the best Bikram yoga around and thanks for just being non-judgmental, caring, and hopeful for everyone in the class to push harder and just do it the RIGHT way!!!! Love your studio, Love Robin and Jim as people!!!!!!! This is the perfect place to either start or to be challenged.Thanks, Nicole Skarderud~~#~1
My husband and I have been going to the Touch of Thai for years. We meet up there at least twice a month for a lunch date. On special occasions we take friends and family there for dinner. I love the wait staff - especially Nick! His wonderful sarcasm and jokes always make our day! For the amount of food you get at lunch at the price they charge - you can't beat it. Everything is homemade and tastes fresh. #3 Yellow Curry is my hubby's favorite. Rich coconut based sauce with yellow curry. The chicken is tender and the potatoes and carrots are cooked perfectly. I venture off and try things from time to time. The food is spicy. I like the incorporation of fresh herbs into the dishes. The soup served with lunch is always yummy and changes from time to time. We always get a side order of spring rolls. You need to try these! I like the Pad Thai as well as the #5 and #7 lunch specials. Meals are served fairly quickly. Sometimes we have to get up and refill our own water glasses however I find this to be a wee bit charming. Feels like I am home. If you go there on a regular basis the servers remember you, have your order into the kitchen before you even are seated, and always say hello and smile.~~#~1
Pho-k yeah .......and the spring rolls too ........~~#~1
Tonight at Noca PhoenixNo dinner -waited 1.5 hours with no communication only to be told they were out of the fish I ordered left the restaurant 2 hrs later very hungry   Very disappointing~~#~0
I love Sapporo.  They have reasonable prices, a big menu, great music always playing, entertainment (people watching), etc...Their sushi is very good.  They have fun drinks.  If you make a reservation for dinner you usually don't have to wait.P.S.  They have amazing deals for happy hour, but get there early cause it gets packed!!~~#~1
Won't be going there again. Our chicken was pink! Manager was a prick in regards to that and service was all around crappy.~~#~0
Having a miserable experience flying from Boston to Reno. My connection was in Phoenix, and the flight from Boston was running a bit late. I asked both of the flight attendants if it would be possible to deplane before the other passengers as I had a very tight connection to make. One actually laughed at me and told me I would be fine. 12 hours, a horrible nights sleep (as they did not offer me hotel accommodations) and two delicious airport meals later I am sitting in the terminal waiting for my flight from Phoenix to Reno to board. Sorry buddy, not really fine. I missed my flight by 5 minutes. I would have been fine if US Airways offered their customers with tight connections the opportunity to deplane first, as every other airline I have flown on does. Will avoid them at ALL costs!~~#~0
Celebrated my anniversary here. Everything was amazing. Enjoyed the filet mignon and the lobster with prawns. Luis was our server and made our experience truly amazing. He made everything perfect. He gave us our space, but at the same time entertained us when appropriate. He recommended a great wine to pair with the lobster, and made sure we were well taken care. We capped our meal off with creme brulee and a dessert wine. We will definitely come back here and ask for Luis again.~~#~1
Very small, but wonderful food and wine. Some of the staff mentioned that they worked previously at Bomberos Cafe & Wine Bar (now Timo's Wine Bar).The concept of this place is killer.~~#~1
The Harkins Camelview 5 gives Arizonans the unique opportunity to see movies that are normally reserved for screens in NY and CA. Without this theater there would be very little chance to see independent or foreign films in Phoenix. I give a lot of credit to Dan Harkins for keeping this theater open. He certainly can't  make much money at this location. It's financially  impractical to keep such a small theater operating on such prime real estate. This just shows Dan Harkin's commitment to sharing great films with the people of AZ. Thanks Dan!~~#~1
Excellent place for a nice dinner, A classy place to bring friends for cocktails and food~~#~1
Went for lunch. Took over 30 min for food to arrive. Ordered chef salad. Made with processed turkey and ham. Also with processed cheese slices. childs choc milk was not mixed up. Kraft mac & cheese on kids menu. Won't come back again.~~#~0
I love the Valley Ho! It's a beautiful property with great rooms, a fantastic pool, an excellent restaurant -- Trader Vic's and a really nice spa. Be sure to stay in the newly re-modeled Loft Suite. It's two stories and it's fantastic! If I was to take a stay-cation, I would be sure to stay at the Valley Ho! And for all you out-of-towner's who want to stay in Old Town Scottsdale and be close to great shopping, restaurants, and nightclubs, the Valley Ho should be at the top of your list!~~#~1
Going to Desert Botanical Garden is the perfect field trip for a beautiful day like today... I've been to DBG a handful of times for events, exhibit openings, meetings, and of course Yelp In Bloom (a yelper party that I planned a couple of years ago)... but today I went with my son and we met some other friends with the sole purpose of checking out the butterfly exhibit.We didn't get lucky enough to have a butterfly land on us, but we did see tons of gorgeous butterflies.  There were orange butterflies and yellow butterflies and striped butterflies, etc... The flowers in the pavillion are pretty to look at as well.  We visited the gift kiosk afterward and took home a butterfly finger puppet, which I know we will get tons of use from (only $6.25). The exhibit runs until May 13th, so don't miss it!And if you do find yourself with more time while you're there, definitely check out the design for a living world exhibit as well... I saw that when it first opened and it was really cool.  The photography alone is worth a visit.I just wish I had more time to explore DBG more often!~~#~1
This place is awesome. Just bought a loose super powers darkseid. Will def be back for more. Lots of loose figures. Great prices and friendly staff.~~#~1
This place gets it right from the moment you walk in the door. Signed baseballs jerseys and bats by legends on the wall, a friendly host to greet you and when you sit down they ask if you want free chopped liver. It comes with bits of egg and onion, warm rye bread and bagel chips. Our waiter, Jeff, was friendly and attentive, even lending us his flashlight to read an old newspaper story in the rafters. The cream of mushroom soup made from scratch was superb. Our mains were baby back ribs, the specialty of the house, cooked perfectly with a flavorful sauce. The 'broasted' chicken was to die for: moist and juicy with a crispy outer skin. The fries were piping hot, as they should be. And the portions are beyond generous.We topped it off with key lime pie, light and tasty, an ideal complement to the meaty mains. And the bill was under $60, an amazing deal. As a bonus, some of the players drop in during spring training.~~#~1
My family has been going to Dr. Brittan for 10 years.  He is an excellent dentist and can handle any situation you can throw at him.~~#~1
Love this store!~~#~1
I'm not a big "organic" kind of guy.  I could care less about hormone free this and BPA free that.  For me it all about flavor and service - it has to be better than I can make it myself and you have to take better care of us than I can.Having said that, I'm HEAD OVER HEELS in love with the food at Tryst!  Service is family oriented too.  They treat you like a regular on your first trip in the door and burgers are to die for.As a die-hard burger man, this is my default stop.  It is close to the house, in a pleasant shopping center, and has the best burger I've ever eaten in Phoenix.  I'd give it an extra half star if Yelp would let me.  This place is that good!~~#~1
After eating chocolate covered bacon for desert (yeah, that's really one of the options for desert), I say that I was completely stratified with Beckett's Table. From the moment I called to make a reservation I knew that this restaurant was going to have great staff and service. The staff greeted us at the entrance and give us options for seating. I was VERY pleased with the pricing on the menu especially the wine bottle prices! It's just a matter of time, and I will be back for an evening meal! Speaking from living in the Arcadia area, this is just the restaurant we need in the area--a nice community restaurant with pleasing food! If you are looking for a nice dining experience, this is the place for you!~~#~1
The whole market is awesome.I like that if you did not bring enough cash with you that you can pick up a blue ticket at the information booth that the vender will stamp then hold your items for you then you may pay by credit card at the information table where you picked up your ticket.The veg are great.the free range eggs are the best.the french baker from Tucson is pretty darn good.this market is for sure one of the better ones I have seen.worth any one checking out.Note support your local produce and growers/farmers.Support Organic!! One more note this information and option has to do with the farmers market out side open on the weekend from 7am to 11am~~#~1
The best fried chicken I have ever hadpork cutlet is not to be missed eitherthe collard greens flavor is unbelievable and purely vegetarian broth if you can belive that - absolutely no sournessI regular have to make pilgrimages for my pregnant wife here.Negative - cash only~~#~1
The food is simple, pure and uncomplicated; you taste (and hopefully enjoy) each ingredient. However, as with most minimally processed cooked foods, it does not travel well.  So, eat in. Luckily the decor is modern and compliments the menu well which makes eating in a pleasure.   My only down note is on the service. If you are not careful when you enter the restaurant, you may enter through the door of invisibility and will become invisible to the employees. As a result, you may stand at the counter while they work around you but do not recognize your presence until the invisibility dust (or whatever makes you invisible) wears off.  Based upon my late lunch experience today, the dust takes 4 iPhone e-mail responses or texts to be removed (10ish minutes). Regrettably, I only had three unanswered e-mails in my inbox and had to leave before I could be seen by the employees. On a positive note, when you leave (regardless of the time you waited), the invisibility dust seems to be removed. I know this as no one honked or screamed at my car as it drove away without a driver.~~#~0
For frozen yogurt quality, I give this place a one. Honestly, it's small, there's very little variety in terms of toppings, and the yogurt tastes cheap... Probably because it's a big franchise. There is a reason why you're paying less for an ounce... Truly - you get what you pay for. The concept is neat, sure, but if you're looking for pizzazz then you should try Yogurtini... It's just up the road from Yogurtland. Anyway, the single star says it all... "Eek! Methinks not."~~#~0
Ii am addicted.  spectacular service and consistent, quality. food every time. i have been ordering take out and dine in for months and grimaldis does not disappoint.  only once...they gave my takeout pizza to the wrong person....christine, the manager, very generously apologized, comped my new pizza, and bought me a glass of wine as i waited.  grimaldis is a class act and has a fantastic staff with excellent food.  every time.~~#~1
"Fake" (or rather condescending) service from the "Service Manager"...and he didn't even acknowledge me when I asked the status of my car (uh, more like IGNORE). Ended every sentence with an impolite "No ma'am" or "Yes, ma'am"... ya get the scenario. Basically, the guy was a real JERK.They couldn't even figure out HOW to fix my car, even when I TOLD them what was wrong with it ( had been diagnosed at the Dealership). Two guys were sitting there staring at the computer (as if it was going to magically speak to them). At least they didn't charge me, but what a waste of time waiting for 90 minutes....~~#~0
Obligatory stop for a drink...Dodey is here so that is always good~~#~1
was i ever lucky to pick dr. karawi from a random list of doctors near my home from my insurance website.ever since i was a kid, i barely remember seeing my dentist. his hygienist came in, cleaned my teeth, then the dentist came in with his long nose hairs and big belly and bald head and stinky breath and started shoving sharp metal objects into my teeth. then he left, saying only "hmmph". he had a beach house in the cayman islands.dr karawi is exactly opposite of that (don't know if he has a house in the caymans though). what really, really, really surprised me was the karawi cleaned my teeth....the Dentist! he does that for all his patients. i asked him why, and he just said he likes to get to know his patients. how novel!he is extremely friendly and likeable but always professional. he will joke and talk to you about your vacations, plans for the weekend, etc, but then always keeps it serious when discussing your dental care. i sincerely appreciate his services and friendliness. we liked him so much, even invited him to our house warming party!so for excellent dental care and outgoing service, Dr. Karawi is your man.p.s. he's not bald, doesn't have long nose hairs or a big belly, and his breath doesn't stink.~~#~1
We have been meaning to try The Mission for awhile, and we were extremely impressed. We are self-professed foodies, good cooks, etc.Let's start with the fact that they seated us promptly at our reservation time, and that reservation had only been made that day.....surprising, because the place was packed!! Alfonso was our waiter, and he was awesome and didn't hesitate to make suggestions that we were happy to add to our dinner. First, the margaritas. ....this place knows how to pour, and they are fresh  - the only way we will drink them. Next - there are only 3 places in Phoenix that can make good table-side guacamole, and this is the best of them. Alfonso suggested a fried pork belly/cola reduction appetizer that I had to be talked into. OMG....heaven, and such a complex blend of flavors that the sweet, crunchiness of the pork belly can only be described as "worth it" if you are balking at the issue of pork belly.Entree: we chose the Chorizo Porchetta and the Scallops. Both were excellent and may I say that the timing of each course was unbelievably prompt. We never waited and yet didn't feel rushed.Dessert: I confess that I read the dessert menu first before making dinner decisions, and while other reviews loved the selections ...I wasn't blown away. The churros were small and dough-y, and the milkshake was just to heavy/sweet after a meal.....better to fill the churros with a cheese and serve them warm on dulce de leche ice cream. Fried bananas didn't excite me either. Bananas are bananas..... The pumpkin bread pudding seemed heavy and Autumn-like for a 110 degree day in Arizona and did not compliment the Latin flavors of the dinner. I feel their dessert menu needs to be expanded in a way that compliments their cuisine....some citrus sorbet, chocolate-with-red-chile cake, lime cheesecake. At any rate, I still give them the full Monty on stars!!!~~#~1
My husband took me here on a Friday night ...after hearing good things about it from coworkers.We sat on the patio which had plenty of misters and overlooked a park, it was a very relaxing environment.Our server, Carla, was as cute as could be and was so nice the entire evening. She was one of the most attentive servers that I have had in a long time. She was so genuine and really added to the experience that we had here...thank you Carla !!!We ordered a bottle of red wine that the husband picked, I am not sure what it was but it was damn good ($23 for the bottle). As an appetizer we had the Piatto Misto, which was an assortment of Italian meats, cheeses, olives , and breadsticks ($14) and this is definetly enough for 2-3 people. The meats were excellent and the cheese was tasty also. My only recommendation would be for them to not cut the cheese into tiny little cubes...that was odd because the meat was sliced and you could not incorporate it very well.For dinner we shared a pizza.. The Sofia..it had Scamorza (Smoked Mozzarella),Parma Prosciutto,Parmigiano Reggiano ($13). It was ooh soo tasty. We could not eat the whole thing...there was like 3 pieces that we ended up having boxed up.Then we had dessert.....I am still in heaven just thinking about this dessert. It was the Dolce Della Casa...Slightly Charred Sweet Calzonefilled with Chocolate Hazelnut Sauce and Banana topped with Vanilla Ice Cream...OOOOOhhh my God. This was by far the best dessert that I have had in a while. It was so gratifying...I had goosebumps after the first bite. I would recommend ordering a small and sharing it because it was huge ($7). I can die a happy woman after that dessert...and if this was a first date ...that would have been a guarantee for sex !!! The community here in Verrado was absolutely amazing, I wish I would have known about this neighborhood before I bought my house in Goodyear. If you live nearby I would recommend checking this place out and spending time looking around the  neighborhood.~~#~1
Great surprise-- I have driven by this place several times-- food was excellent-- I had the Enchantment platter-- just the right amount of heat without being overwhelming-Cool cave-like atmosphere inside and fun patio area-- I will definitely be back and bring out of towners~~#~1
I love Stinkweeds.  Owned by local commerce booster Kimber Lanning, Stinkweeds provides better selection and pricing than many national vendors.  The staff are helpful, and if they don't have what you're looking for, they'll happily special order it for you.   The parking lot is smallish, but I've never had a problem finding a space.  The central location is a big plus.  They share the plaza with other locally-owned businesses, so it makes for a fun shopping excursion.  Their listening stations are well-stocked with a variety of music, and the staff loves to talk music, as well.  They also carry a great selection of music mags, as well as some books.~~#~1
Have you ever walked into a bar or restaurant and instantly felt at home?  That's how I felt when I walked into the Grind last night.  The place has a great vibe, fantastic food and cocktails, and a friendly staff.  Some of the highlights of what we ate last night...  The burgers are phenomenal, the cable car drink was unusual and tasty, how could you not love donuts, and the bacon... oh the bacon...  I highly recommend swinging in for lunch or dinner so it become one of your favorites as it is now one of mine.~~#~1
stopped here on our way home on a road trip.  if i had known, i would've stopped on the way out, too.  the bear name drew me in (and the assumption that a diner would have chocolate malts).  the food was fantastic.  boyfriend ordered "bob's big bear burger" and it was probably the biggest hamburger i've seen in person.  apparently it was delicious (how he ate the whole thing, i will never know).  i ordered some sort of burger basket combo, featuring a much smaller cheeseburger (which was delicious), hearty portion of fries (which were ok), and the chocolate malt was only $2.99 (instead of $4.50-ish)  with the combo.  And it was one of the best chocolate malts I've ever had.  And the prices were reasonable.  And I actually loved the kitschy bear theme.  Can't wait for another trip that takes me through Phoenix (and I never thought I would say that).~~#~1
We ordered seabass and ribs. Both excellent choices. Service very good. Ambiance was unexpected. Felt like we were in hawaii with an open feel with palm trees. Used restaurant.com coupon. Great deal.~~#~1
Pita Jungle is a great place to get inexpensive Mediterranean food (as long as you don't mind a bit of a wait).The food usually gets served up really fast, but then your waiter leaves and -never comes back-.  I'm not ususally a stickler for outstanding wait service, but I do like to get my glass refilled and be given my check in a timely manner.Never-the-less, the food is so good it makes up for any other flaws.~~#~1
Been there twice now.  Great servers and the owner is a sweetheart.  I ate the Pechuga Asada and a pupusa Locoye(sp?) this time.  The chicken was made right, great beans and rice, fresh avocado,  big portions and the salsa and chips are excellent.   I live two blocks from here and I need to wake the eff up and go here more.~~#~1
super great neighborhood bookstore. it's local and not owned by the man. jimmy carter will be there signing books in febuary.  They have new and used book and something is always on sale. It's attached to wild flower and next to macs.~~#~1
I eat there about 3 times a week!! The antipasto salad and bread are addicting and can't be beat!~~#~1
I've been coming here for years...the best.  One of my favs is the lulu wings.~~#~1
This place had amazing food for reasonable prices. They have tiny card games at the tables which was pretty neat too, it keeps you busy while you wait for your food. The bar was neat, and the atmosphere was ok. I did not enjoy the music, and it was too loud to ignore. The service was pretty good, but the waitress made my friends and I uncomfortable, like we shouldn't have been there. It might have just been that one particular girl, and I would still go back. Don't dress too casual...~~#~1
I had a craving for Mexican- American type food, and since there is no longer a Chi-chi's around my friend suggested we go here since I was visiting the area from out of town. She is a frequent diner here, and loves it.  I really enjoyed my experience as well. I love a great Chimichanga along with  re-fried beans and ordered a much  needed strawberry  Margareta.  So lovely!!!! I enjoyed everything on my plate! I Loved it so much I suggested we come back my last night in town for drinks and appetizers.We decided to order the  Mini Chimi Sampler, Macayo's Famous Cheese Crisp that I ordered with ground beef (it almost looked like a cheese crisp pizza),Guacamole Dip with chips. They also offer free salsa and chips every time you arrive.Like my friend- I would be a regular here. I know when I visit my friend that she and I will go back- at my suggestion and to  her delight!~~#~1
Great place to grab a coffee with decent prices and a great atmosphere for sitting down to do some work or catch up with a friend. Would definitely recommend!~~#~1
Recently ordered Spinato's again and just had to update to 5 stars... as much as I've always loved NYPD, I have to admit that this really is the best pizza I've had in the valley. It's not fair to compare the two, as they're totally different styles, but it's just so good. And they're local. Can't beat it!~~#~1
We held a meeting planner's luncheon inviting local clients to our hotel that host regular meetings.  Our theme was "getting to the core of your meeting" and the entire event had an apple theme.  Yuri's Popcorn created a special flavor green apple for our event and it was a nice compliment to our other offerings.  Our attendees absolutely loved it and were excited about all the creative and delicious offerings, including centerpieces with an arrangement of candies and popcorn beautifully arranged into a bouquet of yumminess.Several months ago, we hosted a lemonade stand for a client serving glasses of flavored lemonade.  Yuri's created another fun flavor....lemon....that was well received by all.They offer the perfect gifts for clients and everything is very affordable when you're on a tight budget.Thank you!~~#~1
I came here at noon during spring break. When I walked in, no one was there. I rang the bell on the counter. No one came out from the back. I waited and rang the bell again. Nobody. I waited and rang the bell a third time. No one. I walked out having been unable to even find an employee much less place an order and try the food. Pathetic.~~#~0
Friendly staff and great Americanos!~~#~1
An amazing section of light bulbs for just about anything you need. Most are in stock, reasonably priced and ready to take home. I have brought in several odd bulbs that I needed to have replaced with no markings on them - They always come through like champs. Take my advice and covert your old bulbs to LED - Well worth the cost for me just to not have to replace burnt out bulbs all the time - some of my lighting is very hard to get to and Halogens are so damn hot!~~#~1
Been twice. Authentic, high quality & great price for what you get. Salsa de Chile de Arbol was the best!! Loved the decor. Orchata tasted fresh, which is a rarity in most Mexican Restaurants.~~#~1
Well I have been looking for a good barber and I have just found him. Like many other of the reviews it is very hard to find a good barber and if your looking for one go here and see Phil. I saw the other reviews on yelp and thought I would try him out. I went and got a haircut wash and an honest to goodness hot foam straight shave (hard to find now days) and it all came out wonderful. I thought the prices were in line for the area and maybe cheap for the service. 32.00 for all the services, I think it is 17 for just a haircut. I recommend anyone to go see him if you need a good cut or shave.~~#~1
After a night of debauchery with friends, my friend and I found ourselves craving a comforting bowl of Pho. I've been a regular at Cyclo's for quite sometime but decided to branch out and try something new. I was pleasantly surprised with Pho Ao Sen! I am always happy when I enter an Asian restaurant and see Asians patrons...probably sounds a little weird but to me it speaks volumes. The tranquil aesthetics of this quaint cafe made us feel welcomed and relaxed. The decor had a modern Asian feel: minimalistic organic zen with soft ambient music playing - perfect for a Sunday afternoon.We ordered the Pho Dac Biet Bo Vien- House PHO'nomenal (House special combination of *sliced eye round steak, well-done brisket, well-done flank, soft tendon, tripe, and beef meatball) and the Pho Tai (Sliced eye round steak) and Goi Cuon- Spring Rolls. As with most Vietnamese restaurants the portion size of Pho is quite large and we could have shared. Both were delicious, filling, and had a nice aroma but nothing too overpowering. I've experienced a few places that use a little too much anise, so much that you can't get an overall sense of all the delightful herbs and spices used in this delicious creation. The Spring Rolls had a very fresh crisp flavor and were the perfect accompaniment to the Pho. I give Pho Ao Sen 5 stars! Best Pho I've had in the valley, beautiful atmosphere and friendly staff makes me one happy girl! :)~~#~1
Consistent with the east coast stores, great flavor selection, friendly and accommodating staff.  The regular size doesn't look big but it is plenty for the price, not to mention the staff consistently fills above the top the cup on all products.  A much better value than Cold Stone, Baskin Robbins, and self serve froyo.~~#~1
I can't say enough wonderful things about this branch! The manager is fantastic, the other employees are happy, enthusiastic, and efficient.  Not to mention that everyone there has impeccable manners and they treat their customers as customers deserve to be treated! Go to this branch, you'll understand what I mean!~~#~1
Had the meat pizza last night and it was truly one of the best pizzas I've had in a long time.  The owner is always very welcoming and warm hearted!~~#~1
what can I say about Glam... well, i really, really despise it. Every time I go there, I regret the decision. And in my grandiose style, I'm going to say why in a list:1) Cash only!! But listen to this, the bartender will take your debit card, charge you a fee, and give you cash, which you can then use to buy drinks from the same bartender that just did the whole transaction. WHY???? 2) The location kinda blows. It's in a weird strip mall across from another strip mall. Have you ever driven by there in the day time? It's shady then, imagine at night time.3) too hipster. I feel like I am not allowed there as I work for the man, do not wear black leggings, or have razor cut bangs. I, in my mall clothing and "mainstream" style, stick out like a sore thumb.4) The music is just a little off.... ii dunno how to say what I am thinking, it's just off.Okay, the floor is fancy. That's about it.(sorry, I'm a bar snob and Glam deserves my wrath)~~#~0
Very loud, crowded and quite unpleasant. I felt very cramped and the environment was very uncomfortable.~~#~0
Great tire shop. I brought in my car because I kept losing air in a tire, they found a nail, removed it and patched the tire in 10 minutes flat. Very nice people, and very fair prices.~~#~1
Spotted Donkey Cantina is amazing!  They have delicious Mexican food, and fantastic margaritas to wash everything down with. You do have to pay for chips and salsa here, so there probably won't be any of that four bowl snacking before your main entree's come, but the medley of salsa's it comes with make it all worth it.I've tried quite a few of the dishes here, and they've all been excellent.  In no particular order are my favorites:cheddar enchilada's with hatch chiles and rice...spicy!santa fe macaroni and cheese...again- spicy!cod and shrimp tostada's- delicious!shrimp fajitasshrimp tacosAnd for dessert:fried banana wraps or the mango margarita sundae!"~~#~1
Always consistent. Great service, great carne asada and a pleasant patio on a beautiful day.~~#~1
I had a really great experience at the Havana Cafe.. Everybody there was super nice and the service was great... I don't think our water glasses ever got to less than 1/2 full. The food was excellent. Price-wise it was a little more than we expected, but totally worth it. The sangria and drinks were kind of pricey, but ah well. Overall a very good experience- we will be back!~~#~1
I enjoy falafels and my boyfriend really likes Gyros.  So, when we received a coupon for Daphne's Greek Café we were jazzed to go check it out.What I noticed right away is it has kind of a fast-food sort of feel to it and I thought, OK, its catering to people on their lunch breaks.  However, the food itself is like Greek fast food for people who have never had anywhere near really Greek food before and so they wouldn't know any better.The plates are astatically pleasing with everything arranged nice and neat.  This amounted to zilch to me.  When I got to eat, I want plenty of food and I want quality as appropriately expected from the type of establishment I am eating at.  At Daphne's you get a few little thin slices of what may or may not be real gyro meat.  The falafel meat is little over fried disks.  That's right disks.  Not balls of falafel meat where the outside is slightly crunchy and the inside is meaty and moist.  The pita bread is not.  It's just some flat bread cut into little triangles.  The tzatziki sauce is ... what the heck is this stuff in this little 1 inch paper cup?  The vegetables were fresh.There is more to complain about with this place, but you get the picture.  I'm thinking that anyone who likes it here just doesn't know what real Greek food is like.~~#~0
Gourmet markets, to me, are like candy shops to a sugar freak. "Hello, my name is Thomas. And I am a FoodAholic." There I said it. Do you feel better. Huh? Oh. Sorry. Didn't mean to get so defensive. But how can you defend AJ's? How? How I ask you? Ok, so it's REALLY expensive. And, yes, they should provide a blood donor center at the entrance to give cash on the spot for shoppers plasma. I HATE huge markets. Fry's too big. Safeway just right. AJ's just right and then some. The produce section is perfection. Not mounds and mounds of produce you know is wrinkling and rotting more than Bea Arthur in season 6 of the Golden Girls. Cute little baskets hold just enough fruit and veggies to select from and not too much where you know it's all riddled with germs and spiddle. The meats and cheeses? Oh, my! The filet (at a whopping $34.99 a pound) is worth every bite. Of course it'll be a year or so when I would pay that much again. Hello? Blood donation station idea! The ready made food is dee lish...curry chicken salad and brocolli delight to name two. Yes, it' s called brocolli delight. My gay ass did not name it. I would have called it beautiful broccoli. Just rolls off the tongue better. I've never had a cart wobble...see Fry's review...they ride smooth and apparently are good for the enviornment. Flowers, baked goods, dishes....AJ's. It's here. I'm queer. Get used to it.~~#~1
This place is fantastic.About the restaurant itself.  It's right by downtown Phoenix, and in fact right next to a Light Rail stop--so keep this in mind, parking is metered and sometimes hard to come by easily, if you live by a light rail this may be the smarter option.  The place is seriously tiny, only about 6-8 groups of people can be seated at one time.  A slight drawback is that there is limited outdoor seating, which, given the predictably large lines even on weekdays, is a problem.  The Phoenix sun will make a 45 minute wait seem like an hour and a half wait.Now about the service.  I've always had a good experience with the people who work here.  The first time I came here, apparently one of the owners saw that I looked lost, because she came out and very kindly explained how people are seated, where I can go to get coffee in the meantime.  She even suggested I leave my cell phone number and she'll call me when my seat is ready, in case I'm shopping for example.  The waitresses always serve us quickly and never leave us hanging, and they're always smiling, which for some reason makes the experience so much better.Now for the best part.  I swear, they put crack in their food, because although their breakfast options are simple, they are out of this world.  The first time I came here I got the waffles.  Perhaps it's because they use REAL maple syrup, or all of the ingredients are organic and locally grown, but they make the best waffles I've ever had.  I don't even know how one makes a good waffle really, it seems pretty formulaic, but it's stellar.  I ordered it with bacon, which was also wonderful--the bacon used was the good stuff, not the excessively fatty bacon you buy at the supermarket.  Every bite is spectacular, and when you're done, you're full, but not the kind of full you'll often get at breakfast joints where you think you're going to explode or take a nap--full, but refreshed.The second time I came I got the pancakes.  Not the best pancake I've ever had, but still, superb and the real maple syrup just sends it through the roof.  The third time I went I got the waffle again (see above).Before I came here, I was excited about leaving Phoenix for New York due to the incredible array of dining options you get in that city.  Now I'm worried there won't be anything as good!~~#~1
I will continue to give this place five stars for so many reasons.  First, the menu is very creative, and offers a great variety of healthy food, with an Asian twist.  This time I had the shrimp curry, which had lots of fresh vegetables, and instead of a heavy cream curry, it was a much healthier broth curry.  We had the edamame dumplings again, which were as good as I remembered.  It was kind of cool to see Dr. Weil eating there last night.  It's good to know that he likes the place enough to dine there.~~#~1
We used the taco cart for my 30th birthday this past weekend and we came away very impressed. Eduardo was the guy that came to our fiesta, and he was incredible. When he arrived, we experienced a haboob and he immediately stepped in and helped bring in our decorations and furniture. He waited about 30 minutes until serving because we were unsure if the haboob was going to attack again. My wife and I are both in the restaurant biz and so were many of the guests, we all came away impressed with the food quality. Next time we throw a party, we will use them again! Make sure to get the el pastor and carnitas. Great job Hector & Eduardo.~~#~1
I came to Timo for my birthday last week after hearing rave reviews about it from a few friends of mine. I met up with the fabulous Jennifer T. and I was so happy to check this place out!I like any place that I get to walk in through a back door. I passed through the very chill looking patio area first, another plus in my book. Plenty of outdoor seating that looked dangerously inviting once this hot hot heat cools off. Inside was intimate, but with the large windows, it wasn't dark and depressing. Like your own little happy wine bar world.They have an amazing wood burning oven. Normally, that itself is plenty good enough, but then there's the food that comes out of that wonderful oven. I only tried the spinach and artichoke dip, which was the best I have ever had! It didn't have a pool of oil (first time for everything!), it was so fresh, and I really appreciated seeing the bread sliced fresh right in front of us, since we were sitting at the bar. I saw several other things (flatbread)  come out of that oven, and I will have to go back to try them! Everything smelled delicious and was presented with a touch of class without being pretentious. I was also very intrigued by the eggplant dip which is apparently "better than baba!" Now for the drinks. Holy cow. I've been drinking a few years now, so safe to say, I've tried many, many drinks. Or so I thought. Coconut mojito anyone!? Made with Ciroc Coconut vodka!  As tasty as mojitos are, I don't get a long well with rum, so vodka was a pleasant surprise, and the coconut just brought the mmmmmazing factor to a whole new level. I also tried the white sangria, another 5 stars. Great wine list too- Apothic Red is one of a few reds I like, and they have it!  The staff was top notch as well. I arrived shortly before a shift change, and both bartenders were personable and hard working, and truly seemed to enjoy what they were doing. I'm pretty bad with names unfortunately, or I would love to mention them.I can't wait to go back! For drinks and food! I think I'd even go alone for lunch if I didn't have any company!~~#~1
Joe's is truly a special place!! What makes this place so awesome is that you literally feel like you stepped back into an American farmhouse situated somewhere in the 1940's. The employees are fully compitent in their abilities and they seem happy to work there. They have homemade root beer, which is very tasty and leaves a smooth and flavorful aftertaste. They also serve Barq's Red Cream soda from tap, which is impossible to find anywhere in the southwest. The outdoor dining area has benches in a picnic style setting, while the indoor dining area features a vintage John Deere tractor as the center piece. The side dishes are kind of small (one scoop), so you might want to opt for and extra side...the mac and cheese rocks!! I also recommend getting cornbread or lemon cake for desert!!~~#~1
I don't intend to return, but based on the way we were treated by the kitchen earlier this week, my "uncouth" self doesn't exactly feel welcome anyway. However, I'm not quite convinced that it's my loss... It had been almost a year since my original visit to Breadfruit which did not overwhelm (as you can judge by it taking me a year to make it back) but I did have an appreciation of the option for Caribbean cuisine. Since a friend and I were going to be downtown for an event, I suggested Breadfruit for our dinner spot. We enjoy good food and supporting local. The option to pick up wine at the Public Market next door and have the already reasonable corkage fee waived was a bonus, as we had really enjoyed a couple of the Arizona Stronghold wines at a recent FnB wine pairing and thought they would pair well with the Jamaican heat! While the scallops were delicious and cooked perfectly, 2 for $12.50 -- $6.25 per scallop -- is a tad steep in my book. We also shared the Jerk Chicken Salad ($9.95) and the Jerk Prawns Off the Grill ($14.95). Here's the ultimate rub, the bottom of the menu states "no substitutions or modifications"... Since when is cutting a KFC-side-sized ear of corn a "modification"? At the same time, the menu describes the restaurant and it's offerings as "Nothing fancy; simply good food that nourishes and rejuvenates the body." It seems like cutting something in half so we could easily share it -- particularly after the plate has been delivered to the table for us to appreciate it's "beauty" AND after we've communicated to our server and demonstrated with the first two courses that we were splitting the items -- is in the vein of "nothing fancy." How about providing the customer with an appropriate utensil to cut it themselves, then? The fact that the chef was obstinate in refusing to cut the KFC-side-sized ear of corn provided with our entree screams "pretentious and grandiose" and tainted our entire experience. To quote my dinning companion, "You are not James Beard and James Beard would've cut the corn!"~~#~0
Pita Jungle is a staple favorite of mine and my boyfriend's. Healthy, hearty and great service. It's too bad that a lot of their prices have gone up (as have other restaurants) but I'll still patronize this place. Read as: some things went up in price almost two dollars, but you can still have a meal and a drink for around $10, more or less, depending on what you order. I definitely like this place over the new one across MCC on Southern - there's something about being by the lake that makes it special. Even if there are stinky ducks there from time to time. ;)Ooh - and the gambas con ajos is my favorite appetizer! :)~~#~1
This is my parents' favorite place to eat when they come to Phoenix so we dropped by twice on our family vacation. The owner/proprietress convinced my mom (in mandarin) to let her pick the dishes for our first dinner so we didn't even know what would be coming. The cold smoked duck was sooo delish as was the special mountain leafy green with bean curd shreds (all minced fine and not on the regular menu). There was also a shredded pork dish with bamboo (excellent) and a pickled vegetable with fish soup. The soup wasn't really my thing because it was heavily seasoned with white pepper which I hate but the rest of my family said it was exceptional.Our second visit was for lunch before heading off to the airport for the return trip. I could have eaten the entire scallion pancake myself as well as the cold spicy pork belly dish. Luckily, we ordered two orders of fried potstickers because those were delicious as well. We also had some tasty steamed pork buns but I was stuffed at that point.If you really want to experience authentic shanghai food, let the staff order for you, you won't regret it.~~#~1
I haven't written a review in ages, but this place is SO GOOD that I'd be ashamed of myself if I didn't review it.I am the most hyberbolic person in the whole world in the history of time, but this time, when I say that it was the best pancakes I've ever had, I'm not kidding.  Just insanely delicious.  Scrambled eggs were also some of the best I've had (and come on, they're scrambled eggs, so you don't expect that much variety), and the breakfast potatoes were very good.  I couldn't pinpoint the seasoning, but it's different than you usually get.Coffee:  Yum.  I don't think I'd even heard of Arbuckle's, but apparently it's got a great reputation, and deservedly so.The owner Joe stopped by our table, and was super nice and genuine.  Service was just fine too.I'm sure Joe's will get a reputation and huge following soon, so believe the hype and check it out.~~#~1
My boyfriend and I tried this place last year and we haven't been back since. The food was really unspectacular, they weren't really that hot. The price is a bit high since there's a restaurant by the same name on Southern and Dobson that serve much better food for less. The decor was really tacky and they should paint over the mural, it does not appeal to their clientele. Lastly, the staff was not nice.~~#~0
Fast service, the woman who did my hair was great and it was the cheapest hair cut I've ever gotten. I was told that my hair cut looked better than when I was paying $200+~~#~1
My husband and I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. Every time we drive by he wants to go in and eat. Even if we are driving home from a dinner we just had!! 1. The people that work there are AMAZING. They are so nice and hospitable, always glad to see you and let you decide the type of dining experience you want. (romantic date, take out, quick bar eats, etc.) 2. This is the freshest place for seafood I have found in Phoenix. I don't know how they find half of the stuff the serve, but they do, and it is just off the boat. (I lived in Boston for 3 years and they get stuff I crave, like Kumomato Oysters, all types of fish and meat from East Coast farms) 3. Pricing is right on...since they are serving stuff that is difficult to procure, I am always amazed at the value they present. Keep Rocking Yasu!!!~~#~1
The salad plates were not chilled... As they usually are it however is a busy night but something's are expected at the olive garden... The food tasted like it was under a hot lamp for so long it tasted almost hard and also under cooked for the seafood... Not a great experience at the olive garden there are certain things expected... The expectations are not that high shouldnt be that hard to do....~~#~0
When people feel a cold coming, they pop a zinc lozenge or tablet to boost the immune system. I have a much better way to get my zinc supplementation: I head over to Pier 83 for their terrific fried oysters. With the first crunchy bite I begin to feel so much better. Placebo effect, probably. But hey ... as long as I get that feel-good boost, I don't care. The fish and chips are also the best I've had in the Valley. And to think that I've previously been trying to get my fish 'n chips fix from the likes of Pete's ... yikes! And their clam chowder is delicious; I don't need to feel under the weather to have an excuse for ordering this tasty bowl of comfort. The friendly staff and comfortable informal atmosphere complete the enticement for many return visits.~~#~1
I always have customer service problems with Fedex.  How the heck did they get to be so big with the crappy way they treat customers?  I use the Internet a lot for purchases and about 60% of the time, they screwed-up and then their customer service has major difficulty fixing the problems.  I have asked for shipments to be held at the closet shipping location to my office and they ship to my home.  Another time I asked for the same thing and they held it at the regional depot instead of where I asked that it be sent.  I can go on and on about the screw-ups I have experienced with Fedex.  But this time they really pissed me off.  I get a harassing phone calls from a collection agency that says they have been contracted by Fedex to collect an overdue bill from me in the amount of $4000+.  I have asked them for details and all I get is harassment.  So I asked Fedex for help and customer service told me to contact Fedex Revenue Services, which I did.  I told them that I am getting harassing phone calls from XYZ collection agency and the person who keeps calling is named Chris.  I also tell them that the alleged amount owed is $4000+ and the account is supposedly in my name.  So I ask that they investigate and tell me if I indeed have an overdue account in my name for this amount.  (I know I do not have such an account!).  Fedex then tells me that they cannot help me because I have not provided enough information.  WTF?  How much more information can I provide?  Do they want my height and weight?  Maybe my blood type?  Maybe I have to provide the names and birth dates of my children too?This is why I say that Fedex really blows!~~#~0
I was given a $100 gift card to use at Willow Stream Spa last December... I've been waiting for the perfect day to use it since then.  Well, guess what? Today was that day!With my fiance out of town for the weekend, I took advantage of some much deserved "Gabi time" as I like to call my downtime.  I called a few days ago to make an appointment and I asked if there were any specials going on.  Lucky for me, there were several!  The one that was most appealing to me was the "book any 60 or 90 minute treatment and get a complimentary 30 minute treatment to go with it."  I chose to book a 60 minute aromatherapy facial and a 30 minute complimentary massage to go with it... I was in heaven!I'll back up a moment and just say that I've been to the Willow Stream Spa before... years ago.  Today was even more heavenly than I remembered.  I checked in around noon and didn't leave until after 6pm.  I could've stayed longer, but I had to come home to take Minnie out!The Willow Stream facility is gorgeous and includes every amenity you can imagine... I started out in the fitness room for a quick workout and then took a glorious shower before my massage and facial.  I had Tomi for my massage and she focused on my neck, back, and shoulders... (I've been having shoulder pain so I think she customized this based on my situation).  She was fantastic but with just 30 minutes, it felt like a tease... my facial made it all worthwhile though- it was pure bliss!  Heather was my esthetician and did a fabulous job.  I highly recommend her - she explained every product she was using as I fell in and out of a relaxing sleep while she not only worked on my face but my shoulders, chest, neck, scalp, hands and feet... the products felt amazing and smelled good too.  So much so that I bought a couple on my way out.  After my services, I had lunch (a delicious salad with veggies and chicken) while I wrote some thank you notes and read my book... It was so peaceful.  It was like an escape from the world and I enjoyed every second of it!So, bottom line - if you are thinking about getting a spa-lover like me a gift anytime soon, Willow Stream Spa giftcards are always welcome... what an experience!  I'm feeling energized, relaxed, and peaceful.~~#~1
I am *floored* that this place has 4 stars. Literally fell out of my chair, picked myself up, then continued on to write my review. The staff is friendly at this restaurant - I'll give them that. It's relatively clean and has decent prices. That's where any positives end. The food here is absolutely disgusting. Nothing has any flavour - no flavour at all. None. Nada. The salsa is peppery water at best, the beans are mush, and the rice just tastes like plain white rice. I had a ground beef burrito, which I'd think would be difficult to mess up... Nope. Not for these guys. The beef itself was unseasoned burnt 80/20 ground beef. There was at least 3lbs of sour cream. And for God's sake -- even the "cheese mixture" had zero flavour. I've eaten better pizza boxes. Pass on this places, dudes.~~#~0
Very friendly staff, cute decor! Small, but don't let that fool you, best sandwiches ever!! The egg salad sandwich was so good, it reminded me of the egg salad I enjoyed as a kid! Their potato salad is made there and soo yummy!! Talked to the owner and she was very nice.~~#~1
HA HAHAHAHAHA! "Pit" is right.... man, this place would have been a terrible idea if i wasn't already expecting lameness.now occupying the space that has seen the death of not one, but two dance club (411 and Level), Peach Pit Afterdark.... I mean Cherry Lounge and Pit is beyond ghetto.opened by the same people who do sugar daddy's and dos gringos, this place has all the sexiness and allure of a Trails commercial. You know? I was half expecting to turn a corner to see a neon colored bikini-clad bleached blonde on top of a motor boat. well, they've updated the look of the cage-trapped go-go dancers to mini panties with knee-high dragon rider boots with fuzzy muppet skins adorning them.the vids of drunken lounge-goers (a la daddy's and now dos) playing in tiny screens on the walls in hallways and behind bars in tact, interspersed with footage of seriously hagard looking chics doing "sexy" things like sucking on lollipops, cherries, winking (yes, she was winking right at you, wasn't she? inviting you in to her red-drenched lair to bask in the glow of a alcohol doused club circa 1992).i'm not sure what the DRESS CODE we were so violently and largely reminded of in line, but the girl in front of me had on an oversized T-shirt, baggy jeans and flip flops (?) and they took her $5 and let her in no problem. i also saw a girl dressed exactly like peggy bundy...no joke, spandex black calf leggings, long spandwex shirt in orange, heels and a giant boob belt. it was so incredible i took a picture. she was not impressed with my observation, so i had to sneak the photo.anyway.... take it for what it is, a club owned by dos gringos guys on mill ave.~~#~0
i love this place and eat there every time I'm in the area.  Pizza, pasta, appetizers all fantastic.  Plan to spend some time waiting for a table.  We always have fun just eating at the bar.  Yumm~~#~1
This is an awesome family owned business. We've had consistently fresh and delicious food each time we've been here. They homemake things like their ranch dressing to take them to a different level than other places. Highly recommend this place. Prices are not bad either.~~#~1
When cowboys ride off into the sunset, they probably stop at Greasewood Flat for a burger and beer. This rustic little bar is located a bit outside the city right near Pinnacle Peak and is definitely worth the drive! You'll know you are in the right spot when you see the antique farm equipment and suddenly feel like you are walking up to an Old West saloon. Say hello to the mule on your way in. Outside they have picnic tables, horseshoes, and fire pits (gets chilly out there in the desert!), and on the weekends they have live music and dancing. Inside, the bar is pretty small, and the place is covered in dollar bills and business cards left by satisfied cowboys and cowgals. For the nights without live music, don't you fret, they have a jukebox with tons of country hits. The night we went it was the bartender's birthday, and the regulars were definitely having a good time.  Both a historic landmark (120+-year old original stagecoach stop) and a dive bar, Greasewood Flat is clearly special to Arizona, and is a definite must see. I'll be going back on a weekend to get the true Greasewood Flat experience and hopefully see a cute cowboy or two..~~#~1
Full disclosure: one way or another, I have only been to Roaring Fork for the Happy Hour, but the happy hour is darn good. You can, and you should, get that kettle of green chili pork or the big-ass burger, or better yet, share the two with someone nice. The huckleberry margarita is so good, I've had three in one sitting (no, I wasn't driving!). I fully intend to get over there for dinner soon, because I keep seeing the sugar cured duck on the menu and just thinking about it right now my mouth is watering. It gets pretty busy during the happy hour, though, so be prepared to wait a little if your party is large.~~#~1
i love the $5 happy hours. all the dishes are a great value and delicious!~~#~1
It's high time I wrote a review for Desert Jade. I grew up on their food. So many amazing family memories were created here so it's tough for me to go anywhere else and be quite as happy. The owners know my family and are always ready with a hug. This is truly a real-deal Phoenix institution. I have so many favorite items but here are few must-tries: chicken lettuce wraps (I'd been eating these here looooong before so-called "fusion" joints like PF Chang's had them on their menu), sizzling rice chicken, sesame chicken, Desert Jade chow mein, honey-dipped chicken wings, any one of their delicious soups. So much to choose from and it's all done exceedingly well with true consistency. Support a local, family-run joint for truly fabulous Chinese food!~~#~1
I wish that this place were not so good - I have not been able to drink the coffee at my office in weeks.  The location that One Coffee occupies used to be a coffee shop graveyard.  Several coffee houses went out of business in this location, unable to compete with Starbucks.  One Coffee has bucked that trend and it is not hard to see why.  One Coffee has great coffee and it is amazingly consistent.  The staff is always friendly.  This place is certainly doing something right; everytime I go in there it has more and more customers.~~#~1
I bought a deal off of Living Social and waited a while to call them, figuring they'd be swamped with business. Now I can't get them to call me back so I can use my deal. (NOTE: There were no reviews of this company on Yelp BEFORE the Living Social deal.) Of course, Living Social is no help - their website says I need to call a consumer advocate in my area. This kind of thing, I predict, will be the demise of every deal-of-the-day site: the company selling the deal bears no risk of having to pay refunds if the business providing the goods or services doesn't perform. I have since cancelled my subscriptions to EVERY deal-of-the-day email out there. Lesson learned about TWO companies with no ethics.~~#~0
The Duce is a disaster. As an Arizona native and a downtown local I root for cool interesting places downtown. I wanted to love this place. The 1st time we tried the Duce I was extremely let down by the customer service. The parking is atrocious. It's as if you are inconveniencing the staff by asking where you order food. They were out of just about everything we wanted to order. So disappointing. However I decided to give them a second shot. Everyone has a rough night. We went to an event there last night the entertainment by Scandalesque was AMAZING... same TERRIBLE customer service from the staff at the Duce. Management needs to wake up. Great concept. Horrific customer service and staff.~~#~0
NOTE: Ignore the reviews above. It looks as if there is some deliberate attempt by the Udupai owners to pose as members and bash this place. Yes, this owner used to own Udupai Cafe and Udupai Cafe is another dosa house that competes with this eatery.  If you read my other reviews, you know that I'm critical and  my attention to detail is there so I'm not one of these people who likes every place he eats at.PositivesI'm Indian and I can assure you this place is good. I have never been to Udupai Cafe but based on its failing health inspections, I would be scared to eat there. Woodlands is a nice CLEAN eatery in a nice part of Chandler.  It's not a restaurant.  It's basically a Dosa shop. They  specialize in Dosa and offer several types. They also have excellent Indian Chinese dishes.   The food is consistently good and I have eaten there on several occassions.  This is a lunch/light dinner place.  Don't think of this place like a restaurant.  There are several types of Dosa and that's what this place specializes in.  The restaurant is also modern and not is some ghetto strip mall so don't worry about failing health codes here...at least not for a while.NegativesTheir non-South Indian dishes are not so good. For non-Indians, they should be informed that this is a Dosa house so order dosa and other south Indian dishes.  Don't order your typical Indian restaurant favorites like palak paneer (it wasn't good here).   The owner also says every dish is excellent which isn't true; he is kind of a businessman so he doesn't really care about telling you which dishes stand out.  Stick to the Dosa and the Vegetable Manchurian.  Their mango shake wasn't very good. Their chiku shake is great.~~#~1
Mail Call is a full service shipping store. The owners are great-they are friendly and accommodating. I purchase shipping supplies from them are their prices are very fair, much less than a larger place up in the airpark. They take care all of my local needs and get the job done. Kudos to Mail Call!~~#~1
I love the other locations of Thai Rama and this one is no exception! Food is fast, fresh tasting and well seasoned. The lunch specials are unique and delicious, and the service is good. Far superior to the Char's Thai restaurant that used to be in the same location.~~#~1
This is a great place in an extremity of the Valley. They serve both Korean and Japanese food. They are quick and attentive. Having lived in South Korea for two years, I can honestly admit that this is some of the most authentic Korean cuisine I've had in Phoenix. I typically ate bibimbap once a week minimum over there and I can't really tell the difference between Takamatsu's version and the stuff I had on the other side of the Pacific. I noticed they offer a list of other, more obscure foods I learned to love over there, including naengmyeon (cold, spicy noodles), japchae (stir-fried glass noodles), and several other dishes. They also follow tradition and bring you several side dishes. Love it or hate it, kimchi accompanies every meal, as do spicy bean sprouts, a tangy spinach dish and a few other random sides. It's a little bit more expensive than average restaurant prices in the Valley, but definitely worth it when you consider the sides that come with it, and a complimentary spiced tea for "dessert."~~#~1
Dr. Pierrend is ok, he will write prescriptions for about anything without really investigating if the are needed but he seems like a nice guy. The staff are horrible. They tried to charge me 2 times for lab results which are covered by my insurance. Refused to give me the results without billing insurance for an office visit. I would not recommend this medical provider to anyone. Everyone in my family has gone to PMG and has a bad story to tell. If you are smart you will look elsewhere for medical help~~#~0
Fabulous place to get wine, beer, spirits.  It also has amazing keg selection.~~#~1
Best bruschetta I have had here. Good wine selection as well.My favorite bruschetta are:-smoked prosciutto, fig, mascarpone, truffle oil-roasted chicken, sundried tomatoes, goat cheese-pulled pork, housemade pesto, roasted red pepper-mozz, basil, roma tomato, qc olive oil & balsamic~~#~1
If you want Cheap go to Walmart! But if you want authentic eclectic trinkets that you will proudly own and showcase in your home this is the place for you!~~#~1
Very unpleasant experience. Creepy male doctor. Uncaring. And no help.I went to this Urgent Care with a swollen ankle so painful that I was nauseous, dizzy and having vision problems. The doctor interrogated me and advised me to get my head examined. I'm not kidding. Mom was right: good doctors don't advertise. This place actually solicits Yelp reviews.~~#~0
Huge Fan of this place. People in the food industry should take a lesson from these guys as they have great customer service. Huge fan of the sandwiches.~~#~1
My daughter and I got a recommendation from our nail tech at Scottsdale nails. WE LOVE VIETNAMESE FOOD and I was so glad to find this place. It is as good as what I used to get in Oakland, CA. The location is a little strange but once you are inside the interior is nice and tranquil and the service is very friendly. We enjoyed our noodle soup and spring rolls and we will be back for more!~~#~1
I have been attending Az Combat for the past 9 years and the instructors are fantastic. They teach Kickboxing, Jui-jitsu and MMA classes. Az Combat was one of the very first MMA Gyms in Arizona and have a great reputation as one of the top 10 training gyms in the nation. My daughter has also been at this school for the same amount of time and has taken advantage of many of the classes they offer including their boot camp. I would highly recommend this gym for beginners and the advanced  looking to break into the MMA circle. They have produced some of the top named fighters in Arizona.~~#~1
Delux is always really good, fresh, and it's a clean place too! I love the beet salad with chicken added. It's delish! My man digs the burgers and we both scarf the sweet potato fries. Love their dipping sauce that comes next to the ketchup, Ah-mazing!~~#~1
ZERO stars!I traveled from STL to SFO a few weeks ago (with a layover in PHX). I have a couple complaints;One, I was checking 2 pieces of luggage in STL. One ended up being 14lbs. over weight (it was a cooler with food I bring home each year from my dad). I was charged an additional $90 on top of the $35 initially for the cooler to ship (including the $25 for my first bag- so $150 total)! This is an OUTRAGEOUS additional charge! I thought overweight bags were charged an additional $25 like other airlines I've had to pay at but $120 to ship one bag is just insane (and a set price for overweight bags is NOT listed on your website)! On top of that I paid $250 for a pet ticket so my baggage fees were $400 total... $100 more than my round trip ticket to fly. I couldn't believe that!On another note, the woman agent helping me at STL was the most rude customer service agent I've ever dealt with anywhere! She was rude to me about the overweight baggage and then claimed my dog was too tall to fit in her carrier so she claimed she wouldn't allow her to fly. She raised he voice at me and called me "a very inhumane person" for making a dog ride like that for a whole flight; seriously making me cry. I fly all over the country to do shows with my dog and this has never been a problem, including on the first leg of my trip when I bought the round trip dog ticket in SFO. This woman name-calling was totally inappropriate... people in line beside me were astonished. Since I had my round trip dog ticket purchased already, and she was sick of fighting with me over it, she let me go but told me the gate person probably wouldn't let me on the flight (and of course the gate person did).Between the dog crate episode and the bags, I have never been treated so poorly and charged with such ridiculously high adage fees. I'm very disappointed to not be able to fly US Air anymore since I never had problems with them in the past. It was a horrible way to end a very nice holiday vacation.I have passed the word on to as many people and websites as possible not to fly this airline!~~#~0
Bad... food was horrible... do not waste your time or money~~#~0
Thinking about splurging on a home theater?  Ask for Scott.  He will listen to you and help you build your dream system within your budget.  He will even respond to your hi-fi emergencies (eg. the guests are arriving for your Super Bowl party and you don't remember how to work the mission control style remote).~~#~1

I have been looking for a great therapist for a long time.  Someone that takes the time to read my body, to see the synergy of the muscles and be able to do the work.  Finally, I found Robert.  He has been an LMT for more than 15 years in the Valley and continues to educated himself often.  His studio is located conveniently just off of the 51 about 10 minutes in a quiet residential neighborhood.The massage intake questioning was thorough, but not invasive.  His set up is calming and the room & table were warmed by a heater!  The massage lasted 90 minutes or so, I didn't want to go back to the real world.  He does offer Gift Certificates and has Pay Pal set up on his website if you didn't plan ahead with stopping for cash.  I will definitely visit him again when I need the work!~~#~1
Just tried this place this afternoon. Very friendly staff & great rates with no commitments. You don't need to worry about paying some $25-$40 co pay like at a regular Chiropractic's office each time you visit. It's $49 a month and you get four visits a month. It's not like massage envy where you have to sign a contract for a year and its hard to quit. This goes month to month. Try it out once for $19 if you want. This company is really growing. So stop by and see for yourself!!~~#~1
We ordered $40 worth of pizza for takeout and it took almost 2 hours -- was told 20 minutes. We were not comp'd for anything. When I expressed my dissatisfaction, they offered to give me $40 credit toward my next order. I asked for this in writing, and they gave me the "we can't provide it in writing -- we wrote your name down and have you on record" line.Guess what -- I called back a couple months later and they had no record. They refused to honor the credit....and were rude. I asked to speak to the owner, and was told "he's out of town." The pizza is mediocre at best. I have zero tolerance for businesses such as this. PLEASE spend your money somewhere else that deserves to be patronized.~~#~0
By far the best taco shop in the valley. Their rolled tacos are delicious. I've had them dozens of time and they never disappoint. The restaurant is older and what you'd expect of a normal "taco shop", but it is very clean and the staff is always very friendly. They also have the best red hot sauce I've tasted yet. Yuuuuuuum.~~#~1
I am impressed! I finally got a chance to check out the MIM yesterday and I was really wowed by the extensive collection. I knew going in to expect items from all over the world, but there are literally instruments and related objects from every country. We spent between two and two and a half hours but it still wasn't enough time to really take in everything.I loved that the audio/video guide was included in the $15 admission price. Most museums I have been to charge an additional fee. This was unlike any guide I have experienced before. No numbers to punch in, just walk by any of the exhibits with your headset on and when you stop at each video screen, the audio automatically starts up! Very cool, and I loved watching all the videos to learn more about all the instruments. When I walked up to the flamenco part of the Spain exhibit I instantly recognized the video playing as I have actually been in the flamenco club in Madrid where it was filmed so I thought that was neat.I really enjoyed all of the exhibits especially seeing the "guts" of the Steinway piano and how Martin guitars are made. It's not something I had thought about much before but now I know so much! I think the MIM is a fab place to take kids (and adults!) to learn and to get them excited about music. Definitely check it out it you haven't yet.Edited to add: If you are a Bank of America card holder, you can get into the MIM for free the first full weekend of each month in 2011.~~#~1
I really like this place... Taking the advice of Yelp we stopped in on our way through downtown. We were immediately greeted as we walked in. I told the staff it was our first time in and asked which sandwich was the best. Following the recommendation I ordered the Crackerjack, cracked pepper turkey and melted pepper jack cheese with lettuce, tomato, onion and Russian dressing. We also ordered the Godfather, cappicola, salami, pepperoni and melted mozzarella on garlic toasted bread. Let's take a moment and show the bread some much deserved love. It tastes fresh with a chewy center and crisp exterior covered in sesame seeds. You could put a shoe on this bread and it would taste great. I really enjoyed the Crackerjack. The Godfather was good for a few bites, but too rich for me. I can't wait to come back... Great choice for lunch downtown for a very fair price. Unless you are completely starving, share a sandwich!~~#~1
Pros: -No breed restrictions on dogs-Washer and dryer in unitCons: -Awful and idiotic leasing staff. Forms will be missing or prepared incorrectly.-Rude and inadequate maintenance (be prepared to supply your own tools half of the time)-Trash divers daily that no one does anything about-No on-site security (you can call after 9 pm for a "courtesy patrol" but it takes them hours to arrive) and the front gate is NEVER closed-Vandalized cars -A MURDER (this was the location of the man who set his pregnant girl friend on fire)-The main pool is beautifully maintained and clean. The 3 other pools are small, dirty, and frequently closed. -Bug infestations in most apartments-Dogs kept on patios 24/7 (a clear violation of the lease) so their barking can be heard by all-The basketball court and tennis courts are never available, as they are constantly used by kids to bike ride on with the encouragement of the apartment staff-Tons of potholes! Driving through the parking lot requires excellent shocks and there is minimal guest parking-The apartments have less insulation than a cardboard box. Freezing in the winter, sweltering in the summer. Nothing is fitted correctly to it's frame, either. If you can afford a better place, I highly reccommend it.~~#~0
Best noodles in Phoenix. This place is hands down the best chinese food in Phoenix. PF Changes has nothing on these guys, they are fast, friendly and food is hot. Its also excellent for leftovers too.~~#~1
Have been in twice since my last review. Its a like a COMPLETELY new atmosphere!! And sorry to say this is not in a good way. Service was terrible and I was emberassed that I actually brought some new people with me to try it out. Just went for this saturdays last ufc fight! They were like natzi's with the seating you have to have 75% of your party with you to get a seat even though my boys were parking and in the parking lot they gave our table away so after getting the tenth degree abou there seating rules we were finally sat all had to sit speraticly through out the bar. We should've just turned around right then but decided to stay... then on top of that we were sat next to some drunk beligerent people spilling and flirting with there server (wich you could tell made her uncomfotable) that table were continuosly getting over served beers. Since there was not one mgr in sight the little time we were one of my boys stepped in and there was almost a fight right then and there.. putting that aside our service was horrible some dude was our server and we went without seeing him for like 30 min and not so cold beers. At that point after one round of drinks we decided not to order food and the table next to us was gripeing about there food so that was another sign to get the F out of there so we paid (once the server got back) then bolted. I wasn't going to yelp anything BUT I just received my checking statement and the dude added 5 to his 3 dollar tip. I gave the guy 3 on $12 he was lucky to have even gotten that. I'm going to find out the guys name and go to upper mgmt because this is not the first time i've heard of this happening there. With that said.. I WILL NEVER BE BACK HERE AGAIN! This place has gone down hill!! . DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE !! Very disappointed~~#~0
Hands down the best middle eastern restaurant in the Tempe area.  You can't beat the prices, everything is always consistently good (we go here about once a week).Favorites: Hummus and Gyro Delux!Don't forget to grab some baklava too, this is the best i've ever had (and that includes having some while in the middle east)~~#~1
Primp and Blow at the Waterfront is divine! I walked out feeling like a Super Model without spending a fortune! Great Stylists. Upbeat Friendly atmosphere. Great Tunes and an overall GREAT VIBE!  Convenient Parking and centrally located right near Fashion Square and Olive and Ivy. LOVE it!~~#~1
My sister and I went here the other week and got gel manicures! They turned out beautiful and lasted forever! Ithink Biagio is now my go to nail salon! Keep it up!~~#~1
If you are over 24 you are too old to be here.  First, this place has beer.  Don't order mixed drinks, don't order wine, both are gross unless your sole purpose is to get trashed, which is the mission of every underage and young, young 20-something at this bar.This is the place you'd go to with your fake ID because when you're 19 this is what you think a bar should be.Expect people over drinking and throwing up very early on in the evening in the bathroom.~~#~0
I had high hopes for this place, and it is really too bad because I love to support the Phoenix area restaurants, especially a Caribbean one and I had already been to the adjoining Rum Bar and loved the drinks, but the food was bad.  It was not only bad, but by all means avoid the daily market catch.  It was not fresh at all!  Very over priced!  For nearly $25 for a simple white fish they could have at least taken the bones out of the thing.  It tasted like it had been sitting around all day (or two) in its own juices, and when I let the waiter/bartender know he just ignored it and then ignored us until we left.  I will never be back for the food.  The Rum flights are worth a trip there, but that is it.~~#~0
Hnnngffff their signature spinach pizzaIt's the only thing I've ever ordered thereAnd it alone warrants 5 stars.~~#~1
This place is fantastic. Great food, superior service, gorgeous decor... I had a Breakfast Casserole and a generous side of Cheesy Grits. My girlfriend had the Blue Plate Special which was a frittata. The Breakfast Casserole is a medley of sausage, roasted vegetables, and potatoes with cheese, topped with a poached egg. There were no overwhelmingly strong or weak flavors, and I didn't see any extra oil in the dish. It came with a side of toast. I chose the marble rye and was disappointed only to see that the butter it came with was a hard stick. The grits were definetly made with milk and butter and had some cheddar cheese sprinkled across the top. The grits were more solid than watery which was a big plus for me, as I prefer my grits closer to the drier end of the spectrum. After breakfast I ordered a bloody mary at the bar inside and it was spicy and delish, a really good balance of tomato to booze. I liked it a lot. What I liked the most, though, was the really good service and friendly attention we got from our server, the hostess, the bartender, the bar manager, the valet drivers, and even being greeted by the concierge and check-in when we weren't even staying at the hotel. I will definetly make it a point to come here again.~~#~1
This is a brand new delicatessen who's grand opening was September 24th 2008.  Since I don't have a kitchen in my place, this re-heat one-stop shop near my neighborhood will be a place I plan to frequent via walking.  They have a cute cook book lounge and the deli layout is fun to just paroose.  Their chocolate chip cookies taste home made.  So nice to still feel like you have some input in the cooking preparation process when you live with just a microwave.~~#~1
Cheap!  Cheap!  Beware!  If you order Chicken McNuggets from this McDonald's they will charge you 10 cents for each sauce packet over the alloted quantity.  Either go to another McDonald's where they don't charge, go to another restaurant that values your business and NOT nickel and dime you to death or don't eat!~~#~0
Until they get their quality under control, we won't eat here except for lunch. We ate here last weekend and both had the roasted chicken. The problem was it tasted like it was basted in cinnamon and the sauce for the risotto had at least 10 whole peppercorns on each of our plates. I actually bit into to one before I realized that the sauce was just crawling with them. They could've strained them out, processed them in, whatever, just don't serve me a plate with a bunch of whole peppercorns. This tasted NOTHING like the previous visit when I ordered the same exact dish. When we finally let the management know that our food was unacceptable, he said the best he could do was a 20% discount. Well. we  weren't looking for a free or discounted meal, but rather some acknowledgement that they actually cared about the food. That never happened. Unless something changes, the burgers are decent and that is about it.~~#~0
holy shit i love this place.I have been a regular here for years. Eating at oregano's after a long work/school week is really something to look forward to.The food is great. Its reasonably priced, the portions are huge, and the drinks are tall. don't expect anything CRAZY culinary creations here, its just not part of the restaurant's culture. The food is simple and everything is tasty. I usually go with the Sausage Sandwich, or one of the pasta dishes with whole grain pasta, and one of their giant meat balls. Its always filling, always good.Sure the wait is long, but they always have free pizza, drinks, and deserts while you are waiting. Service is always great. Friendly, prompt, and they don't bother you when you don't need them. All of the servers are always willing to play along with my friends and our inappropriate conversations, challenges, etc.~~#~1
My boyfriends company has been doing business with this PostNet store for the last 4 years. Service is friendly, prompt and helpful.I highly recommend it.~~#~1
Nice Plaza.  Very well located.  Clean store.  Friendly staff.   All you could want~~#~1
Great place - nice ambiance, cool decor, tasty food and good service!We were going to check out the Spotted Donkey, but finding it out of business, we noticed Grassroots across the parking lot and decided to check it out.  My daughter got the brisket sandwich (she let me try a bite - nice combination of BBQ sauce, slaw and pickles - but she picked out the pickles and slaw!)  The fries were quite nice as well.  I tried the short ribs - asian fusion sauce with asparagus and jalapeño cheesy grits...I've never been a fan of grits, but these were tasty!  The ribs were very nice...the sauce reminded me of something my Mom used to make (but I can't quite put my finger on what it was, but it was familiar).  A browned with toffee flakes and gelato on top capped off a very nice dinner.  (And you've gotta love a place that has the Gadsden flag as part of it's decor).  Definitely will be coming back!  (and my apologies to our attentive and helpful server for not having been more demonstrative of my appreciation for the food...it was quite good, I just wasn't in a 'dang that's good!' mood last night)  Check this place out!!~~#~1
I work on a local event called Ignite Phoenix, and somewhere in the mix we contacted Splinter Creative about helping us with the design and material for our event. We were completely new to this game and didn't really know what good branding and imagery could do for us. They stepped in, gave us some amazing ideas, helped us refine them, and delivered some incredible material that wowed everyone who attended.So we asked them to stick with us for our next event, and they did it again. They keep upping the game, and I now work with them across several different business that I work on.  They've helped me through several difficult creative areas, and the end result is always sharp, professional, interesting, and engaging.  I prefer to work with people who are passionate about what they do, and do it well.  Splinter fits that bill perfectly.  Highly recommended.~~#~1
I don't have much time to write this, but I do want to say a few things. I had four things so far here. My friend and I both enjoyed them immensely. I paid $16 + tip. I had the [A1 - Cha Gio - crispy egg rolls ] & [A2 - Goi Cuon Thit Tom - spring rolls] to start.Oh man was this delicious. The first thing I loved when I walked in was the ambiance. Dim lit and let the sun do the lighting - very zen - if you're into that. I felt very comfortable here.They had four sauces on the table. I have no idea what they are, but the one with red pepper flakes and oil -- the darker one -- oh wow. If you like heat added to whatever you're doing -- wow -- this stuff is for you! I loved it. Then I went with the Pho tai - sirloin soup. [P2* - Pho tai] - wow - broth was amazing. Everything was. For me, enjoying food means I need a few things. First - awesome foodSecond - ambianceThird - presentationThey had it all. I was very impressed by place to the plates. Don't change a thing. I hope  your business is very prosperous!~~#~1
The Valley Beer Drinkers Meetup Group has been coming here for months - since before the name change - on occasional Wednesdays for $3 craft pints & the fantastic wings special. We've always had a good experience, and the extensive, rotating brew selection keeps the venue fresh.I've been urging the owner to add at least ONE Pilsner to the IPA-heavy menu, and last night he delivered with a quintessential model: Munchener Spaten Pils! It was great.Adding to the experience was the excellent food. Portions were generous and satisfying!. One member ordered the Fish & Onion Rings, and when it arrived, two others immediately ordered their own! I can't remember better fish (pollack here) or more perfect onion rings! Homemade potato chips were remarkable, and the fry cook definitely knows the craft! Diners have many options for sides w/ entrees, which is a generous touch. Only the cole slaw was a bit bland. Service was friendly & generally good, but not attentive enough later in the meal. Thanks for separate checks, too.I really look forward to returning for brews and to further explore the enticing menu!~~#~1
Do not get your oil changed at this walmart or any walmart. We got a oil change and they dented our oil pan and now it leaks and they are not taking responsibility for the damages they caused. I have only had my oil changed for the last year here and they are trying to put it off on someone else, when no one else has clearly done our oil. The insurance for walmart wont even look at my vehicle and had already decided they are not at fault. I had a 3rd party appraiser look at it and they can only determine it was from an oil change. I have no other option but to take this to a lawyer.~~#~0
The democratic party of Arizona consists of a nice group of  people. I visited their office several years ago with some questions and they were quite helpful.~~#~1
It was my Birthday and my wife, her mom, a dear friend and I headed to Fleming's Steakhouse in Chandler, AZ. We heard only great things about this place and wanted to experience their 'unforgettable' steak dishes. That, we did, unfortunately. The restaurant was lovely dim-lit, adequate atmosphere for an expensive steak place. We were seated immediately and tended to by the waiting staff. The small roll of bread and two kinds of butter were good but insufficient for four hungry souls and we polished it up right away. No one offered to bring more. Our waiter told us about the daily specials, after which we ordered food and wine. After a short wait, four large dinner plates arrived. I was the lucky one, my steak (a large  rib eye steak, ordered medium-rare which tasted very good despite two large blobs of fat) was sitting pretty in the middle of the large dinner plate. Nothing else on my plate, just the steak. I looked around at my wife's plate and couldn't believe, her fillet mignon was laying there, in the middle of the large dinner plate without anything garnishing it, be that a glaze, a leaf, a slice of whatever! At the prices asked by this restaurant, it felt like an insult to each of us to have such a poor presentation of a steak!! We asked our waiter for a side dish, mashed potatoes with Parmesan, and when they arrived, we couldn't believe it! There were no more than two scraggly potatoes turned into mashed potatoes, or about a tablespoon of mashed potatoes per person. Mind you, they tasted good, but at over $9.00 per side dish? In short, we left hungry and wondering why we spent over $200 for the entire meal.Next time, we'll go to a well tried place for steaks and more. Durant's, downtown Phoenix and worth the drive.~~#~0
Terrible experience here. They cut up my foot when trying to remove a callus. Also, they told me they used shellac when it was really gelish. Wish I could recommend, but I wouldn't want anyone else to go through the same experience.~~#~0
Food was really good. Waitstaff were all really friendly and helpful in selecting drinks and entree. Would for sure go back.~~#~1
Mostly I love the Rokerij just because I love saying the name.  But the food is also killer.  I had the most amazing chicken, and the sides, which usually I just take for granted as filler food, were sodelicious that they caught my attention in a big way.  I also tried my date's steak, and while it was fairly spendy, it sure seemed worth it.The feel of the place is great too, with the dark stone walls and coziness without feeling too crowded.  We ventured downstairs to look at the bar, and had we been there early enough to snag a couch I wouldn't have wanted to leave.It definitely feels like a splurge, or somewhere you'd take a business associate or date that you wanted to wow.  It's manages a high end feel, while remaining unmistakably local.  I can't say I'd suggest it just for any old night, but it will stay on top of my list for special occasions.~~#~1
This is a great MMA gym.  Instructors are profesional, the facility is clean, and they work well with all experience levels.~~#~1
We have a show quality teacup Yorkie and a 5 Pound Maltese, who has issues, and they handle them beautifully! The owners attitude is all about making sure you are happy and your dogs are too! We were using a place across the street where the owner was all about taking your money and then booking you with who ever was available, even if you had an appointment with a particular groomer! These guys are the best, they CARE, and it's a pleasure to give them our business. Just Go!!!! :-)~~#~1
I live within walking distance of the Japanese Friendship Garden, so I enjoy it frequently.  Once inside, it's hard to believe you're still in Phoenix.  That's why I was so happy when Groupon recently offered a half-price membership.  I would join in a minute, except they're closed from May to October or so.  Half-price membership seems about right.The atmosphere is gentle and meditative.  I feel safe sitting on a bench and actually meditating here.  The koi kind of freak me out.  They've been fed so often  by visitors that I feel fairly certain they'd eat me if I fell into the pond.  Last time I visited, there were baby ducks in the house.  So cute and fluffy, and they had no fear of people.~~#~1
There is only one reason  why I shouldn't love this pizza.Waiting an OBSCENE amount of time for a pizza is a pretty big one. If this pizza was not as good I would be angry I think.I would tell you about it ( HERE)... but you know what its that good. I have had pizza around the world ,its not the best..... but this is pretty close to the best you are going to get in this area code. I would love to say don't believe  "the hype" but yo there is a reason you have to wait sometimes as long as 4+ hours for a pizza on a Saturday night. Lets really face the reality of that night though. You are gonna want to hang  around at other bars drinking with your friends anyway.Its certainly not going to be a cheaper night of entertainment either.. Armed with that information you know what to expect. While there is another place close by that is just as good but not as central.This is worth it just to know what people are talking about.This Pizza is wood fired and made with world class ingredients. The thin cust is perfect. The service at least for me was rushed and sorta unplesant. We were literally the last people in there by the time they sat us, so I am not sure if that behavior / treatment is normal. Not a place to pop in and grab a bite to eat with a small group but if you are REALLY not in rush then this place is one of the best in AZ.~~#~1
Cheese Curds!   They have been so hard to find in AZ.    Like the Jalepeno ones too.Really good fresh milk.   Worth the stop.Bring cash, not credit or debit cards~~#~1
I have lived all over the US, and I have experienced extreme lows and highs with dentists, but this dental group is by far my favorite I have ever been a patient of. I can't say enough good about them, so I won't ramble.... Just love them.~~#~1
I'm really not the type to want to go out for breakfast, I'd rather save my dining money for lunch or dinner because I figure I can usually make just as good of a breakfast at home.  However, there is no way I could match their french toast, it is just outstanding.  We have been twice and I ordered that both times.  The first time, I told the waitress to put the berry sauce on the side because I usually don't like fruit toppings, they are too sweet and fake tasting.   But this sauce is delicious! It is homemade and very natural tasting, I ate every bit of it.  We also loved the jalepeno bacon.  My kids loved the pigs in a blanket.  We had very nice service both times, we will definitely be back!~~#~1
Are you kidding me, this place is great.  Perfectly sized bread, quality ingredients, cool staff.  When I think dream sub, I think italian night club no mayo, and extra peppers.  Don't get no betta!~~#~1
This place is worse than the IRS, at least the IRS admits when they made a mistake. But these arrogant workers will be caught dead before they hear themselves say "sorry for the inconvenience" or "we made a mistake".  They gave me different information on two consecutive visits that I made, then Dorrie, some lady who obviously should not have been working that day because she was coughing phlegm all over my documents, then after she asked me to wait by the counter for 10 minutes while their system updated. I waited, 1 hour and 30 minutes later I finally went to the information counter and asked for Dorrie... I was told that she had gone to lunch 15 minutes ago and was told to go talk to another lady. She just dismissed me and I went to go talk to the new lady, who was also extremely rude and kept rolling her eyes and interrupting me before I could finish my sentences.  Basically i spent total of 3 and a half hours waiting and getting attitude and nothing was resolved because of their mis information and Dorries idiot customer service ethics and the last ladys pride..  not one person resolved anything and they all were too proud to say "we apologize for the inconvenice".  I recommend this place if you wanna be late to work 2 or more hours and having your mild mannered patience tested to the maximum.~~#~0
In terms of Mexican joints this place is the best.  With the outdoor atmosphere, tacky decor and authentic food, it just doesn't get any better.  The other locations are just as good.  The staff is usually pretty cool too, although one time we waited a VERY long time to get served at the Scottsdale location.~~#~1
One of the things I love about my neighborhood is that Cornish Pasty is w/in walking distance.Every pasty Ive had here is awesome. My personal faves include the shepherds pie, the chicken pot pie, and the thanksgiving pasty.Yes its tiny and loud, but it adds to the charm. Also, the smell that you smell right when you walk in the door= heaven.We eat in and get to go. Tip for to go: have a beer or a cider w/ your wait.~~#~1
An organized & clean store, a well educated & nice staff, a great selection of baby/kid products! I will never go to a babies r us again. Thank you Chandler buybuybaby!~~#~1
Place is awsome.  Got the beef cheesesteak and everything was great.  The bread was possibly the best I have ever had.  Price was pretty good.  Just over 9 bucks for a whole sammich and soda.  While waiting I walked around and I plan on going back for some shopping.  Lots of pasta, sauces and just about anything you could want for Italian food.  5 stars all the way.~~#~1
Grew up in San Antonio and Austin. Have traveled extensively and sampled BBQ all over the country. The term Texas-style means beef, first. Period. And good smoke, and that ain't mesquite. Oak is king. These guys have changed the face of Phoenician BBQ forever. It's a shame that the Scottsdale location was touched by ... well, Scottsdale. Friggin morons. If you have not been here, you need to go down to 24th and E. Roeser and try it. Hands down the best Q in the area, including Cave Creek. The guys are FROM Texas and they know the whats, wheres and hows of Bar-B-Que. And for those "the meal in a carton on butcher paper" snobs who think that such is declasse, please, do me a favor... Head on down to Austin or, better yet, Lockhart. Stand at the front of the line at Stubbs or Black's or Kruez Market and loudly proclaim your thoughts as a BBQ aficionado. Just let me know when you are heading down so I can hang out and watch the ensuing festivities. Freud said it best: BBQ and being horrifically anally-retentive is ALL about your unfulfilled dreams of your Auntie Ma. Or, shut up and grow up ya infantile gomers...~~#~1
Mmm dirty hipster bars.  Let me count the ways in which I love you.You are cheap (we had $2 Stellas)You are interesting (local art on the walls that I'm told changes regularly)You are full of pretension (people watching is always worth the price of admission)You are friendly (like minded souls can smell each other out)If you are in the Roosevelt district, I highly recommend stopping in for happy hour.  Its cheap and hipstery.  Both words have been used to describe me, so I am naturally predisposed to this place.~~#~1
I try and eat here regularly. Hummus is great. Very personable staff. And the atmosphere is awesome. Look forward to the next time!~~#~1
I really love this gym. It is so nice and well maintained. There is always plenty of towels to grab before a workout.  The childcare is excellent and has the security part down. When you sign up as a member you and your child are given assigned wristbands to use during visits. The staff have always been good about ensuring the numbers on them match prior to releasing my child to me. You can even tune into the cameras to watch your child on the tv's that are on the cardio equipment. Childcare is also open 7 days a week and doesnt close for lunch like most gyms. There is also plenty of group classes throughout the day if you are into Zumba or cycling,etc. I recommend this gym to anyone especially parents needing quality childcare.~~#~1
Been dying to come here ever since I saw this place on Unique Eats. Very laid back gastropub with a friendly, funny/entertaining staff!  We grabbed drinks at the bar first - Moe'scow Mule (ginger beer, cucumber, lime, rocks) & the Persian (Absolut Wild Tea vodka, St. Germain elderflower liqueur, sweet & sour, Persian cucumber juice, lemon peel, rocks) which were both good, not too strong, but a good refreshing drink.Appetizers:1) Pork Belly Pastrami (rye spaetzle, Brussels sprout sauerkraut)2) The Original Chopped SaladPlease order both. They were both delicious! I was in love with the salad especially.Entrees:1) Lamb Burger (Serbian lepinja roll, pickled cucumber-onion, tzatziki, Kennebec French fries & house made ketchup) I tend to be very picky about my lamb... Actually I'm not reallly a fan of it/the particular taste and smell lamb has. Why I ordered this, I don't know, but I can tell you that I liked it. The taste/odor of lamb wasn't overwhelming and it was juicy.2) Pan Seared Scallops (Hampshire bacon, roasted corn grits, wilted snow pea greens & Red Rock cola gastrique)3) Amaro Meatloaf (Montenegro Amaro Italian liqueur, pork, beef, parsnip meatloaf, smashed Yukon gold potatoes, roasted zucchini, veal demi-glace): the server described it as very meaty and meaty it was! Usually meatloaf is fluffed up with a lot of bread crumbs, but this one was mainly just meat. The mashed potatoes were very good as well.~~#~1
Maybe their dogs are better, but breakfast sandwiches at Nathan's are disgusting! The English muffin was spongy, the eggs greasy, the bacon undercooked... And all premade and wrapped ready to melt together into mush with the cheese. Yuck!!!~~#~0
Do Taco Jedis work at Senor Taco? Yes. Yes they do.Is the force of making killer fast Mexican food strong with these Jedis? Oh hell yeah!Try the shredded beef tacos in the hard shells. When they ask you if you want hot sauce, say 'si' and drizzle it mightily onto the tacos. Piled cheese, beef, lettuce, tomatoes all stuffed into an authentic-style taco shell - it doesn't get any better than this. Just make sure you put a helmet on because it's crazy good.If you like spicy, no-nonsense burritos, go with the Carne Asada Burrito (Red Chile).If you like the whole meal, go with the Carne Asada or Pollo Asado burrito combo plates. The plate comes with flour tortillas, beans and rice, guacamole and salsa fresca. You make your own burritos. This is just good eatin'. Take it home, crack open a good Hefeweizen, and you are golden.And lastly, from the sage words of my wife: "The shrimp tacos and burritos are certified gourmet meals!" Do I stutter? Nope.While Senor Taco is technically 'fast food' it does take some time to prepare. If you do drive-thru don't get all road ragey if it takes longer than it does at Taco Bell. There is a price to pay to make good food and that price is TIME. This is not a worldwide chain that spends more on advertising and earning your business by putting cute little dogs on plastic mugs. Senor Taco is not that type of place. A little wait is very much worth it.I realize that appearance of the location irks some reviewers. Yes, it is in a strip mall. Yes it is 100-150 feet away from a gas station slash AM/PM mini market. I get that. But this is not Sanctuary. This is not Kai. This is not Deseo. When one reviewer (and I use the word 'reviewer' loosely here) hilariously claims to have walked in, used his Superman vision to supposedly spot a family of offending microbes and (without trying the food) proceeded to sprint out because he was frightened of all the imagined cooties ... well... I just have to laugh. That's not a review, it's a drive-by, and reviewers like this are probably happier with Hometown Buffet or Luby's Cafeteria. And that's too bad because this is excellent fast food.I've eaten here maybe 15-20 times and my wife has ordered the fish taco plate a number of times and neither of us has ever gotten sick. The people at Senor Taco are nice, the food pleasantly surprises and your expectation of fast Mexican food will be forever changed for the better. I can't recommend highly enough.~~#~1
Stopped in looking for some break from the heat after a couple hours shopping.  They have a happy hour menu that we tried several dishes from and all were very good.  Menu also has a good selection of alcoholic drinks nut we stuck to H2O hydration instead.  Staff and management were very attentive.  Would definitely recommend.~~#~1
I've been Dr. Castilla's office for 7 years.  Her office has relocated and her practice has grown over the years and for good reason.  She is a Dr. that treats you as a person and takes her time to honestly answer your questions.  She makes eye contact with you and I couldn't ask for anything more.  Just remember, it is a large practice and the staff is sometimes questionable.  But, she's worth the wait!  Now that we've relocated, I hate to give up Dr. Castilla.  She's irreplaceable!~~#~1
there is none better.  This taco shop is off the beaten path hidden and mixed in next to a smoke shop and behind a circle k.  Parking can be at a premium but the payoff is the food.  great friendly service, low key on the inside and flavors and textures that rock your socks off!!  I mean really.  My favorite taco shop in the valley, or more to the point prob. one of the best in the west!  the burros are as think as a mans arm, the tacos are soooo good. i especially like the chorizo, the lingua is good, the carne is excellent.  have a cane sugar coke in a bottle and find a seat, inside or out you will savor the flavors and be sure to use the sides of grilled peppers and onions, they make the meal for me.  now where to go for lunch ?~~#~1
Such strange combinations of flavors, yet they taste so good.  We've been here three or four times and are never disappointed.~~#~1
Good reviews are easy to write. Stop reading this and just go eat there! OK, well I have visited this place for years now and don't go anywhere else if I am in this area. I like the Chef's, they are friendly and quick. They speak pretty good Spanish to me and but I don't dare try to respond in Japanese, ha ha. The value is phenomenal, where can two people get miso soup, salad, beans, tea, ice cream and sushi rolls all for under $20? I've tried the same at Say Sushi in my hometown of Maricopa and can't do it for under $40 or more for two. All you can eat is available but I find that ordering individually is more economical. Great atmosphere for a quick lunch or a large party for dinner. The waitresses are Asian and I find that suitable for the restaurant. Some reviews on here complain about them. I don't have any issue with them they have always treated me nice and done their job well. I will keep coming back.~~#~1
Thank you Jen & Mike for making what I expected to be a hard decision so easy! My boyfriend and I will do all of our future shopping at this location! Whatever you need here ask for them, Jen is the store manager and Mike was more than amazing! They told us that not many people knew about this location and I promised I would change that! Make sure to post your awesome experience next!  I love my ring!!!!~~#~1
Best calamari in town, and awesome service. Tokyo glow is a great drink, super refreshing.~~#~1
Yes, it's pricey, so I got a membership. Yes, the membership is pricey - but if you go frequently (and you'll want to with the hot summer months) you'll get your money's worth and then some. The place is big enough that you can do different exhibits for each trip. Great place to take the grandparents to watch the kids in their element, too!~~#~1
We were greeted with very friendly staff.  We had the fried knocci for an appetizer with a fabulous marinara sauce - usually do not order knocci but these came recommended and were very good.  The bread was crusty on the outside & chewy on the inside -very yummy.  We sat at the bar as we usually do and the bartender brought over a sample of their meet sauce to try with more bread.  I don't eat meat sauce but my husband said it was very good.  I had a heft cosmo & my husband had a beer.  For dinner i had the pasta trio that was fabulous - probably the best italian food i've had since the cioppino at Allesia's restaurant.  My husband had the linguine with white clam sauce also very good.  I'm certain these pasta dishes were homemade because they just had amazing flavor - I wanted more!! We finished with tiramisu that was also really great.  My husband had coffee and even that was great.  A little pricey in my opinion for italian food but due to how great all of it tasted -  we think it was worth it.  This will be a definite dining destination in the future.~~#~1
Experience with Hostess was rude. Service with a frown. Our waiter had attitude too. It was a birthday dinner and we were in great spirits..so this review is written with clarity. The margaritas were strong-check ok there. The shrimp appetizer was different and very good and $18 for four shrimp. We ordered two mahi mahi dinners (each $24)and they were RANCID. Yup. I said RANCID. We asked if the shrimp fajitas dinner had the same jumbo and they said they would have to charge extra (each entree was priced at $30) we had to pay extra for the beans and rice that they had left on the table-which was cold by the time the shrimp dinner--which came with 5 shrimp and onions.  Poor service with an attitude. Mediocre food to say the least...all over-priced. Never going back.~~#~0
Great food their pork is awesome !!!!  The slow cooking made this dish superb.   Of course the margaritas are as good as they get!Overall everyones food was tasty and the service was great.  The place was very busy with allot of energy.~~#~1
I can't remember the name of the special salad we had tonight with Shrimp, but I will never forget the taste.  FABULOUS is an understatement!  The NY pizza was equally as great.  Every time I come here I say to myself, we need to come more often.  Everything is always good.Diane was our server tonight.  What a cutie!  More important is that the service was excellent!  Diane was back at our table many times checking to see if there was anything else she could do for us.  Another comment I want to make is there was a young man taking care of the table.  At some point I thanked him and was surprised to receive "Your more than welcome", instead of the typical "No Problem" statement coming from young people.  I should have gone to the management to tell them I was impressed by him, his smile and mannerisms.We will be back!~~#~1
Like they even need another review - they have a solid 5 stars as it is!Just got back from my first visit to Adobe, and I am beyond impressed. My German Shepherd pup was having some stomach issues over the holidays, so I decided to have him checked out to be on the safe side. I knew he didn't have an obstruction or other emergency issue, but I was concerned about parasites.The receptionist, Hilary, was super sweet on the phone and in person. She was upfront with what tests she thought would be ordered, and how much it would run me (and it wasn't an arm and a leg; the office call was only $56). I was very happy they'd be able to see me the next morning, but then she called back not 20 minutes later with a cancellation and said to come on in. Even better! The tech was very good with Nately's 40 pounds of squirming, and loved on him the whole time. I was also happy they let me help hold him - I've been to vets that called in a 2nd tech, like the owners aren't capable of safely holding their own dog. Okay, maybe some aren't, but I am, and I appreciate being able to and not being instructed like a child.Dr. Newland was AWESOME.The difference between him and some other vets I've been to?- Other vets: "Oh my God, we need to run $500 worth of expensive tests and start him on multiple medications", general sense of admonishment for not rushing him to their affiliated ER clinic, eagerness to run the bill up, very few questions about anything, etc... -Dr. Newland:  Super calm and personable. He spent 20 minutes going over everything (Nately's last few days of activity and stomach issues, diet, contact with other dogs, where I take him in public, anything he could think of really), felt his abdomen thoroughly, and said "Honestly, he's a puppy, they eat funny things, and something probably just irritated his stomach. He's plainly feeling pretty good, so just feed him a bland diet, give him this medication to settle his stomach, and bring a stool sample just in case, so you know for sure he's parasite-free".  He also dispensed advice for Nately's general care, as long as we were there, about heartworm prevention and  necessary vaccines, etc. I even got a good education on the different types of parasites and which were even likely in AZ's climate (turns out, not many). I really appreciated that he didn't try to frighten me into expensive diagnostics and possible serious diseases, and that he is so on his game and scientific/logical about things.I am very impressed and will be making Adobe my regular vet for as long as possible. If only they treated birds too!~~#~1
T&S Glass did a wonderful job replacing my car window. They came right to the house within 2 hours of my call, had the window replaced within 30 minutes and treated me like a queen. Frank installed the glass and couldn't have been nicer. Thank you T & S Glass!!~~#~1
When I think Royal Palms, I think romantic getaway. A quaint yet exquisite resort, the Royal Palms was built in 1929 to emulate a colonial Spanish retreat. Colonial as in when the Spaniards were conquering the New World.  All of the historical details are presented on a frescoed wall in one of the courtyards.  We had heard some great things about J Cook's and decided to spend a leisurely Sunday morning dining on the patio. If you're looking to be treated like royalty, you want to dine hereI enjoyed exploring the hotel after a luxe breakfast at J.Cooks.  The staff are incredibly accomodating.  What an ideal location for an intimate stay-cation!  It's a nice place to go to grab some drinks and appetizers, I will definitely be back to see what more the resort has to offer!~~#~1
I was there just last night, and today received a ROTD for my original review. Too weird.Updates - They mix a great margarita! No fluorescent green pre mixed Margarita mix - they make it themselves with fresh lime juice. Yum.The wine list is small but good. My current fave is the Argentinian Malbec.  It's only $6 a glass, and they pour generously. Very tasty wine.The seating is not comfy if you like to slouch. If you sit up straight, it's fine. But seriously.... good posture is over rated.It gets a little cold in there once in a while during the winter. Wear long sleeves. :) After 3 glasses of the Malbec last night, I didn't care.This place has really been growing on me... nice to have such a great neighborhood watering hole!~~#~1
Amazing Mexican food and the drinks are knock you on your ass good.  Have the guacamole and a madre then come and talk to me.~~#~1
I love this store.  The produce is always fresh, they have an interesting selection of frozen items including some great appetizers, the meat department is outstanding - I've tried a few different kabobs from here (spicy kabob rocks), bakery is great, nice selection of hard to find dairy items like fig yogurt, fair cheese selection including a local fresh burrata and mozzarella that will knock your socks off, excellent selection of wines and craft beer, and a floral department that has exquisite arrangements.Aside from the above, they make great sandwiches, have a nice salad bar, have different take out dinners available every night, have a pasta night and will make you a fantastic iced tea or an iced latte that rivals any chain.  They also have an awesome grill - they will make you a kobe blue cheese burger that is out of this world.  The hot dogs are delicious but they are gigantic (and a little unsettling to look at).One piece of advice before you go, not everything turns over quickly so check the dates.~~#~1
I'm not sure why it has taken me so long to actually go inside Go-Kat-Go, but I finally did and loved it!  This store is filled with all sorts of great retro Hawaiian treasures along with a plethora of other gems.  We've got locally designed clothing in one corner, awesome furniture in another, tons of handmade accessories in the middle and bunches of fun throughout!  It was really hard not to pick up everything in this store and buy it.  The owner was really nice and offered to hold our stuff while we shopped.  I ended up walking out of there with an awesome Dia de los Muertos pillow that looks amazing on my new couch plus a matching potholder/oven mitt set in a really cool pattern.  I will definitely be back, especially since my other mom's b-day is coming up and she loves this kind of stuff.~~#~1
Went back to True Foods ( i have been doing this a lot since my first trip) with my mom for dinner last week. It was amazing as always however this time was different. I tried a new menu item, the Bison burger ( i highly reccomend this) it was so tastey and very light for a burger. OMG! I want to say that this time was different because we had THE BEST SERVICE EVER! Our server Marcus was amazing. He was very informative, helpful, polite and everything you would expect from a server and then some. LOVE THIS CAT. Just thought I would give credit where it is due. Too many times you read about the negatives on service and not so often the positives. I work in a restaurant and know it's important for employers to know who their "stars" are. MARCUS is your star. A bright, and shiney star. lolLoves: Shitaki mushroom lettuce cups, Ahi sliders, Spaghetti Squash, Kale Salad, Raviolli, Green Tea, Coffe (black) and I always have to have the Banana chocolate Tart. Definitely .~~#~1
I was really looking forward to eating here this morning when I got to the restaurant and found that everything was super clean and nice looking. I had been drinking all night and it was time for some breakfast. They had a great selection of hot tea. The people in my party got quite a few things and everything came in heaping portions. The French toast is the super thick kind and very fluffy. They also proved that they can really cook eggs well. They also brought lots of coffee and hot water for all of us.I also go their chicken tortilla soup and it was AMAZING.The service was super fantastic! I will definitely come here again. :)~~#~1
Treated some clients to Sweet Pea Bakery items and they loved them!  I got the PB & J cookies , Mojito cookies and Rum macaroons.  Love that they are not the run of the mill flavors.The shop is adorable, it's actually really big-- surprisingly big!  The employees are really nice and personable and that is always helpful and welcoming, especially when trying something/some place new. They even gave me a precious thank you card to put with the cookies.  I will definitely be going back for more!~~#~1
It's the best!  Downstairs, hanging at the bar, you can't beat it!  The food is EXCELLENT!!!~~#~1
Well, this place is as good as it gets. Family owned and awesome. You know how at some mexican places the beans and rice are an afterthought? Not here. They are the best I have ever had, yes even in mexico. The food is seasoned perfectly and the service is exceptional. Too bad they are closed Sundays. The queso is the best I have ever had. I could keep going but you get the picture. Go there, order and eat, you will not be disappointed.~~#~1
One star is far more than they deserve.  The owner of the property spent an excessive amount of time barking out reminders of hotel policy, was rude to guests and his staff.  The stay here felt more like being in prison with the warden constantly in your face.  People in the group that stayed were locked out of the room by management, forced to pay made up fines.  The owner ruined the entire experience.  If this is how customers are treated, this place won't be around long.~~#~0
This is the best buffet in Az. HUGE variety from veggie dishes, fish, shrimp, mussels, and even sushi. The quality of food is very good too. One thing I have learned is when looking for good Asian food, look inside! This place is always full of beautiful asian folks so you know its good. Just sayin'. For a buffett, they have a really nice staff. There is a shrimp dish with a sweet cream sauce that is amazing. It is more pricey than most asian buffets but well worth the extra few bucks. I eat here at least once every couple weeks.~~#~1
NOOOO!!! Don't think about it!!!!Had my windshield replaced by these schmucks. The morons tore up the interior of my car, and damaged a speaker cover. I had to call them about replacing the cover thrice, they finally did, and then I found out that there was a HUGE air leak in the corner. They never fixed the interior trim.They sent out the same first idiots to plug the leak, and they ended up breaking a ton of clips for a covering on my car, ruining the windshield wiper covers, and DOUSING my tweeter in water. I called immediately after they left and got harassed by a "manager" because he just had hip surgery (why is this my fault?!) and couldnt come until a week out!Whatever incentives they offer are not worth the TERRIBLE craftsmanship and poor service. I am exploring my options with a lawyer, and have reported them to BBB.~~#~0
This place is great!!! They grow alot of the food they use and if they do not grow, they buy it local!!! The food tastes great...don't forget to get a milkshake. It is also a great place to sit and eat outside, nice!~~#~1
I now have a sixth Sens for delicious Asian tapas- a genre I never knew existed. I always assumed the best tapas disappeared when Aaron May sauteed Sol Y Sombra's last batch of butter-marinated brussels sprouts! Well, I was proven wrong when I hit up the ultra-cool Sens Asian Tapas & Sake on a Thursday night. Guests are greeted by electric blue lights, neon pink lotus blossom light fixtures and fresh beats courtesy of a hipster DJ, which transport the hungry to an intoxicating, fluorescent experiens filled with sauces, sakes, and spicy flavors they probably don't even know about yet. I tried three top-notch items:Wasabi Tofu- Hot, in every Sens of the word. Wasabi and 300-degree tempura crusties have the ability to burn you to your soul if you aren't careful. Don't skip it, just poke it with a chopstick or blow on it first. White Peach Juice and Vodka- Just like Japanese candy exchange students brought home in high school, it's one of those miraculous flavors most Americans will never have the opportunity to try. Light and sweet, but not overly so, it's a perfect blend you can sip all.night.long. (I did!)The best, by far, is the Hot & Sour Soup. It's nothing like the kind you get for .99 at Chinese restaurants as an appetizer. A Bilbo Baggins-ey cauldron arrives with a wooden ladle- among the various veggies and disc-shaped noodles is your choice of meat- I chose clams. I've always heard you can truly tell how talented a chef is by how tasty his soup is, and would have to agree. There's nothing to hide behind, and you're confronted by pure flavor. It was complex, different and mouthwatering.The whole Sens-ation was so genius, I even got past the embarrassment of Chef Johnny Chu snorting in my face for taking pics of my meal on my iPhone.~~#~1
I have a serious Banana Republic problem. Rewind time to about three years ago when I bought my first dress from BR. I had just gotten my first full time "real job" after finishing college and I needed a wardrobe to match my new position. It is now three years later and I have probably close to twenty dresses from BR. The only issue I have is they leave me pretty darn broke, so when I heard BR had a factory store I was stoked! So last weekend I dragged my husband, sister and niece down to Anthem to check this place out.It was crowded, but the prices of the items definitely make up for it. That is, when you find something worth buying. The selection of items is a little weird, and you have to fight with many other women to get into the racks with the good stuff. But I managed to find two 100% cotton dresses that are both casual and work appropriate at the same time. Priced originally at $80 with a markdown to $40 on the rack, they also had a 25% off sale on these particular items that day. So I scored two dresses originally totaled for $160 for $60. Sounds like a good deal to me. I wish they had more colors, except that would have been bad for my credit card cause I am sure I would have ended up buying them all. My husband also scored two pairs of jeans, two cotton shirts, and three pairs of boxers for under $100. I can see myself making the 50 minute drive down here at least four times a year to see what new stuff comes in. My dress collection is going to get larger this year, I can tell you that. Also, if you sign up online for the factory store you can get coupons for extra % off your total purchase. So your super discounted items just got even more discounted.~~#~1
I just had my first Tammie Coe cake last week for my birthday, and I will NEVER be the same again.  I don't normally eat cake, in fact, if it's not Brownies, I don't eat it.  But this cake drew me in with it's appealing fondant.  From there, I got lost in the spongy richness of the cake.  A cornicopia of flaverful goodness.So make a metal note to yourself, I will only eat Brownies and Tamie Coe cakes.Oh, and special thanks to Arts G (previous review) for telling me what the hell fondant is.  I was just calling it "sheet like frosting".~~#~1
This place is our go to mexican place. I love the hot sauce and you can't go wrong with the Fundido sauce on the burritos. I personally enjoy the Chicken Fajito Chimi with Fundido sauce. It could possibly be the worst thing there to eat (and I love it). For the healthier days, I like the Pollo Salad. The chicken is always great here.~~#~1
Awesome food. Highly recommend. Had gyros platter . Generous portions and excellent meat.  Check out their spices and other food stuff. Got couscous very cheap.~~#~1
One of our favorite restaurants in the Valley! We go here about once a month. Some of my favorite dishes are the whole fish, salt and pepper shrimp, Pho with everything in it, Spring rolls, Shrimp/Pork over rice noodles, and the Seafood over soft egg noodles. We also have the Vietnamese coffee as our dessert! YUM!~~#~1
Love love love this place. It's a very healthy place to eat and always has awesome food and awesome service!~~#~1
It's a nice newer gym with a good amount of amenities and a relatively friendly staff.  I see cleaners in the club every time I am there which I dont see a lot of at other gyms.  They have a stretch room, full wet area with steam and sauna, free aerobics classes,  a large number of equip,etc.The evenings do get crowded even with all the equipment, so I try to get in and out before 5 or so.All in all a nice spot to get a work out in the area.~~#~1
Finally a teriyaki bowl place that does it right.  Nothing against Samuri Sam's, but Yogis is a bit better in my opinion.  Yogis'  menu is strait forward and clearly lists the options available.  The place is clean and the staff is fast and friendly.  The food is also very reasonably priced.  I was very impressed with their different bowl/plate/salad options.  You are able to order some teriyaki veggies, chicken and/or beef pretty much however you want it.  Extra meat, over lettuce, over veggies, brown rice, white rice, etc.  Anyway, when I visit a place like this my desires are simple.  I want a decent portion of not-overly-sauced white meat chicken over a bunch of veggies.  That's it.  Yogis delivers this and then some.~~#~1
Fantastic venue! The bartenders are nice- the drinks are excellent. The lounge is an amazing place to hang out (best downtown spot?!) even if you aren't going to the show! Cool free shows in the lounge! Now let's talk about the main reason you would go there- THE MUSIC! And the venue itself is awesome! The sound is great! The ROOM IS GREAT! It was designed by someone who knew what concert goers want- an intimate experience with fantastic sound. And so if you have the curse of ALWAYS standing behind the TALLEST DUDES EVER at shows- you can now take advantage of the bleacher seating in the back of the room or benches on the side. THERE IS NOT A BAD SEAT IN THE HOUSE! What is left to say ? GET THERE!~~#~1
I have been to every ballpark in the Cactus League and know my way around them all.  This is, by far, the best facility in all of Spring Training (that includes the Florida parks).  Granted, I am a Dodger fan and we get it better than the 'Sox fans do, but it is still amazing.Camelback Ranch is the brand new, state of the art, spring training facility for the Dodgers and White Sox.  The Sox moved from Tucson because Tucson is the literally SO bad that even people from CHICAGO won't stay there.  The park is located just south of the Glendale Airport and pretty much only has one way in or out - 111th Ave.  You can avoid Camelback Rd by taking Indian School to 111th and then just drive into the stadium.The grounds feature 13 practice fields and a giant lake and river that also help irrigate the fields.  While the White Sox practice fields and clubhouse entry are blocked off from the public, the Dodgers' are wide open and inviting.  Players must walk through the crowds during practices which invited lots of interaction with the fans.  The field is beautiful and the layout of the stadium is quite impressive.  Not only do they have a full Jumbotron but they also feature fully enclosed suites and a full buffet for those willing to shell out $90 per game.  That price gets you seats behind home, access to unlimited food, wine, beer, soda, and sweets.  It also gets you exclusive merchandise as well as cold towels to help you cool off.  It sounds like a lot but it turns out to be worth the money.The grass seats have a great slope to them (much like Scottsdale) and the seat aisles are wide.  The food selection is lacking without Dodger Dogs, however.  The stadium is also missing the independent food vendors that Maryvale and Peoria feature.  A great stadium and surely one to visit every March.~~#~1
I was introduced to SanTan Brewery two years ago on a very cold, winter evening. My cousin knew I would instantly fall in love with this place, simply because I just love fine craft beer.He was surely right because I visit SanTan three times a week because I simply cannot get enough of their beer selection. It's like an adventure every time I go. The staff is fantastic not because they're very nice and friendly, but they have the same passion and enthusiasm for fine craft as I do, so relating to them in that respect makes the experience fantastic.I normally do not engage in writing reviews on websites like this, simply because I personally tell the management team my best regards but I will for this because people really do need to experience the joys this brewery has to offer. SanTan is the new level of drinking and dining experience. It's relaxed, fun mature environment and you can start a conversation with anyone there. Enough reading this review, go try it out yourself.~~#~1
Scottsdale Fashion Square is the king of shopping centers in Arizona. It's unrivaled and it maintains it's crown through constant improvements, expansions, and new stores. Empty stores are rare. Try that on for size, PV mall. The food court is decent, but a wide variety of restaurants surround the mall, providing the shopper with an endless amount of stores, and a great selection of places to eat. Scottsdale Fashion Square aims to please the most critical, and goes above and beyond all expectations.~~#~1
Last night on my way home from work I figured I would pick up some dinner for me and my wife who is taking care of our newborn all day and has little time to cook for us. I ordered chicken limone the menu says serves two to three and we don't eat a lot so I figured it would fill us up. The price was 18.99 but I figured in a family style Italian place and we should have plenty of food. I was handed my bag and I was sure it was the wrong order because it was so light so I checked it in the car and was shocked. I see three small pieces of chicken in a big container with a small piece of bread and that's it! So I figured they just forgot the pasta and went back in and asked the hostess and she said yes it comes with it then said no after thinking about it. So how can they justify that price? It was so small there was no way it would feed 2 people so I had to cook pasta at home and then reheat our chicken in the microwave.I worked in the service industry for years and this place is a joke! FYI just because there's people with money who live near your restaurant doesn't mean you can tailor your food prices to their income level without delivering value.........if you sell crap in the worst neighborhood that same crap should be priced the same in a affluent neighborhood....same crap different place.No value means lost customers ....~~#~0
Music was loud as shit.  The food, Jesus Christ the food.  Lame ass chips and salsa.  No joke, like 8 chips were on the plate.  Salsa was probably one of the worst I've had, no flavor at all and warm.   Salads come out warm (I'm assuming this is why I've been puking).  Gross right, warm lettuce.  Waiter let's us know they can make daughter a little quesadilla (cheese only) which comes out so greasy.  Our taco plates come out 10 minutes later.  2 dinky tacos on each plate that are flavorless and luke warm at best.  Yes, they are spicey, no that does not mean they are flavorful.  I'm literally using my cell phone to see what was on the plate it's so dark.  Mint water was warm.  Gross and not refreshing whatsoever.  My daughter's quesadilla was $13, yes for 2 tortillas smaller than my hand and some 'cheese'.  I get it- make a dollar, but damn, don't rip your customers off.  So over the top lame.  Neither my husband nor myself finished.   Meal was $46.  Horrible.  Health department should go temp that place- I'm not sure the refrigeration is working properly.  Such a disappointment, I've been a vegetarian for 18 years- was looking forward to a new spot.  Won't be returning.  Ever.~~#~0
I have memories that make my mouth water.  My mother calls me everytime she passes through Phoenix to ask me where this place is.  She tells her friends in Los Angeles to come here if they have business or family trips to Phoenix.  They all rave after their experience.  The fry bread house is as authentic as it gets.  Indian tacos, fry bread with sugar, and oh my god--the red chili stew.  I think I just drooled a little on my keyboard.  The place does get a little cramped during meal times, but we used to take ours to go and sit in the park after a bike ride down Central and picnic away and then do our best to ride it off afterwards so we weren't wallowing in the guilt of our deep fried pleasures.  Make sure they are open before you make the trek, they have funky hours.~~#~1
Culinary Dropout is a fantastic place to eat! The interior is very rocker complete with  stage for bands, interesting and yummy food, with an array of beers  and amazing food! If you decide to go (which I don't know why you wouldn't ) try their monkey bread for dessert, it is to die for!~~#~1
As a massage therapist I normally would rather have a massage than get adjusted, that was before Dr. Hunt came to town.  I trust him implicitly, and the techniques he uses are amazing. I take my four year old to see him too, who always greets Dr. Hunt and Larissa with great big hugs. Highly recommend this office, truly feels like family~~#~1
OK guys (and gals too), I know size isn't everything, but OMG, this place has crazy size portions and I loooove it!  We ordered the calamari and the stuffed mushrooms (1/2 orders) and STILL, the servings were huge.  Six big stuffed mushrooms sitting on what seemed to me to be the biggest plate I have ever seen serving an appetizer.  They were great and tasty, but cooled down too quickly and who can do anything about that?  The calamari was decent, could have been spiced up a bit or served with something more than marinara sauce, but for those who don't like a lot of fan fare with their food, this would be perfect; classic calamari with classic sauce.  We loved the Stella Artois draft beer and martinis came out big and filled to the brim, just how I like them.  For our entrees we ordered the Baked Ziti and Sausage and the Rigatoni "D".  Both of them were absolutely fantastic...yumm.  And both were HUGE.  The baked ziti stayed warm right up until we packed the rest to take home because they actually bake it right in the ceramic type dish that they serve it in, very smart.  For those with little ones, the kids menu is awesome and probably the healthiest meal a kid is going to get anywhere.  Nothing at this place is pre packaged or pre made and that goes for the kids meals as well.  Their chicken fingers are home made (the pickiest of adults would eat these things!), no french fries; home made mashed potatoes and broccoli florets.  This is the KIDS menu!  Our waiter needed to be coaxed out of his shell, but he was still warm in that great way that the good ones know how to do without intruding.  Great leather booths, linen napkins, white table cloths with a white and red checkered one thrown on top for added warmth, elegant, but not stuffy.  Guys could go in with t-shirts and dress shorts and fit right in and for the ladies who like to dress up, you can as well with out feeling overly so.I am definitely going here again, what a find!~~#~1
DELICIOUS sandwich prepared fast and just the way I wanted it!  I'll be back for sure!  Welcome to the neighborhood.~~#~1
I always buy my tires at Walmart, but they didn't have a tire to fit my car. They directed me to Discount Tire and told me that they actually have better pricing. I went to this location and had the best experience. They were very helpful, saved me money, and I was in and out in under 25 mins. I will be back again and again!!!!~~#~1
This is the best library in the Valley and one of my favorite places to study.  The interior design, water fall, glass elevators and many other features make this the perfect metropolitan library for our downtown. The top level is pretty quiet and has beautiful views of the city.  Quick Tip: It seems that the southern part of the building is hotter because of the sun so I always sit on the north part of the building.~~#~1
I've never had a hard time at a sonic before, except for this location. They barely speak English, they don't know their own menu, and they messed up my order 2 times. Come on, your job can not be that confusing...~~#~0
Made me and my bro sick. Tasted good at first but something wasn't right.~~#~0
My wife and I were looking for a particular type of rose for our garden. We called this location and asked if they had it in stock and what the price was. They said they did and quoted us a price of $24.99 for a gallon sized plant. Good to go. We drive there and find the rose bush but it is listed as $44.99. So we go to the front and say that  we had called and driven 30 minutes to get this rose and we were told "Oops...sometimes the  prices on my list up front right". No sh!t Sherlock. So...will you honor the price quoted? NO. So we drove down the street to A And P Nursery on Baseline west of Lindsay and got the same size plant that they were selling for $44.99 for $16.99. Don't waste your time with these rip-off artists.~~#~0
I'm in love. Bacon you have my heart and my stomach. After all- where else does everything come with one of my favorite foods attached to it? Even my Bloody Mary had a slice of crisp bacon in it along with a celery spear, olives and onions. Probably one of the best Bloody Mary's I have had in awhile. The location is a little off the beaten path which is why, I think, people are lined up to get in the Breakfast Club a couple of blocks away for mediocre food, and here at Bacon- the food and service is better and there was no line on the Sunday I was there. I was seated in what they call "the nook" located on the side where I had full view of the restaurant. The menu was well organized and entrees come with toast and breakfast potatoes and your choice of a side of bacon or ham. You can also substitute fresh tomatoes if that is your wish. The food came up quickly and was delicious! My ham and cheese omelet was perfectly done (all melted cheese and ham inside and firm eggs on the outside) and the side of bacon was crisp and tasty. Given the size, this easily was a 4 egg omelet. Breakfast with drinks ran about $20 which was cheap for all the food I got. But I would be remiss if I didn't talk about what really blew me away about this place. It's the fantastic service! Everyone seems to be part of a larger team. I was greeted by one person, seated by another and had at least three servers taking care of me. And countless people stopped by to ask how things were, if I needed more water for my tea, or if I wanted more preserves for my toast. It was unbelievable! While they have been open for 9 months- they had the staff of a place that has been open much longer. The ambiance is contemporary but is warmed up by the blue booths, checkered table cloths, and some mismatched dining tables in the center that can be expanded for larger groups. There are also antique food cases lining the walls filled with tins of chocolate, and other food "cues". I also liked that they have those "roll up" doors on the one side that bring the outdoors in and seats outside on those perfect days. If I lived in Scottsdale- this would be my "go to" brunch place. What I don't get is why people are waiting in line at a place around the corner that left me a little cold. C'mon people. If you haven't checked Bacon out- you should. After all- what's not to like about, Bacon?~~#~1
What can I say ?  This is awesome.  I am a donut fan and would give Dunkin 4 stars, just like this place.  Great variety, great coffee, fresh donuts.  The extra 1 star comes for the fluffiness of their dough.  Its very fluffy and its done just right.  Dunkin is good but its donuts will taste a little hard and "old" when they have been sitting for a while.  For some reason, the Bosa donuts dun get too hard, even after U buy and drive for like 1/2 hour home.  I know its not located in the best part of town, but they are open 24 hrs and there is a drive thru.  They accept credit cards and discover :)~~#~1
OK OK... as a Proud Italian I hope my momma don't see this! I'm actually going to give D'moes a 5 star rating for a few reasons. Last Friday, me and my 2 brothers left the suns game, and proceed to put a few "adult" beverages back. At around 2am, when Haney's shut down, we had an overwhelming craving for crap pizza (its better than our normal Jack in Box at 3am run that usually ends up with someone puking in the drive thru line because the smell of the taco sauce is so amazing). Low and behold, the ONLY spot that was still taking orders (up to 2am!) was D'moes. Now, 1st off - I live at Summitt (by BOB). These guys gladly delivered to me, all the way down there! Major props for that. 2 - They understood me... considering I don't remember ordering the pizza (I woke up to pizza and wings boxes all over my pad, and me saying "who ordered pizza" then I burped... wing sauce and vodka is a healthy combo. 3 - apparently, after checking my voice mail, the driver was pounding on our door for about 5 minutes (we were REALLY jamming out to Rock Band, in case you don't know, were pretty awesome. Wikipedia that Ish ladies and Gent's; Kansas City Bullriders). Well, the driver and my door man both called 3 times. I'm assuming the driver eventually came in and grabbed the bass guitar and strummed it out. Maybe he had a slice with us? Who really knows these things. However, I do know that I was insanely impressed with D'moes... from the left overs I ate the next when I could remember. It was pretty darn good. Between the awesome'ness that is called "their customer service" and the legit taste it left in my mouth, I'm a believer, unless, if I say I'm not, will I get a commercial?... hmmmm.... Potential there....~~#~1
I decided to try qwest as I was tired of Cox continually raising their rates.BAD CALL! Cox may cost a little more but is completely worth it. If I wasn't locked in to a BS contract I would switch back right now.Internet: I signed up for their "Heavy Duty" internet @ 20 Mbps. I regularly test less than 2Mbps on dslreports.com. The best I have ever seen is a little over 5. When I call to try and get it fixed they tell me there is no guarantee on speeds. That is why they advertise "up to" 20 Mbps...Phone: Extremely poor sound quality, very loud static and crackling, shocking as this is what they should be good at. I called to complain they explained we would have to pay to have technician look at it. This was the day after install!! Helpful hint, call back and tell them you want to cancel your account. The customer loyalty group is actually decent, they sent out a tech free of charge. He fixed it after a couple of hours, but acted completely put out that we wanted a clear line...The bundle: Ah my favorite part and what has finally pushed me over the edge to submit a review...  I went with a bundled package (phone, cable, internet). The plan I signed up for was $147 a month. The first bill was $147, the second bill in I'm at $272.43. I can't make any sense out of the bill so I'm not sure why they think i owe this much. I love the fact that I will get the pleasure of wasting another hour plus of my day tomorrow talking to these fools. The day this contract is up I'm going back to Cox and I'll be happy to pay more!!~~#~0
I've been boycotting this store since 2009.  One afternoon after browsing for a while with my kids, I allowed my 10yo and 8yo to stay in the children's section to pick out a book to spend their allowance money on while I ran next door to TJ Maxx to buy the toddler a pair of shoes.  I'd been gone 30 minutes when I returned to find the horrid lady in the children's section had called the police on us.  She never asked the kids  their ages and didn't ask if they had a way to reach me (they did).  The police talked to them, realized they were perfectly well behaved consumers, and assured me I'd done nothing illegal.  Avoid like the plague.~~#~0
Went here one night with a group of friends. This place is pink, crowded, and really not that impressive. I ordered some sorbet and it was bland - that in itself is an accomplishment - bland sorbet.  The 50's style booth seats were very uncomfortable (maybe to discourage staying long?) and the tables were the wrong height for eating. I had to strain to get above face level of my food (and i'm a normal sized woman) It was also very very (very) loud in here.I'll avoid going here again. The quality of the product was just too poor - I'd rather hit up a Whole Foods and get some good sorbet without the discomfort and echoing nosie.~~#~0
This is my favorite fine dining in town.  I only go here 2 or 3 times a year because it's a little pricey for dinner, but wow, what great food!  Dessert is awesome here too, love the Sundae.  I just went here for my birthday last week and it still lives up to expectations although they don't carry my favorite anymore (double cut grilled pork chop).  They might start carrying it after they move to their new location though, here's hoping!  If you're looking for a classy place with great dinner dishes then this place is highly recommended, just please dress accordingly and don't try wearing a hat, not allowed!~~#~1
This is a real find and I mean "find"  because it is tucked away on the side streets of downtown Glendale. This small little restaurant is unique in decor and cuisine, not many polish restaurants around.  The food is flavorful and fresh, the soups are unique and tasty.  The stuffed bell peppers are awesome as is the stew.The owners are warm and inviting without being overbearing.  My only disappointment is the limited hours, I work too far away to get there for lunch and they are only open a few nights a week.  Definitely worth the trip.~~#~1
I don't get it. This place is crazy busy with no Manager in sight and in hiding during the busy dinner hour. No name tags on the employees. I was scolded for pointing over the sneeze glass to the sauce that I wanted since nothing was labeled. I guess I violated the health code. Thanks for not locking me up. I told my family we will not spend one more dime here.~~#~0
Lee Lee's finally expanded from their Chandler location for us who have loyally driven an hour to shop. Low prices, huge selection, and it only took like a week for the place to smell like a true Asian market (i.e., wherever you are, you will never escape the smell of fish).I love it. I bought ingredients for Vietnamese spring rolls, two different kinds of curries, a new motor/pestle, a Vietnamese coffee press, and some various other vegetables and liquors... hardly anything. Also, the seafood, while I didn't purchase any, looks very fresh.Wonderful to see such a great addition to west Phoenix.~~#~1
I have been coming to Lux for years ever since I started graduate school here in AZ.  What is there to say that hasn't already been said other than hands down it is my go-to coffee spot in Arizona.  Such a warm and diverse group of people, rotating artwork, the perfect study music playing in the background (although it is played a bit loud), espresso roasted on-site and baked goods made on-site.  Always find an excuse to end up there for a café au lait or a velvet if I have a sweet tooth!~~#~1
I am in love with Yogurtland fro yo!!  It is super delicious and inexpensive!!  I got the coconut and added shredded coconut and mochi pieces...yummm.   Can't wait to go back.~~#~1
I LOVE LOVE LOVE Paws Salon. I used to take my dog to Canine Preferred but the ladies at the front dest were flakey, so I thought I'd try a new place and I am SO glad I did. The owner Tracy clearly has a passion for animals. Walking in you are greeted by a cat, dog, and Macaw that call the front of the shop home. You are able to see them grooming the dogs (a big plus for me, you never know what some places do behind closed doors). She is very professional and seems like a no bullshit kind of lady (in a good way). She's to the point, tries to listen to exactly what you want and offers options and suggestions to help. They keep track of the previous cut that was given (it's annoying some places you to have to tell them every time). I would highly recommend this pet salon. They also offer daycare, and overnight boarding. I can't want to try the daycare to socialize my pup some more! Can't go wrong at this salon..~~#~1
A roadtrip would not be complete without local BBQ and Bobby's does not disappoint!Fancy smancy table serviceDark and cool with bar seatingRotisserie chick and bragging about the ribs. Alex was friendly and rattled off drink specials. Other servers were chatting with friends at the bar and one, blond one dipped into her cleavage for something. I hope she washes her hands before serving up a meal. Now I look around, this is a breaking ground for hooters. Low cut and falling out. Not a fan of that. Bobby Q Amber Ale (Sonoran Brewing) is too light with a bitter bite. Not my type of amber but they tried. 2 meats, brisket & sausage w/ mac&cheese and...the pecan coleslaw? What the heck for $18.  Pulled pork sandwich $102 meat with pork and brisket Ranch House SaladCorn bread (pucks) of sweet, warm goodness.Sides were great! The beans with zest, the M&C takes me back to old school cafeteria, the potato salad was fantastic and the slaw was great with the pecan. Brisket was the clear winner from the table and we all loved the smoky sausage. The pulled pork was a disappointing third as it was dry. Good thing I went with brisket. Two thumbs up here kids. Well worth your time and money. Yelp check in brought a 10% off the total tab too.~~#~1
Say hello to the Ghost Lounge, folks. This is a brand new bar located right next to Seamus, within the San Carlos through an agreement with the hotel's ownership. For years, I've thought the Hotel San Carlos was an under-appreciated (through its own fault) downtown venue. With the Ghost, the owner has finally executed a plan to revive its rightful place on the downtown Phoenix scene. This is apparent from the first step inside the lobby, which appears as it did in 1928 when the hotel first opened. If celebrities in the 1930s had to spend the night in Phoenix, back then a small, un-airconditioned cowboy town with around 50,000, they would have stayed here. (Or else the near-by Westward Ho). You get a taste of those times with the massive photographic blow-ups the Ghost has put up on its walls of various scenes from early 20th century downtown Phoenix. So large that you can zero in on individual pedestrians on the streets, and marvel at their bowties, cowboy hats, handkerchiefs and facial expressions. Back then, the San Carlos was probably one of the only places in town that was "air-cooled." (That may have meant it had swamp coolers. I haven't googled the history of air conditioning technology for this review.)I'd describe the bar's style as grandiose, and classic old school Phoenix with an obligatory hint of Chicago (obligatory given the decades-old economic relationship betweeen the two cities that endures to this day). It has been beautifully done. I will be back often.~~#~1
Saigon Pho doesn't have a fancy sign, great decor or even windows you can look in/out of. But who cares when you have the most amazing Pho in the valley (and at the best prices)? The servings are very big and everything averages about $6 a plate. Staff is very attentive and quick to deliver the goods.As you can read through the various other reviews - everyone has a favorite dish. I have a problem with gluttony so I can't suggest a single dish - I can only suggest them all. However, this place also has some of the best Salt and Pepper calamari I've ever had.~~#~1
Great staff without an attitude (which is rare in Scottsdale).  As I was waiting for my party to arrive, I was sitting outside drinking my beer and eating my food.  Without ANY questions and/or hassle, my bill was transferred inside when my party arrived.  Not only that, but our waiter remember exactly what I had and was able to split it without me even asking him to do so.  OK, how great is that?  I am totally sold on the service there an  I will definitely come back.  Very nice unpretentious place.~~#~1
I'll never forget my first Urban Cookie. I was checking out after a successful day of shopping at Frances (my favorite boutique), when the girl behind the counter offered me some cookies they had out on a tray. I hesitated at first (because I was worried about fitting the new skinny jeans I had just bought) but gave in after little persuasion.It was love at first bite. After buying my jeans, I rushed immediately to Urban Cookie and bought one of every kind. Although it was close, Urban Trail was my favorite. I really can't help myself, I keep going back for more (plus the owner is super cute). I love urban cookie!~~#~1
This is thee place to indulge your sweet tooth. Great ice cream and ice cream creations from an establishment with deep roots and long pedigree in the ice cream biz.  Just can't be beat.~~#~1
Another visit: Greeeeeeat carne asada tacos, torta and that orange cake! Quesadillas, pork and chicken, were a great balance of cheese, meat and sauce.That orange cake though?! Like, I am one of those people that would do ...things for good carrot cake, and the basic format of carrot cake done with oranges, cream cheese icing and all, was a wonderful flavor surprise. Gallo Blanco looks like a top contender for Places to Take Visitors. Just a very well rounded place to give visitors a taste of good eats in Phoenix and examples of well done and delish Mexican cuisine.~~#~1
Yummy!~~#~1
My girlfriend i love, love, love this place. Excellent food, beers, and wine to enjoy on premises.   Friendly, helpful, and funny staff.  A wonderful grocery to shop from, and an amazing selection of cheese and wine.  It's a total foodie destination.  This place is fantastic.  Ahwahtukee (and Phoenix in general) needs more quality driven, food and wine centric places like this.~~#~1
I love Honey Bear's!  I've been visiting their restaurants for years.  I've been to the one on Van Buran, the one on Central and this one in Tempe.  They have the runniest sauce on earth but dang it tastes great!  I love the pulled pork sandwiches but not the long lines at lunch.  When I went after 1pm in the afternoon I stood in a line of one - me.~~#~1
My favorite place in the world to eat! Great service and awesome food!~~#~1
Love this place! I went with my Grandma and Aunt on a Thursday afternoon. The weather was great but just a tad windy so we sat inside. First I like the layout of this place, very open and airy. There are 2 outside patios one street level and then one upstairs. I actually have been here twice so far. First time was just for a mid afternoon cocktail with one of my stylists. The servers were very friendly and our concoction of vodka, grapefruit and cranberry juice was the perfect blend. The second time we ordered 3 small plates to share, ahi tacos, artichoke and spinach dip and the mussels. All three were heavenly and very reasonably priced. The ahi was fresh and chilled, perfect for a warm day. The artichoke dip was different than any I have had before, gooey cheesy goodness that we gobbled up practically licking the bowl. The chips that accompanied the did were fresh and perfectly salted, even when the dip was done we still polished off the chips. The mussels were in a perfect white wine sauce but the stars of this dish were the mussels themselves. Buttery and melt in your mouth good, not chewy at all with no grit, to most common problem I find. The broth was so good I let the bread marinate at the bottom of the bowl, soaking up the juice. My martini was a generous pour and even though they were out of blue cheese stuff olives the bartender took the time to stuff some and deliver it to our table. Now on to the staff, all are a good looking lot but they are also skilled. All of our food and drinks were delivered in a timely manner by our lovely server Jennifer. We also met one of the sous chefs, Lennie. A charming fellow with stunning blue eyes, my grandmother remarked on them, a playful Mohawk and tattoos peaking out of his uniform. He swears that the sweet potato fries are some of the best in town and sent over a complimentary bucket. I do believe he is right, cooked to perfection, slightly crisp on the outside, warm and soft on the inside dusted with fresh herbs and I believe Parmesan cheese. After our meal the manager came over to make sure everything was to our liking. RnR is another great place within walking distance from my salon and I am looking forward to trying everything on their menu. If all the items are as wonderful as the first 3 I tried I am in for a treat!~~#~1
This is one of my favorite places to eat when I get back to town.  Their beans are the best I've had.  Their tacos are made of shredded beef and fried with the fillings inside.  This makes the best product.  All of you lucky enough to live in the state don't realize how lucky you are to have this treat!  I'm usually not an enchilada fan, but you have to try one here.Some of the reviews comment on decor.  While it is true the place is a little shabby and the salsa comes in squeeze bottles, I would much rather have their cheap prices than fine china.  And that salsa, I really would be tempted to steal one of those bottles, but then I'd have to check it in my bag to go back home!~~#~1
The line was ridiculous.  The price is kind of steep for what it is.  The dog is kind of messy because of the way it's made.  But you know what?  I enjoyed it in a way I haven't enjoyed a hot dog in years!  Wow, that sounds kind of dirty.  This really is a unique take on one of the most common American foods.I passed through the sea of trucks and people that is Food Truck Fridays on a mission to finally try the much yelped about Short Leash Dogs.  I can't say much too much that hasn't already been said.  While the 20 minute wait wasn't too thrilling, it all paid off in the end.  I just went with a traditional wiener, with tomatoes, onion, relish and spicy mustard.  While I was intrigued to try some of Short Leash Dog's specialties, most of the dogs on today's menu contained an item or two that I don't really like, and I wanted to compare Short Leash Dogs to what I am accustomed to the first time around.  Good sausage, good toppings and the flat bread is fantastic. I would happily join Lindsey F. by tying my leash to the cart and following them around town.  And I didn't even know that I still enjoyed hot dogs that much without a beer and a game!~~#~1
The staff is friendly and knowledgable and the sales on stationary are always welcome.  Lots of specialty papers to purchase by the sheet or in packs of 25 or 50, with matching envelopes.  Oh so easy to give just the right touch to my correspondance.Even when they are swamped with business the staff is always ready to lend a hand or help with a jammed machine.When my puter is down I rent one of theirs for just $10 and hour with printing priveleges.~~#~1
I went to Z Tejas with a bunch of people (about 25) last night.  We had a great experience from start to finish.  At the beginning my lady and I were early so the waiter got us our drinks and continued to make sure we were good to go.  We wanted to wait for our friends so food wasn't necessary at this time, but the drinks were flowing and the waiter (Jeff) was very cool, friendly, and down to earth.  All of our friends showed up and we let the good times roll.  Chips and salsa, drinks, water, and the delicious cornbread, they all came very fast and it didn't take any begging on our part.  I got a chicken dish which was really good, I stuffed myself silly.  My lady got a side salad which was huge, she couldn't even finish it and she said it was really good.  Oh! and the food came fast by the way (surprising when you have 25 people.The overall vibe of the place is really cool, very trendy and fancy but reasonable prices.  Big screens everywhere, gotta love that since there were some great College FB games on last night.  Great experience, thanks Jeff & Z Tejas.~~#~1
Amazing food. I wasn't so sure about Indian food, as visiting this place was my first time at both the restaurant and the food itself. I had the Chicken Tikki Marsala and it was fantastic. I can't wait to go back!~~#~1
This is a great little authentic Mexican restaurant - don't let the looks fool you, it is delicious!  I had the Tampiquena, it is one of the best I have had.  Highly recommended~~#~1
Great food!  Great atmosphere! Great service.  Definitely recommend!!~~#~1
This is a dangerous place for me. I could seriously do my bank account some damage as I love love love this store! The candles are the best anywhere. They burn very clean and the fragrance lasts until they burn out. I just bought the kumquat scented candles and they smell delish. There's so many cool home furnishings here as well, unique non-mainstream stuff that's fairly reasonable in $$. I've actually got my eye on this really cool apothecary cabinet... purchasing it may be in my very near future!~~#~1
The consummate beer bar.  Great selection, knowledgeable bartenders and eclectic patrons.  What more can you want from a drinking establishment?  The food is good too.~~#~1
Service at this location is superb and worth the wait when they are busy. Price and selection are awesome too!~~#~1
I have played this course two times now.  From the moment you pull up, you feel like you are at a private course.  The staff is very friendly and professional.  The views are breathtaking and both times I have played, the course has been in impecable shape!  The course is challenging, but still enjoyable.  Lots of holes that are down hill (great for long tee shots!).  This is one of my favorite courses in the area!~~#~1
I liked this place. The reviews show low stars but I liked it. I was there for happy hour so go at that time. The pricing is good. I don't know about dinner, but happy hour is cool.  Servers were chill.  Host was a bit stuck up. Not sure why she though she was that great. But the place is cool. I recommend people check it out if they want to try a sushi place on the Mill ave when you are in town visiting Tempe.~~#~1
My g/f love sushi! She made me a connosiuer of it. and I have to be critical. So many college kids "love" RA, but it's mediocre at best.I'll just list a few things that irk me:I went during a happy hour with co-workers. It was PACKED. Good thing, right? WRONG!Extremely poor service. when I went in to meet coworkers who already had a table the hostess told me I have to wait. When I said I have a table, she got in my face. I was tired, long-day and I wanted to chill. I walked past her, found my friends, and she left me alone.The waitress took quite a bit of time to get around to my table, and the sushi servings were OBVIOUSLY LOW!I went to Zen 32, and now my choice is SakeBomber. their happy hour servings are much more than RA, and their prices are BETTER!Be ready for loud noises, as every one is trying to talk louder than the music, and the person next to them.Just an overall poor experience. and I tip on service. Food quality was so-so. Just don't go during a happy hour, which is the only time it's worth it because it's priced so high.~~#~0
I love this gym! Everyone is so helpful and friendly. The gym has a TON of equipment and is always very well kept and clean. I wouldn't want to go anywhere else. I feel very well connected to all of the staff - they even know me by name! The trainers are extremely helpful also. I would recommend this gym to anyone and everyone!~~#~1
Kick @$$ The Best of the bertos & they will make anything you want_!! Carne Asada with Sausage & Ham........Wow..~~#~1
I love this place! It first caught my eye driving to work.  Their logo includes a shazzam lighting bolt which is rad if your into comics. I went in the place and they had comic art on the walls. The staff made some suggestions of what I should try. I got the slider pizza - (kinda like a cheese burger pizza) they actually used a little brown mustard on top. Anyway it was delicious. I can't get over the helpful staff though. It is very rare that I get that kind of service at a pizza joint.Any way every time I have visited the place there has been no patrons and it breaks my heart because that is a good sign that it isn't going to be around long. If you get the change PLEASE check this place out.~~#~1
Favorite Pho in the phoenix area so far.  Great, tender meat in my pho chin nam (#8).I see they also have bun bo hue on the menu so I'll have to try that sometime soon.    Nom nom.Friendly staff.See ya there!~~#~1
Alright this is the deal of deals, 2.75 for students and Im not sure if its a quarter more or not, but less 4 dollars. half an ice cream cookie sandwiches, trust me its enough.  Its a great pick me up for something sweet on millCookies are made their along with the good ice cream, and if your not into that they have italian ice.Place is small, but is packed with flavor, and smells like fresh cookies.Recommendation: If you love cookies made into sandwiches~~#~1
Bad food, but lots of it.  If you have a hangover and need grease, this is your place.  Other than that, drive a block and eat at Mucho Gusto down the street--now that is real mexican food!~~#~0
Stopped in for Margs and appetizers.Had 2 house Margaritas......AM I DRUNK?Holy MOLY what do they put in those things?Food was great, drinks were better, I'll be back!~~#~1
You can't give anything less than 5 stars to a place that sells bra's and panties to hot chicks.~~#~1
I've been to the locations in Chandler and Mesa and one word describes both locations: Fresh.  Their donuts are consistently soft and fresh.~~#~1
We came there on November 5, 2011 and the service was very bad. The worst I have ever seen and we were treated like shit. We came into town from LA and Vegas for the NFL game and seen Mrs. White's cafe on Foodnet Work and knew the food had to be great. The chicken was great, but the customer service was so bad we will never return again.  We got a refill on our drinks and the guy poured sum of our drinks on the left overs so we could not take our food back to the hotel. Foodnet Work shame on you for recommending this place. Just because the chicken is good, does not mean you treat people like shit. We had to remind the staff over six times to get our order. We waited over 40 minutes to get the other 3 pieces of chicken to finish our meal. We don't mind waiting but it was pretty rude when you are watching other peolple are getting their meals when they walked in after us. The Mac and Cheese did not look like everyone else's order- it look like it came out of a box. You can tell it was far from homemade, it cleary was not bake, no crust. The gravy was watered, missing favor. Corn bread was over cooked under salted. The cornbread sure as  hell did not look like everyones else's cornbread. I felt like we received the leftovers. Truly the worst service we ever received. The place needs to learn how to be respectful and just be nice.~~#~0
Best donuts in the valley.I like a variety of donuts (my favorites, though are raised sugar and raised glaze), and all the donuts here are great.  Never too heavy, always tasting fresh.~~#~1
Pulled pork over rice with compelling seasoned tater tots (rosemary & garlic).  Gutsy sauce was utterly unique!  Darryl King prepared it hot and packaged it with style for takeaway service.~~#~1
I think everyone has said most everything that needs to be said about this place. But I'll highlight the reasons I frequent Switch...free wi-figood drinks$5 recession plate special - that is always as awesome as the rest of their menugood happy hour specialsopen til 11pm 7 days a weekgood wine great/friendly wait stafftheir salads are out of control - amazing.i think i could happily support/invest in switch/fez/ticoz dynasty for all of eternity...if i had the means.~~#~1
Fast, friendly, and clean.  You don't get to say that too often when describing a post office!  Serously though, these guys are great.~~#~1
Papago Park is a great place to ride (bicycles, that is).  The terrain can be as easy or as hard as you'd like-- just choose your trail!~~#~1
Ordered the famous "Butter Burger" medium rare. Forget lettuce, tomato, and pickle, eat this with cheese and maybe some ketchup to let that beef shine through. Delicious! Great diner atmosphere, got to sit at the counter.Happy to see it was Niman Ranch beef, a sustainable/organic livestock provider.~~#~1
My wife and I as well as several of our friends drive from Ahwatukee on a regular basis to dine at Flo's on Thompson Peak and Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd. 25 miles isn't too far for this food. We've been eating here since the 90's and have always been pleased. I discovered it when I worked in the area and used to stand in line for lunch, it was so busy. Our favorites: Lemon Pepper Chicken with extra lemon wedges and the Kung Pow although I can't think of anything I wouldn't order.~~#~1
"Yogurtland" as I say it with a high-pitched tone in the end..This is my ultimate favorite dessert!! I would give 10 stars if Yelp allows it! All my friends know that I am attached to this place! We started this craziness together with my better half when we tried it a few years back after a basketball game...and all I said after first walking in was, "This is fun!!" and we got hooked eversince!! That I collect their spoons, only used by me and the hubbie, and I now have 5 YGL  cups full of spoons!! I am the ultimate Yogurtland addict!! heehee We go as often as 5 times a week that we already know the staff in this location. And we go that often that we even tried to abstain from it for Lent just to see if we can resist it!! haha Most of our friends also keep on asking to try other fro yo places to see if something will beat my YGL addiction..and so far nothing has won over it yet..=DSo, my favorite flavors are Taro, Pistachio and Toasted Coconut and the of course the seasonal flavors, Pumpkin Pie, Gingerbread..Oh I wanna go now just thinking about it! My favorite toppings are the yogurt chips, sugar cone, sunflower seeds, shredded coconut and graham!!  =) Perfect blend of flavors! So if you haven't tried it yet, grab your favorite partner and enjoy some "Yogurtland"...=)~~#~1
Sara (bartender) is the hottest chick in the world!!~~#~1
I love love this store!! Their reduced fat chicken salad and pasedena salads are to die for. The prepackaged frozen meals are also yummy! My daughter loves their yogurt and premade pasta meals. Their clif bars are 1/2 the price as supermarkets!! The employees are extremely nice and helpful. I would SO recommend this store to any and every one!!~~#~1
I rarely go to Indian restaurants. But this is a place I love to visit often. The food seems as if it was done with great interest. When u go there, order anything with rice. They cook it to perfection. I like their handi dishes a lot.If there is one thing I can suggest, it is that they should stop adding food coloring to some of their dishes. No need to guild this Lilly!~~#~1
I am a vegetarian and there is a ton of great stuff at Pita Jungle. I just had the hummus trio, babaganoush, dolmas, mozzarella, and feta for appetizers tonight. Fantastic happy hour on the apps and delicious. Took BLACK BEAN BURGER to go. SOOOO good! Also, servers are super nice and prompt. YAY!~~#~1
All I have to say is what you see on the menu is not what you're gonna get. and if you're ok with cockroaches on the walls and floors, the this is the place to eat.~~#~0
I've always wanted a family friendly jeweler.  Esp. if my at the time boyfriend was going to buy me an engagement ring.  It means so much to me to have the true customer service when buying fine Jewelry, someone I can trust.  And when I found this place one day while I was at CVS I knew I had found a Gem (pun intended)! Peggy really made me and my now finance feel like we were family.  She helped him pick out my fabulous ring and answer every single one of his questions.  I'm so proud to tell everyone where we got the ring from because I think everyone should know about this place!  If your looking for great jewelry with a warm smile, head on over.  They are so excited to help you!~~#~1
If you've never had or even heard of bingsoo you NEED to check this place out. I have two friends who were constantly bantering about bingsoo and this Fresco place. I was excited when I found out it was so close to my house. If you've never heard of it, this is how it goes down. It's a layer of shaved ice, then you have your choice of ice cream or FF frozen yogurt, your choice of fresh fruit off the menu (apples, strawberry, mango, banana kiwi and many others) and then your choice of "sauce" which is a fruit puree of either strawberry, kiwi or mango and honey. You mix it all together and there you have it. A somewhat healthy dessert! They even have a frequent bingsoo buyers card =) This place isn't just all about the bingsoo though. They have a menu of fresh sandwiches and fruit juices too!~~#~1
Went here last night when on our last night staying at the Hotel Valley Ho.  We were able to walk there from the hotel and it was so cute.  The wait staff were helpful and gracious.  Once we saw how large the pizzas were, they accomodated us and split the toppings on each side of the pizza so we got what we wanted.  I did think the olives were really salty, but that's that type of olive.  We had delicious wine and the bruschetta sampler.  Enjoy people!~~#~1
I have to tell you....I had their Jerk Chicken Plate the other night, and it was yuuuuummmmmyyy! You gotta try it!~~#~1
I love this place the more I go to it! The service is completely out of the ordinary for fast food and now they have something called, Mexican Gumbo. Holy schneikies it's good!!! Can't beat the prices either! If I had a choice of this place over Chipotle, I would choose Qdoba ANY day!!!~~#~1
Quick, friendly, awesome.~~#~1
we only came across this place because an acquaintance recommended it to us. I've lived up the street from this place for years and never knew it existed, it's quite the hole in the wall and easy to pass by.The place was super clean and the owners did a wonderful job serving everyone in a timely manner and being super attentive. We felt so taken care of!! :) I thought the prices were a little on the high side but when they brought out our meal all I could say was "WHOAH!". The portion sizes were CRAZY awesome and my hubby and I could have really split one entree and still had some leftover. The food was fresh, the meat tender, the atmosphere pleasantly divine! 2 trips now and I'm such a fan! :D~~#~1
We love The Olive Tree! We call it 'the grill' We eat there at least once a week - my littlest one has swim lessons right next door. Both my picky eaters love eating there! We love the chicken kabobs and the chicken shwarma(sp?). Family ran, great food we love it!~~#~1
Mucho Gusto es mucho mierda. Let me say first, that the place is cute, the staff is friendly, and the salsa is good. There. I'm not being a total jerk. The food, however, left much to be desired. I couldn't find much to like about my chicken tacos- they were ok, but the meat didn't have much flavor, there was no cheese, and they were pretty stingy with the guacamole and pico. What really got me was that they didn't come with rice and beans. Instead, I got a lovely pile of cheap bagged romaine coated in some sort of caesar-ish dressing. Sure, there were a few cubes of cheese and a tomato slice (A slice!) on top, but come on. $14 for a couple of naked tacos and a pile of romaine? For that much, they could have at least picked the white core parts of the lettuce out of my salad. Or, I dunno, sprinkled a little cheese on the tacos?The story was much the same with the fish tacos, only the salad was different. The enchiladas seemed to be a hit, and those are served with rice and beans. the vegan at the table ordered a side of rice and beans for her meal, and they aren't kidding about it being a side. I think my cat's food bowl is bigger. They charge $1 per bowl if you want more chips. I know $1 isn't a big deal, but it's just the principle. I already felt ripped off from the entree, so the extra charge for the chips just made it worse. Needless to say, I won't be going back. There are far better choices closer to home.~~#~0
10:30pm on a Saturday night.  My friend and I try our second attempt at sushi for the night (see my review of Pearl for the first).  Place is hopping.  We take a seat at the sushi bar.The Waitress:  "Are you girls going to be ordering sushi?"Me: I have a sushi menu in my hand, "yes."Waitress:  "Would you mind putting it in soon because they want to go home too."Me: What the fuck, bitch. "Uh, ok"Dear Ra Waitress,I'm sorry if I kept you or any other employess, especially since I finished eating my roll before your kitchen even closed.  It was completely ok to rush me, even though I had no intention of staying all fucking night and even though plenty of new sushi orders came after mine.  I was hardly the last customer in there.  There were people all around me ordering sushi, so I'm still unclear as to why you needed to rush me.  If you were in such a hurry- why did it take you longer to bring and process my bill than it did for me to eat your food?  Maybe it was because you don't know how to count, since you gave the wrong amount of change and I ended up having to tell you the correct amount since you couldn't count it on the spot.  I like Ra for the atmosphere, something you completely ruined.  Thanks for that.   Sincerely,Morgan~~#~0
Of course, they are no La Madeliene, but if you are looking for some good croissants, this is the place to be. I love, love, love their croissants. But which bakery's croissants do I not love? hmm... But I do love theirs. I have had the almond croissant, the almond and chocolate croissant and finally today when we went there, I had the chocolate croissant. It was just freaking amazing. That's all I can say. (They run out of the chocolate almond croissants pretty quickly so go early if you want some)I have also had lunch here before, some Mediterranean sandwich stuff. The portion is very small compared to the price. Their macaroons look crazy and funky. Have not tried them yet but plan on doing so next time. I almost gave them 4 stars because their hours they are open are very weird. But its okay, I will compromise Essence Bakery. They only use butter imported from Normandy in their Croissants. Wow.~~#~1
Went early  to North for the New Year's eve special menu. 3rd time dining here. They did not have to have great service or food on a yearly event, but as with the previous meals, it was outstanding. Hubby had the misto fritto, they always do the crisp calamari perfect. Enough just to make a special trip for it. I had the beef carpaccio, buttery and flavorful. The apple cider pork tenderloin was tender, moist and it was a huge portion. My hubby was stuffed but did not stop eating until it was all gone. Oink. I had the scallops. Always a favorite of mine. They usually have it on the menu and often in a variation as a special. We both had the hazelnut chocolate cake. Sinfully rich. We were both too full to eat but a bite and finished at home for the New Year's countdown. We really enjoy our dining at North and have been very fortunate at several other Fox restaurants.~~#~1
I was in Vietnam last May, and spent every summer in Westminster CA growing up, so to qualify my 5 stars, "Woohoo! As good as it gets!"  I say to what's available of what I've seen in PHX area.  With that said, I've had the Bun Bo Hue, Pho Tai, Com Tam Dac Biet, Bun bi cha gio, and agree with what everyone said about cleanliness, freshness of condiments, integrity of broth ( lack of oiliness ), and general flavor.  The only thing that didn't rock my world was the bahn mi sandwiches- can't vouch for the assorted outsourced items in the chilled section either.  Besides that, If you want Viet food this is your place for the PHX metro area.~~#~1
Staff was quick and efficient. Food was delicious.~~#~1
I tired they chicken smash burger.... WOOHOO!!!  LOVE IT!  Crispy chicken (not too think, not too thick) but perfectly crispy.  I ordered the build your own:  Egg bun, crispy chicken, mayo, and swiss cheese.  HELLO MAMA!  The smash fries were good.  The staff is always friendly.~~#~1
My significant other had a $25 off coupon from Restaurant.com LOL. That could sum up the whole trip. I haven't been to many restaurants that participate with restaurant.com that are decent at all. I mean, I wasn't expecting much coming into this place, I shouldn't have expected anything here.I was in the mood for some red meat, and sushi places do actually have decent dishes like teriyaki chicken and stuff like that sometimes. So, I didn't mind checking this place out since I do like a little bit of sushi on the side. The boolgogee, plain, simply plain. There was a salad with the boolgogee, but it too was plain. There wasn't nearly enough meat to warrant a price tag of $8, because the salad and rice probably didn't cost more than $0.50 to make.Oh, the sushi? All of the sushi we happened to get were either super plain or super spicy. By spicy, I mean that there were just too many tastes going on at the same time and it was too overwhelming. I tried a few bites of the 3-4 different rolls we got. After I tried each roll I thought that I liked it but that the taste was too overwhelming for me to want to try another bite. We paid $18 for the food even after the coupon, and I honestly think that even at the price it might be a bit of a rip off considering you can get cheaper, higher quality sushi at Teharu.This place is a rip-off for sushi in my opinion. Its not good enough to warrant the hefty price tag. The sad part is that the interior is very well done, if the food was actually good this place would be extremely interesting.~~#~0
I stop here every Monday night and negate two hours of spinning and yoga by indulging in Mexican comfort food. My wife swears by the carne asado tacos; the cheese enchiladas ring my bell. Although I phone in my order, the parking lot is always an adventure. However, the one night a young Hispanic girl celebrating her birthday in the restaurant's limited outdoor sitting area insisted I come over for a glass of milk and slice of her cake negated all the encounters with strange transients.~~#~1
Pei Wei's has nothing on the fabulous food at TOTTS  The menu is awesome -- try anything!!  The owner, Young, is such a nice man and will always help you understand the menu or make recommendations.  In fact, one time we told him we wished a certain dish was spicier (we really like hotttt food), and he told us to just ask next time we were in and they would make it spicier.  Everything on the menu is fabulous, but some of my favorites are:Sweet and Pungent Chicken -- all time favoriteBourban ChickenTwins Pork~~#~1
As far as I know, I'm the only person in this town that has a dish named after them. I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure I'm right. I mean, I'm always right.By now, if you read my reviews, you know that I am vegan and I don't eat gluten. This makes dining out quite an issue at times, especially for breakfast/brunch. I really wanted to hit up The Vig Uptown for brunch because I like it as a Happy Hour spot, the space is incredible, it is within a bike ride from my house, and I love the Original Vig, but alas, there was nothing on the menu to accommodate me. I gently mentioned in person and a few times on FaceBook that having some sort of tofu scrambler would really improve their menu.They listened.They created.They named. (after me!!!)We stopped by for brunch this past Sunday for the dishes debut, and got a personal hello from Tucker. He was excited because they had already sold TEN AMber Scramblers that morning and it isn't even officially on the menu yet! I'm already a star!So, whats the verdict on the AMber Scrambler? Amazing. Seriously. The thing that really sets this apart from other scrambler dishes is sun dried tomatoes. They bring such a delicious flavor! It certainly doesn't hurt that it comes with their signature guac and a side of pico.I'll be here every weekend for the delicious dish and the $5 fresh squeezed mimosas! If you know whats good for you, you will too.~~#~1
I have been here a few times over the last 4 years and really liked it.  It was horrible on Saturday night (5/28).  I ordered the enchiladas with chicken.  When it arrived there were 3 tiny enchiladas with an ounce of cheese inside the soggy tortillas and the "with" chicken part apparently meant a few chunks of chicken would be tossed on top.  I was so disappointed, but starving so I ate it.  The guacamole was really disappointing too.  I don't think we will go back again.~~#~0
NO.  Don't go. Don't do it.  This was my first visit and it was on a whim because we drive by it often.  One other reviewer here made a wise statement - go the grocery store and buy frozen fish.  I promise it will be better than this.~~#~0
If you like sushi, go somewhere else. I was extremely disappointed in the quality of both the service and the food. I decided to take my family here because the other reviews seemed good; however, either my experience was an anomaly or the other Phoenix yelpers and I have stark differences in taste.The staff had great smiles, yet lacked follow through. We had to ask for water and extra ginger twice. The sushi rolls were the flimsiest I have ever seen! Although poor in quality, they were high in price for what they serve. I'm not sure about the names of some of their rolls...one was named "Climax." Gross and just distasteful.  The decor and ambiance leave you wanting. They have three different wallpapers hanging and the music is overwhelming. Even though this is the only sushi bar in Surprise, I will gladly drive to Peoria or Scottsdale the next time I have a craving for sushi.~~#~0
I've been to this location a few times, but this was by far the best experience I've had. It was two Sundays ago, myself and seven friends wanted to watch the early games and get some food and drinks. My friend called ahead and made a reservation. When we got there, we had a big table reserved right in front of all the TVs. Our waitress was very attentive, friendly and quick. They had a bunch of beer bucket deals that we all took advantage of and had a great time watching all the games, enjoying some beverages and eating some food. Their breakfast burrito with chorizo was fantastic and it'll keep me coming back. See ya next Sunday, Majerle's!~~#~1
Aside from the Macy's on 34th street in NY, this one is my favorite store.  They carry all my favorite designers, especially for work clothes.  Not to mention, the shoe department always the hottest selection of pumps.  There's a tiny Ukrainian woman that works in the shoe department, I love her, she is SO patient with me and gives me her two cents as she keeps bringing out the shoes.  I wanna meet the buyer for this store and become her/his bestie.  They also have a personal shopper near the women's dressing rooms.  Not that I'd ever have the need for one but you might.  The sales people are always really nice and helpful.On a side note: I once met this old guy who said he brought Janis Joplin to this store to buy panties when she did a show here.  I've always doubted that story but it never fails that when I go to the lingerie department I tell myself "I'm standing where the late great Janis stood."  She's one of my all times.~~#~1
Toasted subs at their best..   The worst part of eating here is trying to choose one sandwich out of my four or five favorite picks.  And in the fall when they bring out the soups, I can hardly resist ordering the cream corn soup with my meal.~~#~1
First timers to this park on an early Sunday morning. Me, my bf, and our 2 old English bulldogs had a great experience. You can choose between the active or passive dog park. We choose active but also decided to keep our dogs on leash being our first time and all. We were immediately greeted by a woman and her 2 boxers, very friendly. We walked the perimeter of the park to get our dogs use to being around other dogs and talked to several people along the way. We did have a small incident when a dog snapped at our dog but no harm, no foul. Looking forward to bringing the dogs here again!~~#~1
My husband and I went to Ernie's a few weeks ago on a Saturday night because it is within walking distance to our house and there is always a crowd so we wanted to check it out. We met our friends in the bar and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited. Still no-one offered to take our drink order. The bartenders and barbacks made eye contact but no-one came near us. We don't look like hooligans or ruffians or anything so it was irritating. The weird thing was there were people eating in the booths around us, and one or two other people at the bar (who had drinks.) We finally got up and left. Why waste money on places that won't take it! I won't return and will recommend my friends don't either!~~#~0
I'd have to say that among the restuarants in the Tom Jetland suite (Fez, Ticoz, Switch), Ticoz is my favorite because of its dimly-lit lounge-like quality, which provides it a cozier feel than the other two.  Add to that, the hypnotic Mojito creations and Ticoz is one of those places I could spend an entire weekend late afternoon at, as long as someone else drives, of course.The tamales are fantastic and are more similar to corn pudding than to traditional hand rolled tamales.  If you get them with veggies, you'll find that the veggies are a little oddly cut for the dish, so I recommend some other topping.  The beef is fantastic (especially in the tacos).All in all, this is one of my current favorites.~~#~1
I love-love-love Green.  The atmosphere is wonderful and the food even better.   The people who work here are lovely sweet and very helpful.   There are far too few vegetarian restaurants in Phoenix metro area and this one gets my full support.~~#~1
I have been here at least 10 times and have never had a complaint.  The staff is friendly, the food is great, the atmosphere is lovely.  My favorites - the LB lavosh and spicy cottage cheese.I will continue to come back to Local Breeze again and again!~~#~1
Heard about this interesting steak house from Lindsay, my Yelping 'go to' and I am grateful. What a fun night, feeling "Mad Men' ish as we walked through the kitchen when entering the restuarant. Atmosphere was amazing and the food.... WOW. My fav had to be the amazing steak and bean chili/soup.... fantastic.Steaks were our of this world and the mushrooms... devine.When entering the restaurant we greeted by helpful eager staff ... with each one adding input into our experience.... especially Patti, our server. She was helpful, informative, fun and sealed the deal of a fantastic night. Thanks~~#~1
Fable III used AND looks brand new for $11?!  OH YEAH!  I'll take it!I stumbled upon this place because our little cousin wanted to get a game, and he had been here before with his aunt.  The place was filled with classic games all over the walls and even to play.  I'm guessing classic original games are back and in style again.  Plus they are just fun to try or have a flashback from the 80s.  The store is clean, open aisles to walk through, great prices on the games and the customer service from Gary and Rich is phenomenal.  These guys were very nice, educated about the games, and went out of there way to make everyone happy.  Great job guys!  :)All the high star reviews are true!  This place is SO much better than any other gaming place I've been too.  My husband loved it too.  He was a kid in a candy store.  What a great find!  I think you should take a trip to this store, even if you don't play.  Get a game as a gift.  Just to experience this place, it is something special and unique.~~#~1
I love this place I have been here 2wice and it puts of the others in the country to shame. I hope that I can volunteer here.~~#~1
Loved it. Food was great, service was great. Not easy to find, but worth the search!!!~~#~1
I'm giving Bobby Q an extra star in this update to my previous review, because although it has its share of hits and misses, it is, in fact, as good as it gets in Phoenix for great barbecue. I love barbecue. It is a hobby of mine. When I get stuck on something and want to know what it should look and taste like, I go to Bobby Q and am almost never disappointed. Most recently, this happened with beef brisket. I'm going to upload a picture I took of Bobby Q's brisket because seriously, if you look at it and don't want to immediately die from desire, then you just don't like barbecue. If I had anything bad at all to say about Bobby Q, it would be that sometimes their meats can be slightly overdone but this is not the norm. Their quality control, considering how much food they must serve to keep up with the demand, is astounding.  Their prices are too high, but of course, you're paying for the almost Disney-esque atmosphere. Their sauce is absolutely delicious (although it should be noted: they don't understand what "spicy" means). All in all I really can't say enough good things about this place. Go look at my brisket photo. Seriously.~~#~1
Headed back to Lobby's. How I missed this tasty burger. I wasn't disappointed with round 2. The burger was still fantastic! I'm also happy that the fries were a little bit less salty than my previous trip. With any burger purchase, getting the combo pack (fries/soda) is the smart choice.I do wish that they would lose the styrofoam soda cups and offer more than one size of drinks.Make sure to grab plenty of napkins before you sit down. The burger can make a mess with the homemade sauce dripping off the meat and bun. That's a good thing in my opinion!~~#~1
Rivas helped me get through numerous late night study sessions and early morning hangovers!  Hard to go wrong with anything on the menu, but my two faves are the Carne Asada and Chile Rellano burritos...with fresh horchata, of course!~~#~1
Do Not Eat Here if you think a bathroom in any way has anything to do with the cleanliness of the food preperation.  There was literally dried smeared feces on the toilet seat and the floor looked like it had never been washed.  Of course the restroom cleaning check-list was not initialed the entire day. Oh...I almost forgot there were no paper towels to dry my hands.  I told one of the employess and he says "I know dude".  It's rediculous that the bathroom looks like this when you have 10 employess standing around with their thumbs up their asses gossiping. Burger was over-priced.  Milkshake was ok.  Also no napkins anywhere in sight on the tables or at the bar area.  Apparently napkins are something you have to ask for?  Whoever owns this place needs to get a better manager at this facility, because he is loosing money with all of the one-time customers who will choose to go somehwere else next time.~~#~0

Soft opening, so still working out the kinks. Food was deelish. Scallop poppers- crispy and spicy; not at all greasyHoney chicken-a little sticky but so goodTeriyaki chicken-subtler than other places' teriyaki, but much better flavor and chicken was tender"tootzi" roll- bursting with flavor and rolled perfectlyNice touches with cucumber water, upscale Asian decor, unique glasses, menus, plates, etc.Will definitely be back.~~#~1
By far the best Mexican food in Scottsdale! Food and Salsa amazing! Service phenomenal! Great prices!!!!~~#~1
As a bonafide recovering Art Bitch, I give this university gallery the blue ribbon award for kickassery!Truly a "hidden gem" (i hate that phrase) in Tucson, the collection and the revolving pieces never cease to impress me. I have brought almost every single tourist from the east coast to this gallery, including some photography professors, and they leave with snoooty mouths agape that in this pleasant little desert town resides a high-caliber, well manicured collection of the arts. I am always upset when I visit and I can't stop by this gallery-and don't miss out out on their catalogs, magazines, books, postcards and prints they have in the atrium as unique gifts/decoration.Splleeeendid.~~#~1
This is one excellent Ethiopian restaurant, rivals anything I've sampled in Washington DC or Seattle.  If I lived in Phoenix, this would be a Top-5 restaurant for me (along with Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles - yum!).Lalibela takes a slightly different approach to their menu.  Many of the entrees are offered as small portions ($4.50-$6.00 each).  They suggest each diner order 2-3 of these to make a meal. Kitfo and Lamb Tibs dishes are offered as full entrees and like many Ethiopian restaurants, you can order combo plates (meat combo, veggie combo, house combo plate etc.).  This made deciding on our meal a little more complicated, but also offered more flexibility for sampling different dishes.Our favorite dish ordered was the Lamb Tibs (the spicy version with Awaze spice paste).  Lamb was soooo tender, and the spices were a delight - rich in flavor but not too hot for those with tame palettes.  Good thing it comes as a full order - four of us were competing for bites!!  We ordered a half portion of Keye Wott (beef in a spicy brown sauce) that was some of the best I've ever had.  Again, rich in flavor but not too spicy.  My favorite Ethiopian meat dish is Kitfo - choice beef sort of like steak tartar (servered raw or lightly cooked) but with Ethiopian spices.  Lalibela's was pretty good, just not transcendent like the Lamb Tibs or Beef Keye Wott.  The vegetable dishes were on a whole excellent - especially the yellow lentils, gomen (collard greens) and spicy (Wott) lentils.Staff was great - attentive, helpful service.  Unlike some Ethiopian restaurants, this one is very user-friendly.  Although in some cases  the menu accommodates American tastes it doesn't compromise on quality or authenticity.  One note on the injera (sponge-like bread used to scoop up the entrees) - it's a mix of wheat flour and teff (a grain indigenous to Ethiopia) and I don't think it's fermented like injera that is made with 100% teff.  I'm used to the latter, but you can argue Lalibela's injera doesn't compete with the flavor of the entrees as much.All in all, one of the best Ethiopian restaurants I've been to, and I have been to many in the States.  Only problem now is whether my favorite Ethiopian restaurants in Seattle will still taste as good!  Highly, highly recommended.~~#~1
When I moved away, these were the tacos that I missed! I stopped back today, and must say - it was exactly how I remembered!  The lunch specials are very reasonably priced at $5.99 and come with two items and rice and beans. I always get the hard taco - seasoned shredded beef, lettuce, and cheese in a deep fried corn tortilla - and the cheese enchilada. I could eat the rice and beans alone, both are so well seasoned and they definitely don't skimp on the cheese! The only thing to watch is that the red hot sauce can vary from visit to visit - some days it's super hot, others - not so much.The wait staff is exceptionally friendly and always try to help me because my Spanish is so limited. The interior is large but very modest, there aren't a lot of fancy decorations - this is a place to come for the food and service and  not th ambiance. Still, one of my faves!~~#~1
Great place for Sushi, ordered the Musscles ( Caution very large order even with only four) Great wine. Ordered Eel Crunch Roll, Tuna Roll, Soft Shell Crab Roll. All of it was to die for. A little Gem.  Pricing is competitive not high or low. Environment is pleasant, service was wonderful and waitress was very helpful with suggestions and information.~~#~1
Been here twice now and tried two different dogs and two sides. Nothing was disappointing. I have tried both the sweet and spicy dog and the hana dog. Both dogs were great and had very distinct high points. The sweet and spicy does something very rare for me and actually gets me to enjoy pineapple mixed with other foods. I this dog had great flavors all over including the dog itself which was perfectly cooked and the right amount of heat. The hana was just a stack of messy amazingness that had a real mexican flair. The bacon is the real standout adding the great bacon flavor and a crunch that gives the textures some depth.The sides were good to. The chili is not some canned stuff and is good. The tater tots are just awesome though and nice crispy outside and that soft pillowy inside you crave.If you want a gourmet hot dog this place is not going to let you down.~~#~1
AWFUL.  Not sure it classifies as food.  Burrito consists of a flour tortilla and meat.  No salsa, beans, cheese, sour cream, guacamole.  Nada.  Plus they won't let you add anything to it.  Everything is as is.  The cheese enchalada had cheese but it was not gooey and melted.  The food was barely luke warm.   Service is also mediocre.  The salsa was gross.  It was super water down.  The best part of the meal was my Pepsi.~~#~0
Best Cakes around!This may sound crazy, but I've never actually been in this place.  But I've tried so many different things they have.  My job goes through Karsh's for all the anniversary cakes, catering, and special events.  We get cookies, cakes, and other assorted pieces of heaven from Karsh's.  Recently, my coworkers wanted to try something different.  They got an eclaire, cake balls, and mini rainbow cakes.  The rainbow cakes are the best thing to ever go in my mouth.  I could eat those for days.  They just melt in your mouth plus they're covered with chocolate.  What?  Yes!My friends also got me a Karsh's cake for my birthday a few years ago.  I wish I had a picture of it.  It was so pretty with a butterfly on it.  And it tasted amazing.Though I've never been a paying customer and I've never walked through their door, I love this place and highly recommend it for any event you may be throwing.~~#~1
This place does not disappoint.  I've been here quite a few times with coworkers and it's always a good choice.Cute place - I especially like sitting on their cozy, covered patio.  I hate mushrooms but somehow LOVE their fungi pizza.  I think it's the truffle oil that makes it amazing.  I've had a few of their other pizzas too, which are quite good as well. All of their salads are delish - you can't go wrong with any of them.If there's just one other person with you, you can't go wrong sharing a pizza and a salad.This place is WAY better than Pizzeria Bianco.Will continue to come back here!~~#~1
I'm not generally a big fan of burgers, but I love this place!  Their "blu burger" is amazing!  Bleu cheese crumbles, carmelized onions and thick, crispy bacon on an awesome onion bun, oh my!  I highly recommend adding avocado to it as well.  I can't speak for the other sandwiches because I love the blu burger too much to order anything new. Heh.The zucchini fries are a thing of beauty AND they allow well-behaved dogs to hang out with you on the patio while you enjoy your meal.  They even brought my little guy a disposable water bowl!I've also had great luck with their waitstaff, everyone is friendly and on task.  It's pretty busy on a Friday or Saturday night, but just perfect for a Saturday afternoon lunch.~~#~1
THIS PLACE SUCKS!!!!!  It really deserves NO STARS!!!You can only like this place if you don't know anything about Vietnamese food. What I tried...Bun Bo Hue:  Broth didn't even taste like Bun Bo Hue.  Spicy but has no flavor.  Where's the beef shank or hog's feet?  You can't have Bun Bo Hue without the shank or hog's feet.  They use the cheapest cuts of meat.  This item was on their Daily Special.  Pho Chin Nam:  The broth was super sweet.  You know what that means....MSG galore!!!!  Not even a hint of Anise star in the broth.  How can you specialize in Pho if you can't even make the broth taste right?Service stinks.  I hate it when the waiter holds the bowl in such a way that his thumb is on the inside of the bowl while serving it.  The dude never refill the water, ask how things were, etc.Vegetable platter was not fresh.  Bean sprouts were starting to brown. If you can't cook something why even bother serving it to customers.  I don't know about other entrees they offer but I won't be coming back to find out.  This has to be one of the worse Vietnamese restaurant in the valley. Check out my extensive list of Vietnamese Restaurants for suggestions to better ones.~~#~0
My favorite sushi restaurant ever! I love their ama ebi nigiri (sweet shrimp) and always craving for more. For this visit I tried their dynamite scallop roll and salmon roll (with asparagus inside) and it was so delicious makes me craving for more. The pork ribs were very delicate and it was melting in your mouth! What makes this restaurant to be my number one spot of Japanese restaurant in the valley was the sushi chef service is superb! They ran out ama ebi and I told the waitress that one of the reason I came there is for that ama ebi. The chef suddenly came back to me one hour later and said he saved one ama ebi for me!!! What a service!!!! I'm so thankful of this wonderful dining experience and will definitely become one of their regular customer!! Love this place so much!!~~#~1
Horrible service.~~#~0
I love Saddle Ranch for its casual night time festivities (including watching people ride the mechanical bull hehehe), but I cannot ignore the fact that the food was disgusting!When I think of my meal this past Friday night, I think of two words: dry and cold. The spinach artichoke dip was just okay - a bit on the dry side and not very cheesy. The onion rings were just okay was well as the batter reminded me of the chicken nuggets at McDonald's, maybe even worse. The BBQ burger (turkey patty) was dry and tasteless as was the bacon. Really? It must take true talent to cook bacon tasteless. There are a few things that the menu has going for itself - a few very unique and fun desserts and drinks that I have yet to see elsewhere. I am fond of the giant pile of cotton candy and, though I'm not much of a beer drinker, the beer tower looks pretty badass.For me, I came and will continue to come for the fun atmosphere, but I will definitely be staying away from the grub. Adios, cowboy.~~#~0
Love it, love it, love it! I have been eating at various Pita Jungles around the Valley since I moved to AZ over 6 years ago and I have yet to have anything that I didn't love. My favorites include the Black Bean Burger, Lentil Fetoosh Salad, all three hummus types, dolmas, and gazpacho, but everything is delicious, so you really can't go wrong! The Tempe location also has breakfast, which is amazing! Each location is fairly small, so luch and dinner may require a short wait, but its worth it. The prices are fair and the portions are huge! Don't be afraid to split a dish with a loved one.~~#~1
I know Kerrie through my networking and we benefit from her presence.I have not needed her service's and most of us don't plan on needing an attorney. But I am always reminded by a tagline that Kerrie often mentions. "People in crisis need company, Droban & Company". How very true. When that time comes, and in these troubled days, it WILL. You will need good company. I would look for Kerrie to help and so should you.~~#~1
We had brunch at El Chorro today and it was wonderful. The patio was comfortable with the umbrellas and heaters. The service was outstanding. The food was delicious. I had the creme brulee french toast - it was carb/sugar heaven. Everyone else enjoyed their food. The eggs benedict came out perfect. The BLT looked awesome. The fries were delicious. We will definitely be back.~~#~1
I have a fond place in my heart for this establishmentI've been covering my all white meat rice bowls in their sticky spicy teriyaki sauce for 10+ yearsI've lived all over the worldI always crave three things when I'm not living in Phoenix (or the USA)1.  Skim Milk2.  Mexican food3.  Tokyo ExpressNow pay attentionIf you like spicy food and teriyaki sauce, here's what you should orderAn all white spicy chicken teriyaki bowl5 extra sides of spicy sauceA small salad2 extra sides of salad dressingOk, so I REALLY like sauce.  Really.This place makes me want to cry I love it so much.~~#~1
Cork is an enigma.What makes it enigmatic is how damn good it is... Too good for Chandler and maybe too good for the valley.The portions are just right, and anybody that tells you otherwise is a fat ass or a glutton (I'm 6'3, 200lbs. and I was satisfied).  If you want large portions though, go to their lunch/brunches.  I've been there twice and had The Lamb Chop, which was amazing on all levels, and I've had some serious lamb in rural Bosnia, which has been labeled the best in their country... sure enough cork's stood up blow for blow.  The other entrée I experienced was the buttermilk fried chicken.  I was so amazed by the lamb the first time, that I had to try something more "simple" in order to qualify their food in regards to regular places.  Let's just say the chicken was not regular, it was outstanding.  The appetizers are crazy good... can anyone say king crab legs?The wine selection is top notch.  the booze selection is killin, and they even make this amazing Italian lemon stuff that's like 90% alcohol.  make sure you have a designated driver, because this place will inspire winos and boozers to indulge to their fullest.Go to Cork, because it's that damn good!~~#~1
Went to Yogurt Kingdom for the first time tonight.  It was perfect.  Lots of flavors to choose from.  My favorite is the Tart Vanilla.  But I got a large cup and tasted at least 8 different flavors and I enjoyed each and everyone.  I wanted to go back and get some more of the Tart Vanilla but my husband gave me one of those looks when I suggested it.  You can either eat inside or outside.  The place is decorated so cute.   There was a very cute and well mannered girl to greet us and told us how it all worked just in case we had not been there before.   They offered to give us any samples that we might like to try.  There was a gentleman there who turned out to be the owner.  He was very kind, friendly person  and glad that we stopped in.   The bathroom was very clean and the entire place was tidy and well maintained.   We will be back very soon.  I would recommend this place to others that like yogurt.  You won't be disappointed.~~#~1
I find it hilarious that someone would reference this place as being terrible,  compare it to (overpriced and bland) Humble Pie, and in the same breath say it was the best chili relleno you ever tasted. I can't vouch for the chicken tacos but most street tacos are nowhere near packed with meat. By definition they are usually very tiny with onions,some guacamole, a little cabbage, and some small cuts of meat.  I can say the tilapia tacos are tops(large filet on each) on the list of my girlfriend's quest for good fish tacos. I can say the pork nachos are the best I have had as the pork reminds me of Los Dos Molinos in a small way. The empanadas are excellent as well.If you go for happy hour you can get two empanadas for 6 bucks. You can also get 2 large fish tacos for 6 bucks. Would you like some awesome tortilla soup? 4 bucks.If you get the dinner version of the emapanadas with a large portion of some of the best rice and a side of black beans I think it sets you back about 11 bucks. I have also had the chili relleno and it is the best I have tasted as well leaving me to wonder with the single review you have for anything, why the venom?I learned long ago to ask for what is recommended for before you order and if someone recommends a place try what they are harping about first. When I asked they said the chili relleno, pork, empanadas, and red sangrias. Guess how my dining experience went? Try ordering tacos from Los Dos Molinos and you will leave pissed. Order the green chili pork and you will drive 100 miles for it.I do hope you give it another chance I have honestly never had anything sub par here in my 7 or so visits and they seriously could charge way more for quality than they do.  I agree that Main Ingredient is great also, that's why I took the time to write about it. But to reiterate:11-13 dollar for most dinner items besides new york strip(on the list to try), is not priceyhappy hour has most items for 4-6$street tacos are not bursting with meatask what is the best thing on the menu when you order some place then you can write it off all you want.Humble Pie  was more pricey and not worth it, All it does is take up parking from a much better place next door. For a place with the reference to pizza in it's name you would think it would be better, it tasted like peter piper.I would love to know what a good chicken taco is in your opinion, I cant think of any besides maybe the California tacos at the now closed Chuy's, but the ones my sister ordered from here were full of chicken and topped with a nice chipotle/ranch like sauce which is similar.~~#~1
LOVE Five Guys!~~#~1
This is a great Mexican food restaurant. I eat here for lunch once a week and have never had a bad meal. The "Asada y Enchilada" is my favorite dish. If you are an avocado lover like me,  this is the place to go. I always order extra avocado because they have the best and ripest avocados I have had anywhere.~~#~1
"Hipster,Trendy" ????-I think NOT !!!! Very disappointing......weird crowd ( older men on the prowl? ) , and unfriendly bartenders w/ lots of attitude. I've given this a few tries thinking I just hit it on a bad night , but won't be going back. So many other great places in Scottsdale to visit !~~#~0
"So Jimmy, tell the class what you saw at Sweeties!""OK, well, I saw lots of candy. Old-timey candy and cool candy and neat candy. Lots of it. Real lots.""And I saw people walking around with baskets and talking about candy. And talking about candy when they were little.  And talking about what candy they should get for their kids.""Oh, and I saw Turkish Taffy, Maple Bun Bars, Fruit Stripe Gum, Moon Pies, Cherry Mash, Mary Janes, Valomilk Candy Bars,Sen Sen Packs, Goo Goo Clusters, Squirrel Nut Zippers, Flipstick Lipstick, Licorice Pipes, Zero Bars, Twin Bings, Look Bars, Abba-Zabba Bars and U-No Bars.  And that was only a little of it.  And lots of other stuff.""Teach?""Yes Jimmy?""The coolest teacher ever would take her class to Sweeties.""Would they?""Yes."~~#~1
Standard Mexican fare - but quite delicious.  Pitcher of frozen margaritas was yummy, too.  Fast and friendly service.~~#~1
My profile says....My Last Meal On Earth: Chicken and WafflesLo Lo's is the reason why.  Everytime I visit Arizona, I make sure I hit this spot up.  I usually order the 'Lo Lo's' meal which comes with 3 pieces of fried chicken, with 3 waffles and a scoop of butter with syrup.  YUM!  This meal would not be complete without ordering their super delicious Sweet Tea which is served in a glass jar.  There are two locations, one in lower Phoenix, and the other in Scottsdale.  The one in lower Phoenix is the original location.  However, it's much smaller so wait times could vary.  The Scottsdale location is much bigger,  so dealing with long wait times should not be as big of a  problem.Winner Winner Chicken Dinner, Lunch and Breakfast please.~~#~1
Treats: We tried the cookies (chocolate chip and chocolate truffle) and would have to give them 5stars. Delicious!  Breakfast: Seems like they changed the recipe for the turkey maple sausage so it now has an odd herb flavor and less maple flavor, but tried the flattened meatball and liked it so might switch to that option. **If you go, be sure to check out the bathrooms. Each one was decorated uniquely by a staff member, and  the sinks are shared by both genders. You also get to see how very clean kitchen the kitchen is as you walk to the bathrooms, so that is a great bonus.  Overall, a great non-chain place for unique and delicious food.~~#~1
I first joined 24 hr fitness about a year ago, and I have had nothing but good experiences with the staff since the first day that I came in.  The people behind the front desk have always been very kind and attentive to my needs.  If I ever have a question or concern, it is always promptly answered or dealt with.  Some of them have even taken the time to learn my name and greet me as soon as I walk in the door! It is very impressive and makes for a very pleasant experience. :)On another note, I have been training with Trace for about 6 months now.  My goal was to lose a little bit of weight and tone up my body, and I could not be happier with the results! In 6 months I have lost 12 lbs. and I look and feel amazing! He is incredibly knowledgeable about training and nutrition, giving his clients hard workouts as well as meal plans.  Trace is the total package!**TIP: Try Trace's boot camp on Wednesday evenings at 7:30.  They will kick your butt!!~~#~1
Leah, the trainer, at Dog House Training Academy is great. She's friendly, knowledgable, and makes herself available via e-mail or phone should you have any questions. Her knowledge on dogs is extensive, and even though you're just paying for the class, she'll gladly offer up advice on any issues you may be having with your dog. The classes seemed simple enough to me, but there was a client in my class that just wasn't picking it up at all and blatantly disregarding her techniques. I was impressed with how Leah handled the situation and the customer. She's very thorough, and always explains why she does things the way she does, and why it works. So there are no questions, and it's always made perfect sense to me. With the quality of service, and the knowledge that you get to tap into while you're training with Leah, you just can't find a better deal out there. Her rates are competitive, and she offers referral discounts too.~~#~1
This place is super cute lunch joint.  I had the sloppy joe special and it reminded me of a home cooked meal back in the day.  I ended my meal with a classic vanilla milkshake which was superb.  Oh yeah!  if you're in a hurry for a quick good sit down lunch, this place is it.  our food came out SO fast.  I will be returning shortly.You also MUST check out the vintage clothing/ furniture in the room next door before you leave !~~#~1
The staff is great, the food is great, even the cappuccino is great (had my first one today).i work close by and I have a choice where to eat and it's very often Acacia for breakfast and lunch.A few of my favs are:- Chicken Salad Sandwich- Southwest Ranch Salad- OmeletsEnjoy! (maybe I'll run into you there)~~#~1
Wow!  Went on a Sunday around 11am - busy but not packed.  Roomy and comfortable.  GREAT food.  Bacon meaty and tasy.  I had the french toast on recommendation and it was fantastic.  Great atmosphere...just an all around great place.  We were in from LA for a baseball game and wanted a non-chain local place and found this place on Yelp.  Glad we went!~~#~1
When I lived in Phoenix, I was a regular at Fez. My friends and I probably averaged twice a week, and there were likely weeks when we were there more. The atmosphere is really wonderful, a rarity in Phoenix. The food is very consistent and almost everything on the menu is unique and flavorful. I must agree with some of the other reviews, that the waitstaff is very hit-or-miss. I've had wonderful service and terrible service, and there are times when I've had to go and ask the bartender to send someone over to our table to take our order... as regulars, in particular, I wouldn't think that this would be something we would have to deal with. That being said, there was one time when they were understaffed and the manager was very apologetic and even sent us a bunch of appetizers free of charge as an apology... so I haven't personally experienced the attitude that others report. I miss Fez... now I live in San Diego. When I go to visit, it's always on the itinerary, every time, usually as soon as I land.~~#~1
Why did I wait so long to try this neighborhood hot spot!  Having a father who grew up on Los Olivos I remained a loyal customer, that is, until last evening's change in plans lured me to the colorfully lit and lively patio of Los Sombreros Authentic Mexican Cafe & Cantina.  I am not an expert on "authentic" Mexican cuisine nor will I pretend to know what  the flavors of San Miguel de Allende taste like; however, I am a foodie so I know good food when I eat it.  We chose to sit outdoor and enjoy the beautiful weather while taking in another Cardinal's loss!  (Sad, I know, since they were off to a great start)....  Lucky for us it was a calm Monday night and we had the full attention of our waiter, aka the bartender.  Phil (no need to blush if you read this) did a wonderful job walking us through their many margarita selections while also conveying his personal favorites that showcased his love for whiskey!  My friend allowed Phil to make his margarita as he felt a fine margarita should be made while I allowed Phil to concoct my special margarita while following strict no sugar, no salt, heavy on the tequila preferences...and that was just to start!  Perfectly crafted margaritas in hand, check.  Now what to eat for dinner.  My friend ordered his beloved Mole poblano ($18.95) while I couldn't decide between the Smoked chicken enchiladas with salsa verde and chipotle crema (yumm) and the Pollo a la parilla with spinach in a chipotle cream sauce -or- tinga Poblana sauce($18.95).  I opted for the Pollo a la parilla with chipotle cream preparation and, once again, my dinner friend had 'order envy'!!  That's not to say his Mole was par (or dare I say sub-par) because it wasn't - it actually has received many culinary awards being named "Best Mole" both locally and nationally, but because the chipotle cream sauce combined with spinach, perfectly sautéed  chicken breasts and a side of warm corn tortilla is....AMAZZZZZZING!!!!  It's also fair that I note aside from the pricier entree dishes served w two sides (as we ordered), they also offer up tacos (3 at $10.95), various quesadillas (@ $5.95) and other lesser priced authentic eats including fresh guacamole, salads and more!  Deciding I'd save room to see if they could satisfy my sweet tooth I boxed my remaining dinner as we read through each and every dessert.  Undecided, again, and so we trusted our gastronomy guide, Phil, to choose.  He selected the Mexican Chocolate Cream Pie to finish off the evening, and we happily finished off this delectable treat leaving one bite as I always like to do!!!   Thank you, Phil and Los Sombreros, for the memorable dining experience.  The food was outstanding, margaritas made by Phil are the best, and the patio alone is enough to draw me back for HH or even a late night dessert.  Thank you for staying in the neighborhood, Azucena Tovar, and congrats on almost turning 20 years old.~~#~1
This is the place for a fabulos breakfast!! I have friends who visit from Texas and they wait all year to eat the Eggs Benedict here. They are the best. I  personally love the pancakes smothered in bannanas, pecans and hot syrup...yummmmy. They also serve some very healthy and delicious salds for lunch like the strawberry spinach salad and the sandwhiches ar e very good, Their is often a wait for breakfast but it moves fast and their is a community table which sometimes shortens the wait.~~#~1
Highly recommend. This is my second time here and I see #3 on the way.I've had the (bistec encebollado & arroz imperial with shrimp "no melted cheese") I do recommend both plates. Next time I will try (ropa vieja)Great service! Ask for Kelly.~~#~1
5 stars for the great $5 happy hour specials. the short rib tacos and the fish tacos are delicious and a bargain at 5 for 5 bucks. My favorite drink is the green tea lemonade--it was heavy on the liqour and so refreshing.Service was flawless. We were greeted hello and goodbye by two cheerful hostesses, our waiter and waitress offered great suggestions and the bar tender was sweet as well.~~#~1
We brought the entire family to Giuseppe's last night for a pre-Thanksgiving meal... yes, that's right - my family likes to carb up for all of the eating we do today!  We brought a ton of wine and had a great time.  Franco was our waiter - and I'm guessing since all the ladies at the table had a crush on him, that he is the waiter Sheila B wrote about in her review too.  Nice eye candy!I absolutely love the eggplant rollatini and pretty much order it every visit.  We usually start with a Giuseppe's Salad and finish with a dessert to share.  My favorite is the white chocolate tartufa.Pasquale (pictured above) is the sweetest man and makes the experience extra special every single time.  Since I'm writing this review on Thanksgiving, I want to give thanks to Pasquale and Ristorant Giuseppe for all the good times I've had there and all of the good times to come!  Salud!~~#~1
Went last night to Whore Foods to get basics to make pizza with, most clutch to the process was a three pack of yeast. Low and behold, the dirty hippie kids they have working there again didn't put something in the bag.And this time it was the yeast.I love the food there, but the employees are nothing more than entitled hippie kids from Scottsdale who can't be bothered to do their goddamn jobs! I am so sick of this crap with this corporation. Maybe its a Phoenix thing, or maybe its the hiring and firing processes of Whore Foods, but I am done shopping at any Whore Foods. In a place like Phoenix, where you have alternatives such as Sprouts, you'd think Whore Foods would smarten up.Or when you try to ask someone who works here where something is, and they just walk by with their nose high in the air. I understand its important to show your fellow dirt merchants that you're a super star, but I don't work with you, I contribute to your salary and over inflated set of benefits for a grocery clerk, so do your goddamn job. Useless little girl in need of a shower and orthodontist. But alas, Whore Foods and its dirty hippie employees have alienated yet another person with a job and a degree into hating everything that place stands for.Oh yea, one other thing, take the concealed firearm prohibition off of your stores. It didn't stop Jared Loughner from doing something horrid, and all it does is alienate law abiding citizens from their Constitutional rights. I understand you think that only parts of the Constitution should apply, but honestly I think you need to pull your collective heads out of your ass and take a shower.Useless motherf*&#$@s!~~#~0
The food is delicious.  The service:  discriminatory.  The bartender, blonde gentlemen, went around to everyone else, then finally acknowledge us.  This is embarrassing, I don't know what else to say.~~#~0
Great food and service! Country food at its best!~~#~1
Yes I do rock the hipster joints.  I dig this place.  A little bit of a scene, but the food is solid and the service is great. Hard not like it.  All in all a great spot.  I tend to switch up my favorites but I typically hit this up for breakfast when in the 602.~~#~1
Only 4 stars? (A few notes: The folks that rated this place low must have been isolated incidences and I feel weigh far to heavy on service rather than product. Dining at a restaurant, rate the service a lil' harder, but a coffee shop, hold your tongue.)Anyway, this place rocks. We aren't super close, but we pass up several coffee shops en route to Lola because the quality is top drawer.The beans, fair trade, and the roast is perfect. The price of a bag of beans is amazing. Doing right by the farmers and then respecting the product with such a solid roast. This is what is all about!I have yet to find a better americano. A splash of cream and a splenda only augments the flavor of the espresso and the richness really shines. I've been to most of the independent coffee shops throughout the area, and if I do find myself elsewhere, I can only compare them to Lola, and Lola wins out each time.~~#~1
I'm not normally one to jump at reviewing a chain restaurant, especially when there are 3 subways all within a couple blocks of each other.  I felt it was necessary in this case.  My husband and I came here over the weekend after a lovely trip to the dog park.  The two guys working here on the lonely afternoon were awesome.  They were really nice and friendly, and quite chatty.  One of them started helping my husband and the other one was sweeping while I was deciding.  The sweeping boy apparently noticed I was ready and he quickly ran to the back, washed his hands, threw on gloves and asked me what I wanted.  WOW!  This type of service has never happened at the other locations, all of which I have been too.  He chatted with me as I told him what I wanted.  He also joked about my weird sandwich and made me laugh.  It's refreshing to see a couple guys working on a boring day and actually enjoying themselves.  They also have outdoor seating which are perfect to sit at and people watch on beautiful days.  We even met this incredible 90 year old guy who is blind and deaf in both ears but somehow managed to communicate with us perfectly.  He was much more lively than most twenty-somethings you meet.  Amazing.  Only in downtown do you meet people like that.  This is a great Subway.  Go here and skip the others.~~#~1
Let's see...what is there NOT to like about Surprise Stadium? Well, $9.50 tall cans of PBR is about all I could come up with and that's not a surprise (pun intended) considering you're attending a sporting event...even spring training. But as someone who does not living in Arizona, and as someone who doesn't go to MLB baseball games in Southern California due to the fact it costs so damn much, people bitching about the slow service or any other little inconvenience when it comes to seeing a game here. Look, you're lucky enough to have almost an entire month of low cost MLB baseball right in your back yard. If I could, I'd live down here during March just to take in the awesome baseball action that crisscrosses the Phoenix metro area each year. I attended my first spring training game on March 12th, 2012 at Surprise Stadium as the Royals took on the San Francisco Giants (my favorite team). Our seats (Sec. 112, Row J, Seats 13-14-15) were 25 bucks each (around 30 bucks including service fees). I mean, we were maybe 5 or 6 rows back from the Giants dugout (check out some of my pictures). The stadium (funny calling it that since it only holds just over 10,000 people) is big enough so you feel you're at an MLB game but small enough to feel pretty close and intimate with the players. The stadium is well maintained and kept super clean. Arriving to the park, I was surprised (pun unintended) to see that parking was free, an oddity when going to an event like this. The stadium staff, as mentioned by other reviews, are mainly made up of senior citizens who were super friendly and helpful. I didn't have to wait long at the concession stands, even if lines were a bit long. The outfield is lined with a lawn area, perfect for people to sit back and have a picnic while taking in a game (Tickets are around 9 bucks each after service fees!!!). I love this place and hope to return next year when visiting family. Oh, Giants won 2-1! Go Giants!!!~~#~1
4-5 locations.. all 4.5 star average.. I think Arizona really has some fantastic Pizza options, and Spinatos is at the top of my pizza fix list.. the semi sweet sauce is addictive, great service, fresh ingredients, The Spicy Italian is my favorite... The chocolate chips cookies are laced with mind altering drugs, that make your body parts"romantic" when you think of their cookies.. BTW 5:30pm, on a Tuesday, when we left, a 30 minute wait.. Its on the List..~~#~1
I have been going to this place for years and love it, love it, love it!! The food is healthy, organic, natural and even gluten free.  They are always great to my grandkids and the kids love the food as much as the adults.~~#~1
Should have listened to the numerous negative reviews on-line (and there were many) but we trusted Guy from Diners, Drivins & Dives ...BIG MISTAKE. Clue #1 Strip mall with huge cheesy banner boasting "Food Network" endorsement. Clue #2  Self serves sign-in waiting list, apparently, the slimy owner was too busy gushing over customers trying to eat but steering clear of unhappy ones.  Misters and drinking water would have been a nice touch to make the 10-20min 104 degree wait more bearable. The minute we saw the paper table cloths and plastic chairs,cups & utensils we were in trouble. One waiter frantically tried to service the whole restaurant, which was a complete zoo. Now according to Triple D, the pasta was homemade....aaaaaah.....not so much.... Ive been to Italy, I know the difference.  Cut to the chase, $27.00 for two a la carte / appetizer sized entrees.Seems to me, his only goal is cashing in on the TV appearance as quickly as possible with no concern to repeat business...Don't waste your time and money....On a positive note, Guy was right about Matts Big Breakfast in downtown Phoenix, great good and the best costumer service we've ever had.~~#~0
Absolutely wonderful! Service was great. We had the mixed green salad & pork wings for appetizers. Both were great. For dinner, we got the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin (it was amazing!) & NY strip steak, which was good. The green chili Mac & cheese was the best dish all night--a must have!!~~#~1
Uhh...I guess I am the luckiest person to go to 25 Degrees!  I had the Charcuterie with the Chorizo Blanco,  the Soria,  and the coppa for meats and the Red Hawk(only place I've found in the valley who serves Cowgirl Creamery Cheese), the Benedictine and the Crescenza.  All were absolutley delightful and I was thoroughly impressed by the selection.  I also had the spicy tuna on eggplant...fantastic!  I ordered the number 1 which consists of sirloin patty, arugula, thousand island,  bacon, prelibato gorgonzola, and crescenza.  I ordered it Medium rare...get this, it came out MEDIUM RARE.  How lucky am I right?  It was excellent,  better than delux in my opinion.  Along with it I got the half and half of fries and sweet potatoe fries.  To finish,  I had a milkshake...simple and good.~~#~1
I came here last Saturday night with my family and I'm not sure what we were thinking but we didn't try to make a reservation until 2:00pm. That left us with 2 options- 5:15 and 9:15. Neither were appealing, but I really wanted to try this restaurant, so we went with the 5:15 sitting. It certainly felt strange eating that early, but I quickly got over that once I started to taste the food.The first problem I had with this restaurant was that everything looked so good. My family and I must have spent a good 10 minutes optimizing our order. We coordinated a strategic attack on the menu making sure that we got to try at least one thing form every part of the menu.We started with a Bruschetta and the Pesto Flatbread. The bruschetta was alright, a little small in terms of portions but our waiter did try to tell us. It was the Pesto Flatbread was what everyone at our table fought over. It was much larger than the bruschetta and had the creamiest, most delicious goat cheese on top. We then had a mixture of salads and entrees. I wasn't feeling all that hungry (remember- it was 5:15) so I just got a simple green salad. Let me tell you for $5 that was a pretty reasonable sized salad and their simple vinaigrette was very flavorful.My family members were all very happy with their dishes as well (sweet potato cannelloni, big eyed tuna, and the natural chicken), but the real winner of the evening was the Sangria.We ordered a pitcher of Red Sangria (tempranillo, cassis, blackberry, raspberry, strawberry) to start with and even considered ordering more. It had a lovely sweetness to it that came from the fruits and it was very addicting. I will definitely be ordering that again.I can definitely see myself coming here again and trying their other salads and their white sangria too.~~#~1
I was recommended to Dodge Electric by my sister. I'm happy to say that I was highly impressed by Dodge Electric and their expert services and fair prices. We hired DE to install our alarm system (they also provide monitoring), misc. electrical issues, and low voltage lighting for us. I can't ask for a better electric co.!By the way, I do think its odd that "Joe M's" review of Dodge Electric is the ONLY review he's ever made.~~#~1
I always get the Kung Pao Chicken. I've tried a few other entrees that my husband had (like a Thai dish that was pretty good) but my favorite is definitely the Kung Pao. Fresh, crispy snow peas and carrots and not drenched in sauce. And the crab ragoons are to die for!~~#~1
The food is great, I have tried so many different menu items I've lost track. I've also had some really great drinks, the bartenders know how to pour a nice alcoholic beverage! When corn is in season, unequivocally order the corn. Frasher's catered my Bachelorette Party, there was so much food, it was all fresh and tasty.  The owner is affable and very accommodating.  Stop by for a drink or dinner, you won't be disappointed.~~#~1
Confession: I am an obnoxious asian food snob. I really try to take that into consideration when I rate places. I haven't lived in China or anything, but I really, really love eating chinese food. I also hope to convey to you that I am still American at heart. I hate Panda Express, but I truly, truly worship an excellently prepared orange chicken. Be that as it may, there are instances in which I have to suspend my courtesy toward less-than-perfect food because the product that I received was not only poor quality, but insulting relative to the price I paid. This is the experienced I received ordering from Chopstick express.I ordered Chopstick Express' family special for me, my roommates and an incredibly hungry foodie friend of mine whom happened to be over. Upon reaching an orderer, it was refreshing, though annoying, to be talking to what seemed to be an obnoxious teenager being forced to take orders. Whatever, water off a duck's back. Quack quack. We ordered orange chicken, cashew chicken, and brocoli beef, which came with fried rice and egg rolls. It was supposed to come with crab puffs, but they were not delivered, which I felt was almost an insult.All the food we received was lukewarm at best, cold at worst. It's chinese food. It can hold at nuclear temperatures, and I don't think it snobbish of me to assume that delivery people can afford to invest in a proper traveling method. I must admit, my major problem with this is the fact that it took nearly an hour for the delivery person to get here. Which means assuming that the food left fresh, it spend a half-hour uninsulated. I don't believe I'll get sick from this food, but considering that being served very hot food is clearly the industry standard, it still seems sketch at best, and disgusting at worst.I digress. At any rate,  the food was as follows:Orange Chicken: The pieces of orange chicken were about the size of medium-sized chicken tenders. They were then covered in a weak breading, fried unevenly, and covered in a tolerable orange sauce which was the only saving grace of the dish. It came deeply compacted in a chinese take-out paper box, which was problematic for this dish because the chicken essentially came out in giant clumps. Brocoli beef: Easily the best dish, but only by reason of advantage. The brocoli was tender, though strangely bitter. The beef they chose to use was akin to stew beef, which is the really thick, fatty cut used in crock pots for stews because they have the capacity to cook for ever and ever amen. This resulted in incredibly large, chewy chunks. I gotta admit, Panda owns brocoli beef, and chopstick express could take a few pointers. The sauce was decent enough, yet ultimately forgettable.Cashew chicken: offensive. bland, strange. The sauce seemed to be more like cream of chicken than the savory, peppery sauce to which I am accustomed. I ate maybe two cashews in my share, which is boring. Interesting to note was the presence of noodles in the dish, despite the fact that we were also given rice. And peas. Peas? White rice: Nearly impossible to mess up, and only when exceptional is worthy of meditation. Average rice, though served essentially at room temperature, which dried the rice out.Fried rice: Shocking. In case you read my review, Chopstick Express, please take note: your fried rice sealed my distrust of your food safety practices. Fried rice is cooked fast and hot, but because of the quickness of the cooking, never dries out. This looked burnt. Literally burnt. Or seasoned with something both bland and dark as all holy hell. Fried rice should not appear to be dried out, burnt, and dark as chocolate. Egg rolls: I don't trust these. They were almost cold to the touch.Crab Puffs: not present in my order. THOSE ARE MY FAVORITE. D:Summary: Steer clear away from this place at all costs. The advantage of living so close to Mekong Plaza means not being terribly far away from decent chinese and vietnamese food, and I feel like I have disappointed my tongue by attempting to branch out. If these strange in congruencies aren't addressed by the management of Chopstick Express, I worry that, like what happened with me, they will lose crucial local business and be forced to close. I don't know, maybe it was an off-day. But in my opinion, if something takes an hour to get to my place when the drive is 10 minutes tops, it better sparkle and wow. Chopstick Express, in its disparaging food, disturbing distance from food safety and respectability, and excessive delivery time means that I will never eat from them again.~~#~0
I am one of those that fears the dentist and as a result haven't gone for years.  I went in and everyone was so easy going and helpful.  They were friendly and didn't make me feel like scum for not having gone to the dentist for such a long time.  WHEW!  Now that the initial visit is over I can relax knowing I'm in good hands!~~#~1
I was very disappointed in the customer service that I received from Jiffy Lube.  I went in with a coupon for a 29.99 oil change and walked out pay $80 for services that were not discussed beforehand.  When dealing with mechanic's I've always been skeptical and this place did not change my mind.  I am in need of an honest mechanic that isn't required by their employeer to upcharge the customer.  I will never return to this place again.~~#~0
LOVE this place!!!  Everything I've had is good..from the sunflower market salad w/grilled chicken, to the bbq chicken pizza, to the tortilla soup, to the squash enchiladas.  Their pasty chef makes a mean peanut butter cookie and my favorite are "usually" oatmeal raisin...I think I finally found a new cookie!~~#~1
Great service and loved the Acoustic music on the weekends~~#~1
this might be the worst KFC in the world.~~#~0
Over one year later, this review is behind, but wanted to get it out there... as I can still remember how terrible this place treated us. Hopefully, they've fired the manager and upped their customer service...We have been coming here for a couple years until last Spring training 2010. We had a party of 10 people. We loved going here because of the vibrant atmosphere and the sushi. So what transpired was this. We had a reservation, obviously it was busy, so even with a reservation we were seated an hour and half over our reservation time. It was fine, as we ordered drinks by the bar and waited. We then got our table, it took another half an hour  to order and another 45 minutes to get our food - so time frame was now almost 3 hours since we got to this restaurant. Half the people got their food and took another 15-20 minutes later for the rest of us to get our food. It was a lot of waiting...We ordered more sushi and it took another half an hour. Really - rolling sushi would take that long?! So we wanted to talk to the manager. They sent someone over and told him what happened. This is what he said " If you didn't like the service, go ahead leave, we have a ton of business and we'd rather turn the table for other patrons!" So I said, really,this is how you address the situation, without appologizing even and telling us to leave. We asked again to talk to the manager...he said I am the manager. What?! Everyone was so upset by this point and threw their money for their food on the table and left. This was the worst service I've ever gotten anywhere - ever! So to Ra Sushi - you've lost 10 customers for life...~~#~0
cons: no tea at a KOREAN restaurant, no water refill even though they should know it's like 200 degrees outside in PHOENIX and really, do they not realize how spicy the majority of their food is??, waitresses didn't know what the hell they were doing, didn't let me replace beef for pork, and yes, i'm just being petty as this point but their pen had no ink when we signed the receipt but we were just too fed up with everything else!pros: very clean place (because it's fairly new), especially the bathroom. i know there aren't many korean restaurants in phoenix, but don't eat here. they really have no clue how to run a restaurant.~~#~0
Have been there twice in the past few months.  First time was during the busier snow bird season.  My wife and I were seated quickly.  Order was taken and then they forgot about us.  Tables next to us got their food quickly but ours never came.  Spoke to the manager who offered to quickly make our entrees but we left since we had somewhere to go.  Tried it again about 3 weeks ago.   It was not busy but the service was again terrible.  We wanted to order drinks but could not get the attention of our server who was standing at the ending of the room talking to the other servers.  We finally had to ask one of the busboys.  Our food came relatively quickly.  My wife ordered a hamburger.  It was so greasy that the bun was saturated with grease and not edible.  We complained to the manager who offered to bring her another.  We decided to leave after finishing the appetizers. Would not go back.  It is unfortunate since we live  min away and would love to have a good neighborhood place.~~#~0
This is the best Thai restaurant in Phoenix. The food is authentic Thai and delicous. The prices are good and the portions are good sized. The yellow curry is fantastic, as is the whole chicken. My husband and I are consistent customers, we go to celebrate anniversaries and birthdays and have always had good service. l always enjoy the food and will always go back. Too bad not open on Sundays. I highly recommend this restaurant for excellent Thai food.~~#~1
This is my favorite Chinese restaraunt in the valley.  The service is fast and friendly and the prices are reasonable.  The staff here is so amazing, I can't stress it enough.  Very recently I called them with a sizeable order late one evening, only 20 minutes before they were set to close. They assured me that it was no problem at all.  When I ran up to their door they were there waiting for me, order in hand, and greeted me by name!I have tried several of the dishes and I have found them all to be delightful. I frequently order take out and it never takes more than 15 minutes to be ready and is always fresh and hot.  Eating in is equally enjoyable, the service is prompt, they serve complimentary tea, and at the end of the meal they serve a complimentary pastry filled with banana and dusted with powdered sugar. I've enjoyed the lunch specials on numerous occasions and they are awesome.  The egg rolls here are the best I've had in a long time!  Even at lunch the portions are very large, but are super cheap!  The lunch specials even extend to Saturdays!Recommended dishes: Garlic Chicken, Golden Gate Special Beef, Mushu Pork, Pork Fried Rice~~#~1
There are restaurants you go to for the food. There are restaurants you go to for the crowds. And there are restaurants you go to for the view......Different Pointe of View is the undisputed champ in the latter category. The food is good, about what you'd expect for the price (but that's not why you're here). You're here because those twinkling lights of Phoenix spread out before you both  will whisper sweet nothings to her like nothing YOU could ever think of. Nothing more romantic. So yo, Casanova,  if your love life needs that extra push off the (Tapatio) cliff, bring her here. And thank me later!~~#~1
We've been to Grimaldi's several times and every time it's just as fabulous as it was the last time.  Their pizza is, by far, my favorite in the valley and is always consistently good.  They have an excellent by the glass or bottle wine list and their beer selection is also good.  They have an excellent Caprese salad that we like to have as an appetizer before our pizza.  Their menu is small, mainly pizza and a few salads, so if you are looking for a place with lots of choices (pastas, sandwiches, etc) Grimaldi's may not be the place for you.  But if you are looking for amazing pizza, I would highly recommend giving Grimaldi's a try.One thing to keep in mind:  weekend evenings can be very busy, so I suggest going at slightly off times or bringing a dose of patience.~~#~1
I can't believe I'm only the second person to rate this place!  Anyway, no surprise I went there for the first time on a Groupon for the Pottery Wheel class.  They sold a ton (did I hear 2600?) this time.  Apparently the Saturday classes are massively booked, but you can still get in on the Wednesday nights.I wish someone would rate them for some of their other classes, or open studio, because all that stuff looks totally fun.  You really do get dirty, no matter how perfect you try to be, so as they warn you repeatedly, "wear your play clothes!"I'm 42 and took my mentee, a twelve year old girl (she's very grownup, but just being clear), and we both looovved it.  Neither of us had ever used a pottery wheel and could barely restrain ourselves when Mishy (our instructor, and the resident artist at Desert Dragon) kept saying, "wait for me to get to you!"  It's really amazing and addicting to get your hands on that clay, watching the wheel spin, and the cool shapes that come out.As beginners, we were warned to prepare to love whatever we made as quickly as possible and move on to the next one because 'over loving' your clay piece can lead to totally messing it up - making it too thin, lopsided and crazy.  And as beginners, we each made three pieces that were totally different and I'm not *completely* sure how that happened. :)  Apparently when you've been doing this forever (or maybe even for 6 classes or so), you learn to control it all more and purposefully create that look you want.The first thing we said to ourselves when we sat at the wheel was, "I want one!!" closely followed by, "when can we come back? and how?"  and the answer is that they have Open Studio time and you can pay by the clay and firings.  Mishy warned us that we can come in and play alone but if we do that right away we might be really frustrated because we really needed more time to learn the basics of centering with an instructor around - she suggested another class (or five lol).  Since there are a group of us that want to come in, she said that if there are at least four that book together they could set a class just for us and it would be $25 each instead of full price (plus we get our own class, which is totally cool).If that still seems pricey to you - they do have Dirty Hands Friday - just $12 and you get to play with clay (no wheel) and learn/do all the basic clay techniques.   I totally want to go!We were told to come back in 3 weeks to glaze our gorgeous creations.  We can't wait.BTW, since my husband asked this question, yes, this is waaaay more fun than going to those painting clay places (we're both mentors to young kids, so we've gone more than normal :) ).  It's way more fun, beccause you're creating the clay piece.  And btw, you still get to paint those clay pieces too!  (if you're into that)Oh, and one more thing, they warn you not to go to deep when you are hollowing out the middle - but why not? make a flower pot instead of a regular pot - stab that whole in the middle!  just sayin'~~#~1
This place is amazing!  From the mojito bar, to the different choices for cevice, to the duck, its all good!  Its a great adventure trying the latin fushion flavors unlike most have ever tried.  It is pricey, but surely not to miss.  Save this place for your anniversary, for sure!~~#~1
Had some killer sushi for lunch at Stingray today!The Crunchy Spicy Tuna Sushi is totally different than any where I have experienced it.  A well seasoned really combined tuna mixture sits atop a crispy rice rectangular tasty amazing thing!  You must order this...very special.The Spyder Roll was super fresh and a nice big portion.Shrimp Tempera Roll was delicious as well.The atmosphere was fun and the service was speedy and friendly.  There were so many choices that sounded fabulous on the menu and we look forward to going there and experiencing many more items!~~#~1
The food industry is tough and these guys didn't knock my socks off, infact, they didn't even snag or give them a gentle pull...food was bland and something was off...I'll give em about 4 months before they are out of business...go to bryan's bbq in cave creek if you want good bbq.~~#~0
Changing Hands rocks! Their staff is very knowledgeable, the prices are fair, they offer more than just books (lots of fun trinkets), they bring in some great authors (I've met Hillary Clinton and John McCain for example), and for writers, they offer some great writer's workshops. Oh, and the children's section is well stocked. If they don't have it or can't get it, it doesn't exist!~~#~1
I don't really like flying, but I can generally handle it. For some reason, though, on a recent flight from Orange County I had a full on panic attack on the airplane- I was convinced we were going to crash. I have no idea why...it was a short, smooth flight and nothing unusual happened. But for the 50 or so minutes we were in the air, I was terrified. When I landed (I made it!!) in PHX for a 3.5 hour layover, the first thing I did was look for a bar. There was no way I was going to make it through my much longer flight to New Orleans if the first flight was any kind of indicator.I found Jose Roux as I was walking to my next gate, and plopped down at the bar. It was relatively busy for 3pm on a Tuesday, and there was only one bartender behind the bar, but he greeted me quickly and with a smile, and when I ordered my drink he asked if I wanted to make it a double for just a couple bucks more. Well fine, since you twisted my arm, I might as well...Two hours later and 2 (so 4) drinks calmer, I left the bar to go find my next flight. I left feeling very pleased with my new found calmness, and with the experience at Jose Roux. The drinks were very reasonably priced, especially given the fact that it was in an airport, and no one seemed to mind that I didn't order any food. At some point my original bartender's shift ended and his replacement wasn't as great (a little slow), but that probably worked out in my favor anyway.~~#~1
I have to say that I love this place! We have been going here for years for so many different occasions and I think thats why I love it so much. It is great for special days, like anniversaries or birthdays and my favorite time, Sunday night at the bar. My favorite things to eat are: The mussels, the pizza, Mr. Fish of the moment, the chocolate cake, the meatballs, and those little apple bites he won on Iron Chef. We love Jim and Harry and Patrick too! The people working there have been there for years and its always nice to see the familiar faces.~~#~1
We have been dining at other locations of Grimaldi's for the past year or so. Due to our location, we decided to try their new location. It's located in a shopping area and that's the reason why we were near there. Upon entrance, we were shown to our table. Our drink order arrived fast, as did the refills. The salad was made to order, so it's always great. We ordered a small house salad for the two of us but it could serve three. The large house salad would serve 4 or an army. For our main course, we ordered a large 18 inch pepperoni calazone--they are the best here. In the past, we have ordered their pizza and it's a great coal fired oven pie. One note: If you're with a group and order many hot items, you can request staggered arrivial so everything stays hot. Otherwise it all arives within minutes and the pizza does cool off fast. The restrooms are very clean and we noted no issues at this new location. We shall return!~~#~1
Just tried this place for the first time thanks to a Local Dines coupon. Let me tell you, I had read some of the reviews on Yelp before purchasing the coupon, but I did not expect such an awesome experience. Our server was pleasent and knowledgeable, which these days is hard to find. Also, because the bar booths were full we sat in the empty section of the restaurant. i was afraid we would be forgotten about over there, but our server was well aware we were there.  We ordered cheese curds, which were great, for an app and a couple of cheap beers. 2$ on a tuesday night, who woulda thought! Next we ordered the "south of the border burger" w/ onion rings, and the "angry chicken" sandwich with tater tots.  YUM-O!!!  Nothing to complain about, the amount of food served was beyond plenty and the flavor did not leave you anything other than wanting another bite!!!  We will be making this place a regular on our "where should we go to eat" list!~~#~1
Best steak money can buy within the 20-Mile radius of its location.  Been there multiple times and the quality and the taste have been excellent each and every time.  Since ocean club is also in town, providing good quality and fresh sea food has always been one of their top qualities. I do recommend a sea food tower,  and a lobster mashed potatoes for every dine.It's well decorated and the lighting has been set for the atmosphere and the crowd.  If you sit at the bar area, holding a conversation can become challenging at times.Service has plenty of room for improvement;  Warmer staff will definitely help this manner; I do understand a few minutes of wait before getting seated, but every time has been at least 15-25minutes which  becomes very slightly annoying at times, but it will give you an excellent opportunity to have a drink or two at the bar and try one or couple of their Mojitos which are excellent while waiting;Staff members  are very knowledgable.Overall, when you desire a good steak for dinner, or a place to start off your night, this place could be an option.This place will get 5 stars for where it's located;~~#~1
Currently in love.  Sorry honey, there's a new someone in my life.~~#~1
I found Bosa after an amazing meal at Becketts Table. I know, what the hell am I doing going across the street after a huge meal. Well, with experiences at great donut places in Texas, I have always wondered where the great donut place is for AZ.Bosa Donuts is that place! They carry all the classic donuts and you won't be let down. These are not like the large chain donut places. Bosa donuts are always fresh, whether you are there at 6:00am or Midnight. Yes, I know. Bosa Donuts is THE Donut Place in PHX!~~#~1
This is the best venue in Phoenix for live music. I'm a musician and have played 5 of my 6 last shows there. It's one of the few venues where I actually want to stick around after we load in our stuff early in the evening. They treat local acts with a lot respect and really do a great job with sound.  The bean burrito is amazing with their green salsa.  I got to experience an amazing dance party here that happened out of thin air.  It changed my life forever.~~#~1
Always pleases and puts a smile on my face. The bread is always fresh and flavorable. The toppings are plentiful  and fresh. Perhaps the best sub sandwich for reasonable price. The chocolate chip cookies are homemade and a so delish.~~#~1
So far great stay.  Great staff clean room.~~#~1
Clean.  Fast, friendly service.  Great food.  All seven of us really enjoyed our lunch here.  We went a few weeks ago, so it's a little difficult to remember everything we ordered.  We ordered 6 dishes I believe and shared.  Massaman Curry, Drunken Noodles and the Pad Thai dishes were excellent.  Great flavor and the spices on the table allowed those of us to get things as hot as we wanted.We'll definitely be back when we're in the area again.~~#~1
It's Chipotle and for me that says about everything. It is the family default when dining out.  This is one of the best ones that I have gone to, but you can never go wrong at a Chipotle.~~#~1
Whenever it is my dads pick for dinner we always end up at Charleston's. No matter what he always orders the ribs. He says they are extremely tender and just fall right off the bone.  Before he even eats his ribs, he loves chomping on their delicious buttery croissants. If you don't care about calories, then you must not pass these croissants up. My mom and I usually go for the baked chicken which is always delicious, but they have a wide variety of food to choose from. Whenever we go there we can make reservations and even last minute. Also, the service is always great and they are on top of things.  I have a feeling we will going to Charleston's on Father's Day so he can chow down on his BBQ ribs!~~#~1
The husband / wife / dogs are knowlegeable and friendly... they will continue to offer tons of advice if you keep asking.Exotic varieties.. they also had the same brand (Dave Wilson) and some other unique variety of the fruit trees found at Bakers.  I kept staring at a 3 variety peach tree w/ low chill hours, but alas we already picked up our trees a few wks ago.Good luck to our baby avocado tree, and I better not catch you Yelpers picking the fruit off (in a few years)!  :D~~#~1
The Crescent Ballroom is one of my newest favorite haunts Downtown. It's open late every night, they have a great beer selection, fantastic bands and the food is made by the owner at Gallo Blanco. You can't beat the ambiance either! Exposed brick and wood covered walls makes it feel antique and vintage while still looking fresh and new. There's always a space cleared for dancing when the DJ is working and people are always willing to jump in and have some fun.They also carry a couple of cider beers, which is great for the gluten-free beer drinkers. One caution, stay away from their famous honeybadger - because he definitely don't give a sh*t!~~#~1
I've been meaning to go here for the better part of a year, and I'm sorry I didn't try it sooner!  Unbelievable!  So delicious!!!  My boyfriend and I stopped by about an hour before our movie at the AMC nearby.  He ordered Chicken Katsu which he was delighted with.  I ordered the Fried Shrimp, and I was most impressed!  The shrimp was so delicious, I could barely stop myself from eating the whole meal, even though I was stuffed!  The macaroni salad is the best I've ever tasted!  I ordered passionfruit juice in a can as well, and it really hit the spot with my dinner!  We also treated ourselves to a little cup of poi, which was authentically delicious, to the best of my knowledge.  The service was fast and friendly, and we will be back again and again for the outstanding food!~~#~1
These guys are the best. NEVER more than a few minutes wait to be seen and as others have said, both Dr. Salek is patient and kind and will take as much time as you need to answer questions for either parent or child. We've been going to the Mesa office for years and just recently had to call on a Sunday. The answering service was similarly kind and Dr. Ciminello called back in less than a minute, was thoughtful, generous and patient. Put my mind at ease and was great. Every thing you'd want for your child. Yay for the awesomeness that is Pueblo Peds!!~~#~1
Love this place. Anybody who throws up any of La's food just isn't accustomed to ethnic spice.~~#~1
Pei Wei is one of our favorites! That's partially due to the wonderful food but the management of this particular restaurant exceeds all others. The manager, Jimmy, knows how to keep his staff and patrons happy. We've been in on weekends and even on a Valentine's Day where the line was nearly out the door, but because this establishment runs such a tight ship, we have never had to wait longer than 10 minutes for a table on their busiest of nights. Highly recommend  their Honey Seared Chicken, Kung Pao and Mongolian Beef but it's the service that earns them this 5 star rating.~~#~1
This aiport is great. Secuirty is always a breeze dispite being in the top 10 busiest in the US.  Terminal 4 is great with multiple food options before and after secuirty. Terminal 2 and 3 are much smaller but still great and have food and lounges.  Terminal 2 has a military room and United Red Carpet Club.  Terminal 4 has 3 US Airways clubs there.  Best of all, FREE WI-FI.  They also have good shuttle service between terminals and the light rail to connect to PHX, Tempe and Mesa.~~#~1
OK, this is the thing. Don't expect anything but some comfort food for a reasonable price. Otherwise you'll be pretty disappointed.The decor is appealing, the food is decent for the price, the service is friendly, and all in all is a good experience. It's a best seller for kids, and there's nothing not to enjoy of this place if you know that you're going to an inexpensive place to put something in your stomach after some shopping or a movie.Remember, this is a chain that started in Portland with the vision of feeding the family for a reasonable price focused in the whole dinner (meaning that your entree comes with soup or salad and desert).The spumoni is delicious!So, if you're leaving the mall or the movies and you need a quick bite that won't hurt your finances and the food will taste good, and the decor and service are great, this is your joint!~~#~1
I finally made it to the new Biltmore location of lululemon the other night... I'm a huge lulu fan, and I must say, I was extremely impressed!This store must be four times the size of the previous Old Town showroom, and not only do they carry a ton of amazing lulu merchandise, but the staff was super friendly and helpful (thanks Roslyn and Kate B) despite the fact that we walked in five minutes before the store was closing... Also, since the location of the store is in the Biltmore Fashion Park, they offer free classes every Sunday at 10:30am that are open to the public.  How cool is that?  I will have to go sometime for sure!  Oh, and extra bonus - I think this store is going to be starting a running group soon too!When I go into lulu stores, I feel like a kid in a candy store... there are all kinds of colorful merchandise from sports bras and tops to shorts, pants, dresses, yoga mats, headbands, and oh so much more.  I love it all!  I treated myself to one new shirt during this trip... I even went a bit crazy with the color - it's green!  (I'm usually all about solid whites and blacks).If you're not yet familiar with Lululemon, this store is worth a visit... but I will warn you - it's easy to get hooked!  I'll sign off with a few of the motivational quotes that are on the business cards and bags for this store:"Do one thing a day that scares you.""Friends are more important than money.""Practice yoga so you can remain active in physical sports as you age.""A daily hit of athletic induced endorphins gives you the power to make better decisions, helps you be at peace with yourself and offsets stress.""Dance, sing, floss, and travel."I love lululemon!~~#~1
Melinda is a great dog trainer.  She uses only positive reinforcement and the dogs really respond well.  She is totally passionate about what she does and that commitment to excellence translates to great classes and great one-to-one work with a  trainer who  teaches you how to work with & train your own dog.~~#~1
This course was awesome to play. It is one of the toughest desert course I have ever played. The layout is great. The staff goes above and beyond to make you feel welcome. I would rate this course a top 10 in the east valley. The Wicked Six is just that.~~#~1
Ed and the team at The Drummond group were great to work with throughout the entire home-buying experience. They were there from beginning to end and we couldn't have asked for a more smooth process. They are extremely knowledgeable and made sure all our questions were answered and we felt confident with our purchase decision. Communication was constant so we never felt like we were left alone. I would absolutely recommend them whether you want to buy or sell. They are complete professionals from top to bottom and they made buying a home a positive experience. If I ever needed a realty group I would have no hesitation on where I would go!~~#~1
We went here last night as a result of a groupon and we'll definately be back. The deviled eggs were fantastic and the flat bread was excellent. Can't wait to return to try the entrees. Service was great and atmosphere is comfortable. Noise level was just right. And most importantly, the smoking section is out back. So the patio can actually be enjoyed without smelling smoke. Great idea. I wish more restaurants would implement this concept. I would eat on the patio more.~~#~1
Forget Macayos Mexican Food!  (I hope you already did) Forget what you knew about Tex Mex or other Mexican restaurants, or wannabes!  Take everything you love about Mexican food and make it gourmet with fabulous presentation, and place it just past downtown Scottsdale.  Los Sombreros is hip and fun with a great bar, wonderful tequila, and a nice outside seating area combined with some of best food I have tasted.  I have thoroughly enjoyed myself each time I have been here, and I will always go back.  Everything I have tried has been excellent.  The staff is friendly, and the restaurant is family owned.  This place is always busy, so there may be a bit of a wait, but I swear it will always be worth it!~~#~1
My review is for the Scottsdale location.  I really hate to give this place such a good review because if everyone knows about it, I won't be able to get a table.I can't say enough good things, make that GREAT things, about this place.  Service was excellent (as Always).  The Fish and Chips was beyond a doubt, the best I have EVER had.  I said that last time I was here, but I really mean it.  Can you believe, not only was it a good size portion, it was only $10.00.  We had the Almond Amaretto & Cinnamon Ice Cream Cake for desert.  If people were not around, I would have licked my plate.  fantastic!~~#~1
Great venue, great people... awesome stage and sound!~~#~1
Great $2.75 gin tonic happy hour.   If you like to get crunked this is  the place to go.   The bomb Golden chicken wings $5.   plus a great game room upstairs and huge big screen TVs to watch your fav team.~~#~1
Love it, love it, love it!!!! Just.... not the space. SO small and always packed results in either a long wait or us leaving to find a different place to eat. However, the food and service is always excellent. If you've never had a pasty before, you need to go and try one. They are very filling and every different kind I've tried, has been excellent. If you don't know what it is, think of it as like a larger, tastier & fresher hot pocket. I normally stick with "The Oggie", "Bangers & Mash" or "Cottage Pie". All 3 are excellent. I also request an extra side of their red wine gravy. Its amazing!Don't be scared off when you walk in to find dark walls, dim light and rock music playing. Nor the servers & chef's with tattoos and piercings... because you could easily miss out on one hell of a meal.(I'd like to add that if you want to avoid the small, dark space with limited seating, you can always try out their other location off Dobson & Guadalupe).~~#~1
I'm not gay. I love Amsterdam. See what I did there?The ambience and staff at Amsterdam are pretentious-less and anxiety-inhibiting. The drinks are well-mixed and appropriately priced. The bar itself is inspiring and the seating, comfortable.~~#~1
I love Chick-Fil-A... the spicy chicken sandwhiches, the lemonade, the soup, the brownies... So I am a bit biased due to it being one of my mom's favorite fast food joints and a special out of town treat growing up (we didn't have these in my home state of Washington!). There's just something about chicken, pickles, and mayo that works. :-)~~#~1
Yum! We had a mail coupon for buy one entree get one free, so figured what the hell and gave this place a try. It's located in a strip mall, but certainly doesn't feel like it when you are inside. It has quite authentic decorating, is clean, and VERY welcoming. It feels like being in a family restaurant with a cozy feel in Mexico. We were seated instantly. We had the best service here I have EVER had. Not exaggerating. Jovan was our server and was amazingly fast, efficient, friendly, and motivated. Our drinks were always full, food was out in a flash and just how we had ordered it. He was amazing. Always smiling- all of the customers appeared content and relaxed.Onto the food here- spectacular! It seemed quite authentic. It was hot, great flavoring, and the menu is large and diverse. They give chips with 3 types of salsa that were all very different, but wonderful. I saw quite a few people order the "fajitas for 2", which were huge and presented well. I really highly recommend coming here for lunch or dinner. Comforting feel and absolutely perfect service. I have still been raving about it.~~#~1
Shame on the owners of Haus Murphy's for participating in the sham of a TV show "Mystery Diners!" When the producers promise free publicity, and you so easily lie to the public - that is not a business I will support. The "manager" under scrutiny on the show was an ACTOR - not a relative, and not a manager. The show, the conversations, the issues......all phony. Entertainment is one thing, but. I do not respect this at all!~~#~0
UNION HILLS AND 7th AVE LOCATION!!I went to Roberto's 3 or 4 of times, the food is pretty good, nothing amazing though. The staff isn't too friendly. On my last visit, after I ordered and was waiting for my food, I noticed I never received a receipt and was over charged roughly $2.50 on my $10 order!!!!Thinking back, I realized I had never been given a receipt during any of my prior visits. I didn't even bother saying anything. I guess the tips I left in their tip jar just weren't enough.When I got home I went onto their website but no contact email was listed, I then tried calling their restaurant in Anthem a few times to possibly speak to a manager, no answer.No need to say, I won't be back.~~#~0
I used them for my move on Saturday, 3/17/12 from the Kierland area of North Scottsdale to Old Town. They were perfect!I'm very demanding and did a lot of research before I picked my movers.The price was competitive (3 hr for $195 out-the-door), and included all packing materials, truck, etc.It was supposed to be 2 movers, and I got 2 plus a supervisor. So it was really 3 guys.They showed up on time and worked efficiently.They were very careful with my furniture and didn't damage a thing. The only item I was worried about is a big black leather couch, and they handled it carefully with no damage or scratches!I always look to Yelp and do my due diligence when selecting service providers, such as movers, and these guys were great! I highly recommend them and would use them again.They also accept credit cards. I paid with a Visa.~~#~1
Being from Chicago, we are used to getting authentic Chinese food all the time.  But when we first starting spending a lot of time in Scottsdale/Phoenix, we found it a challenge to get authentic Chinese food.  We were excited to find the Golden Buddha and have made many trips over the years all the way from the Troon North area to get our fix.  However, service has declined to the point where it is no longer worth the aggravation.  We went there last night for Chinese New Year and will never go back.  Granted they were very busy because of a lot of large tables there, but waiting almost an hour to get our food is not acceptable under any circumstance!  45 mins. into our wait, the waitress came back (after we flagged her down to ask about our food) and said one of the dishes we ordered was not available....after 45 mins.!!!! What makes the whole experience an unforgivable one is that the manager/owner is so indifferent and never apologized or offered a discount off the bill...nothing.  When we left, the same manager was at the piano singing in Chinese. Huh?  Other than Nee House in Scottsdale, the search goes on for a restaurant that serves authentic Chinese food closer to home.~~#~0
Hey Shannon, Lush actually originated on the south coast of England. But you're right on the most important thing -- Lush is amazing!I only wish there were a store closer to me. On the other hand, if there were I'd need a second job just to keep up with my bath products obsession :)It seems there are a lot of natural, handmade beauty products these days. But Lush still is unique. I love the solid shampoo bars (Seanick is top) and the Fresh Farmacy cleansing bar with tea tree, chamomile, and rose is my daughter's favorite.~~#~1
Poor service and very poor food. Chicken in the fajitas tasted expired. Would never eat here again.~~#~0
I have become a soda snob, and it's Pop the Soda Shops fault.  Sure I could drink regular Dr. Pepper and Mr. Pibb, but why would I want to knowing that Dublin Dr. Pepper and Dr. Dublin exist?Pop carries all sorts of boutique sodas, many with pure cane sugar as the major sweetener.  I used to love Coke, Pepsi, and even Royal Crown, but now I just taste bland high fructose corn water.  Thanks Pop the Soda Shop, for ruining everything.~~#~1
We went here with a group for my girlfriend's birthday and had nothing but great things to say about the place when we left.Upon arrival everyone on staff new it was her Birthday and promptly wished her a happy birthday before we even sat down. The menus, created just for our party also had her name on them with a celebratory theme. Sure its a small detail but the amount of effort they put in to make her feel special was truly top notch.On top of the amazing customer service the food was top notch and  well prepared. I recommend the Filet if your willing to spend the extra coin for it. Easily one of the best I've had in town.Overall, in case you can't already tell, this place earns its five star rating from me and I wouldn't hesitate to send anyone back here!~~#~1
This was my first "trip" to Cuba and I really enjoyed the food. I will most likely never go to Cuba, but if I do, I know I will really enjoy the food. I had the Cuban sandwich and it was so good. The meal was hot and I have no complaints. Ty was a great host!  It was sad to see this place empty on a Friday night, hopefully they will stay in business.~~#~1
Pricey little sandwich joint and cheap atmosphere.  That's the best way to describe this place.  Indeed, my belly was full -- full of bread.  Where's the beef!?  --- oh the 80's!  My sandwich was mostly bread, lettuce and tomatoes.  The clam chowder was probably the delight of my meal (sandwich & soup combo) Couldn't complain much about the service since it was quick.  The place was super cheap on the decor -- though I did appreciate the helicopter ceiling fan.  Think I enjoyed that more than my sandwich -- Enjoy!~~#~0
Okay yes this is my second auto shop review and yes I'm a girlie girl, but a good body shop and great mechanic are priceless tokens!! And when I had a BMW the guys at Auto Europa were my best friends :) (to put it in perspective, I was in a first name basis with the owner!!).  If you've owned a beamer you know how insane the maintenance and repairs can be (you've been warned if not!), and having a trustworthy, affordable shop is like finding the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.  So here you are grasshoppers, my secret to Euro-car repair bliss :)~~#~1
SanTan has everything you could ask for in a brew pub. Great beer paired with a creative menu, friendly service, live music, outdoor seating. Great spot to bring friends or make new ones.~~#~1
I went this restaurant after reading from Yelp even tho it is kind of far from me. The food was good, but what I like more about this place was the atmosphere. It made me feel like I am in Vietnam. I liked that. Honestly I am not sure about the taste. I didn't feel really special but I liked it because I like Vietnamese food anyway!~~#~1
Changing Hands Bookstore is easily one of, if not my favorite bookstore anywhere in North America. The atmosphere once you walk in is welcoming. The staff is cool and friendly and they don't hover while you search through their many aisles. You can find books on any topic ranging from organic gardening to paganism to the best sellers. The prices on the new books aren't great, but their selection of used books makes up for it. All the books are in excellent condition and they have a huge selection of art related books near the back (at least it was in the back of the store last time I visited). They have a lot of in-store events, from discussions, book groups and author signings. It's a great place to hang out, read a book, smell incense, chat with other book lovers and just chill.~~#~1
I waited for the store to open at 8 AM the day after Christmas..... but they had the same discount they had before Christmas, so shop other stores....A crowd of people were milling around the front of the store, speaking to the manager, asking why they did not make down the Christmas merchandise, as they were told it was going to be marked down by store employees before Christmas. Quite a few people were told the same thing.... yet the manager did not handle this very well, and quite a few people walked out....... shame on you Garden Ridge !~~#~0
I watched in awe as he carried my food all the way to my table and attempted to get the high chair for me on the way there. When I said "thank you", he said, "My pleasure."I knew Chick-fil-a was "kid friendly" but I had no idea how easy they would make it for me to eat there on a mother-son date with my one year old. My hands were full with the boy and my purse so I was very glad for the help from my server.Our chicken was fresh and hot and the fruit cup was perfect for my son to feed himself.~~#~1
Since I am Navajo and Born and Raised on the Navajo Reservation I miss home at times, and this place provides the comfort of Rez LIfe. Ive been a fan and an admirer of this business.  since I first found them at First Fridays.  They used to be in Mesa and Now are in Central Phoenix.  Their food of course is what keeps me coming back!  I miss home sometimes and whenever I experience this resturaunt it Always provides me the comfort food and hospitality of home on the Rez!!  I definetly recommend this place for everyone.  Not only does it provide authentic Native American food but also the ambience of the Reservation at its purest..even down to the cheap soda in the side fridge....I LOVE IT! its great!!~~#~1
Ok the place is gross like really really disgusting but the food including the cookie ( that comes with the meal) is AMAZING!!! It's a crazy mix, a crazy delicious mix don't miss out because it's in a creepy spot just make sure u park your car close to the window and lock your doors : ) it's not really that bad!~~#~1
Came here for the Masquerade party in September.  A beautiful night.In general the DBG is a wonderful place we always enjoy coming to, especially when the Monarch Butterflies are here.The Luminaries are always good too~~#~1

I was referred to Dr. Laurinda Kwan a Naturopathic doctor by a friend at work, who I had shared how I had difficulty losing weight and I felt lousy and tired the majority of the time.   Dr Kwan took her time to talk with me and learn about my health.After running blood work and finding out my overall health numbers, she put me on a regimen to focus on getting these numbers in range.  Dr. Kwan also had diagnosis a low thyroid function and put me on medication.  She then ask me to try a different eating regimen.  She talked with me about trying a Vegan diet, but I responded back with, " No, I can do a low fat, but no way could I eat a Vegan diet."   I left her office after saying this and I heard these words play back in my head to the point that I said what could it hurt.  Without telling doctor Kwan I gave the diet a chance, about 2 weeks into the diet, I notice a change in how good I felt and I could tell that I was already dropping weight.  I decided that I would eat a Vegan style diet and I would also juice fruits and vegetables because I knew I could get more in my diet if I did both.   It wasn't long before people in my office started noticing the weight loss and commenting on how good my skin was looking.   It's now 30 days later and I've dropped 2 sizes in my clothes, but I never stepped on a scale to weight myself.  I noticed that more than anything health ailments such as arthritis in my joints stopped hurting.  I wasn't haven't heart palpations any longer.  Therefore I decided the benefits out weighted the fact I was dropping pounds.  I can't thank Dr. Kwan enough for showing me how to take my life back.  When we feel good, we tend to have a more positive outlook about our lives and for me I'm experiencing less personal stress and I'm helping others by sharing what I've done to turn my health and weight goals around.   Thanks, Dr. Kwan for having faith and patience in me.Thanks so Much!Darlene James~~#~1
One of my friends took my to YC's years ago during my time at ASU. I was skeptical and scared to try something new. Since then this has remained one of my favorite places to eat.The place looks very confusing to new comers, so it's always good to go with a YC's veteran to show you the ropes. :) Take as much meat as you want, as much veggies, noodles and then it's up to you to make your own mixture of saucy goodness before handing it over to the good people that man the frying station. They have a plethora of great ingredients to make a delicious sauce for your stir fry. Ginger, Orange, Garlic, Sweet and Sour, and lots others. Above the cooking stations are steps to make different styles of sauce, but I always like going with my instincts and making my own. It's just more fun. They also have soup, chinese noodles and white, brown rice to go with your meal and a drink comes with the cost. Love that. I always leave full and usually have lots leftover to bring home. Its fun to get creative with your food here, watch it being cooked, and loving how it tastes. All for a great price. I can't say enough great things about YCs.~~#~1
Awesome disc shop! This is by far the best disc golf store I have ever been to. The people are friendly and very helpful. The discs are good prices and they have a great selection. Also if you get some new discs and want to try them out they are right next to a great course with some fun and difficult water holes. Now get out there and throw a disc!~~#~1
Well...these days it is difficult to find anything positive to report about an airline. US Airways delivers nuts and bolts in an average way (meaning the plane works technically and delivers you to your destination for a reasonable price). Mostly on time. They could stand out from this averageness, however, if they would not make so many Nickeling and Diming efforts. For example the seat selling techniques applied are just downright counterproductive. When checking in on line, all seats except the pre-assigned center seats (different rows, even though we bought tickets together) were $15. This, of course, to compel you to spend another $30 to sit with The Wife (yes, $30, since there was no purchaseable seat right next to one of the pre-assigned centers....psychology, anyone??). Then, we were almost late at the airport, but still went to the underused check-in counter. We asked if we could sit together. Result: Reclining exit row seats for free in a half-full plane.Then we proceeded through the half empty airport and found out that we could actually go on a 1hr earlier plane, which was not full. However, the representative at the gate wanted $50 per ticked to make this change...again the Nickel and the Dime! Do they realize how bad this looks? Letting us on would not have cost anything, but would have left us with a happy memory...corporate numb nuts! Anyway, we went for coffee, saved the $100, and went on the booked plane. Can't be Nickeled and Dimed!More from the US Airways front (6/2011). It appears that they are stepping up their "force people to check bags to collect more revenue" efforts. Sitting at the gate, the loudspeaker blasted something like: "If your bag exceeds the size box and you will not check it right now, but wait until we detect your outsize-baggage-sneaking-in attempts at the gate when boarding, you will be charged for the bag when we check it in"-very nice. Several people immediately ran to the counter and checked their bags (for free). Then, when finally boarding my bag was singled out and put towards the "sizer". It was slightly too thick, and the clerkess immediately blasted: this must be checked...but then she got distracted, and another less-eager clerkess winked at me and indicated me to move on the plane...lucky me!Bottom line: It ain't getting better in those 'friendly skies'! Fly Southwest if you can!~~#~0
Local local local.....all treats are made from scratch :) around the holidays you can buy homemade pumpkin pie made from scratch. Great patio for beautiful Phoenix days and awesome place for your dog to hang out with you.~~#~1
I go here for lunch all of the time!  I LOVE the lemongrass tofu, the thai iced tea is delicious and I have heard that the shrimp is amazing.  I don't know, because I have never tried anything except for the tofu, it is delicious, i just can't break away. What really makes this place great for lunch is that it is cheap and quick. This place gets two thumbs up from me!~~#~1
I haven't eaten Chinese take out like this since I live back east.  The food is delicious and the price is perfect.  I've been eating here since they opened 3 years ago and haven't found anyone that does it better.~~#~1
I so far have been to the Phoenix Market off 721 N. central That market has a lot to choose from.But this time i went to check out the central famers market off 7901 N.Central.I very much enjoyed this market it seems to not be as hectic.That have an excellent selection of vegetables.That are in side and out side fresh eggs baked goods and food trucks.For myself it is a lot easer to go this that location.Note i am driving from Peoria. This is there web site http://centralfarmersmarket.com/~~#~1
5 reasons to go to the vig:1. it's outdoors w/heating lamps...which is PERFECT for AZ weather in the fall & winter...LOVE IT! 2. it has a bocce ball court...drinking while chucking heavy balls on grass...LOVE IT! 3. it has this (heavenly) chocolate brownie dessert...sharing is difficult...LOVE IT! 4. it's really close to postino's...makes a great night...LOVE IT! 5. it has the vig rig...which will shuttle your intoxicated self home (running on tips only!)...LOVE IT! with those 5 reasons need I say any more?~~#~1
I almost felt underdressed walking into the Mesa location of one of my very favorite eateries. Being used the to hot, crowded, loud Tempe location, hubski and I showed up in our jeans and ratty we-were-thinking-about-going-to-bed-but-decided-to-go-Cornish-style-instead shirts.In this location, the owners had a little- ok a lot- more space to be creative. The seats are church pews. There are candles in wine bottles. I won't ruin everything for you, but just look closely at the tables.Although the space is larger, the decor helps to maintain the cozy comfortable quality we love about Cornish-Tempe.I ordered the Spicy Asiago Chicken- veggie style. Hubski got the veggie tikka masala. They were both delicious, as always. We went back with a friend a couple of nights later and ordered the caramel apple pasty and the banoffee pie. They were out of bananas so they substituted strawberries. It was tasty, but bananas really belong to that confection. The apple caramel pasty was PMS-licious!We love this place and we'll be back soon... maybe tonight!Oh- and a shoutout to Lindsay B.- no trans fats in sight!~~#~1
Terrible!  Just terrible!  Poorly organized from the minute you drive up to the place.  Where do I begin?  The layout of the place is in NO WAY set for a festival for hundreds of people.  The "convenience" shuttles were not-so-convenient, as there were only 6 operating for the HUNDREDS of people needing pick-up and drop-off. (It was faster to actually walk back to our vehicle.) The ticket line was convoluted and chaotic; there was no order to the line & one of the cashiers didn't have any one's so he motioned for people to get in another (so-called) line.  The balloons were never blown up, as it was apparently too windy to inflate them (although the wind was minimal in my opinion).  It's like - Duh - don't have a balloon festival in a place known for high desert winds and is in no way set-up for hot air balloons!  The vendors sucked.  The band sucked. The employees/volunteers couldn't answer any of my questions. About the only thing good to come out of the event was that their beers were decent and you get to see the grounds of the Carefree Resort.  Other than that?  No Thank You!~~#~0
Love it here...  So many things to see, so many things to touch, and so many things that I can buy at a reasonable price!  Found a ton of things for stocking stuffs...  I am coming back soon to get some xmas shopping done.~~#~1
Very nice staff always clean when I go in here. Really good froyo and good flavor selection~~#~1
Ok, some of the salsa sound a little strange. Try them. They are awesome. Mole tacos are delicious, so are the dog fish ones. The burros are huge. Great service, even when busy. The horchata is a nice way to finish a meal.~~#~1
I take my wife here all the time.  It's a great date place.  The food is always good and the staff is always knowledgeable of the wines and paring them with foods.  We haven't had a bad glass or bottle yet.  My wife likes to order their Cherry Lemon Drop Martini and I have to admit I enjoy it too.The food is always prepared with care and I've always enjoyed a cheese plate or a Flight of wines with their recommended cheese pairings.I would like to extend my kudos to Barry.  He is the reason I kept returning as he has what it takes to take the front of the house experience to the next level.~~#~1
This is what neighborhood Phoenix / Scottsdale needs.  An outdoor farmer's market is perfect for this Arcadia area and more like it need to be opened throughout Phoenix metro area.  This small Saturday morning market is a small peek into what Saturdays in France or Italy are like.  People milling around, socializing, eating, drinking.... eating.  We walk there anytime my wife and I have the day off and just enjoy ourselves.  We share tables with strangers, strike up conversations with everyone, read the paper and just enjoy the market with no agenda.  Thank you Vincent.~~#~1
I'll stay here again, hands down.  I can't thank Derek and his staff enough for the excellent service we had during our three night stay.  Very welcoming staff. The shuttle picked us up at the airport and offered to take us to our off site rental car location.  We were allowed to check in early.  Anything we needed Derek made it happen.  The rooms were clean, comfortable perfect for us to come back and relax after the long days we had.  I just wanted to say that it was a very wonderful experience to stay here.  Derek made the trip less stressful making sure we got to where we needed to go.  Keep up the good work, its rare to find that kind of customer service these days.~~#~1
Sushi places are a dime a dozen in this town, and in my mission to try them all, I met a friend at Stingray for happy hour.  The food was decent.  I've certainly had better.  The las vegas roll was a little heavy on the rice and tempura.  The drinks were exceptionally good.  I had the asian blonde, which is lychee and champagne, can't go wrong there.  My friend's drink was something with raspberries and rose water.  It was amazing.  All that being said, the service was awful.  Once our food was delivered our waitress disappeared.  I got one refill on my water, and considering that I drink water like its going out of style, this is completely unacceptable.  My empty glass sat on the edge of the table for the remainder of dinner.  Once we were done eating, we couldn't get the bill, as our waitress was still missing.  Some 20+ minutes after we were completely done eating she appeared again, and we requested the bill.  Once the bill arrived, it took the waitress an additional 15 to 20 minutes to come pick it up.  It was taking so long that I actually held the bill and credit cards up and out past the edge of the table, hoping someone passing by would offer to take it, or atleast offer to send our waitress over. Busboys went by, the hostess went by several times, other waitresses went by,  the manager even went by, and they all pretended like they didn't see me holding the bill.  I've never had such a difficult time trying to get someone to take my money; it was truly infuriating.  Stingray is definitely getting crossed off my list.  I don't have time for bad service.~~#~0
Excellent fish tacos (including a mahi-mahi variety if you're into that).  I really like the salsa bar, not too overwhelming, just the right amount of condiments to choose from.  This place was a godsend when looking for a quick bite in downtown Phoenix.  Every other place I walked by looked really beat.~~#~1
Go to the most expensive restaurant you can find.  Order the most expensive King Salmon you can get.  It still will not compare to what you can buy from Alaskan Pride!  We purchased our first fish from them on Saturday, June 23 and ate it last night.  In the toaster oven until the fish just started to flake.  It was the most delicious fish I have ever eaten.  We purchased while at the Central Farmers Market (Central & Northern Avenues) open each Saturday morning.We WILL be back this week for more!~~#~1
fresh chicken and the dipping sauce is awesome. sounds funny but they have the best ice for drinks~~#~1
It's better than anything in Philly, and, according to my friend who had grown up in SF proper, it's better than anything there as well. I imagine that only LA and Toronto would have better!The boba is freaking amazing. It's almost honeyed (lightly), with a soft, melt-in-your-mouth quality. They come in their own juices at the bottom, which is fabulous mixed or as a standalone (if you like drinks such as lemonnanas).Also, for the lactose intolerant, this place is ideal. They serve boba drinks in true Korean fashion: lots of fruit and ice, and nothing else. While the fruit isn't gourmet quality (most of it was probably frozen stuff), it's delicious and much better for you than milk if you have any aversion to it. I remember being degraded by my friend when I tried to order the same thing at a Chinese place and they put in 2 kiwi quarters and a crapton of ice. It sucked, so I'm happy this place exists to prove my point!Go here. I drove 23 minutes the first time just for this, and came back 3 times in 1 week.~~#~1
Best lowe's ever . People are nice and proffesional and they exactly know what they're doing. Defenitely a 5 stars.~~#~1
Just went here for lunch and this place rocks. the meat was soooo GOOD and they had some of the softest & freash Fata cheese i have ever had!~~#~1
This place is my "old stand by," and somehow I end up here 1-2 times a week. I have tried maybe half of the menu by now, and I always gravitate to the Hummus Plate Salad.  It is so delicious. Vegetarian friendly, though I am a meat lover, and full of roasted veggies, hummus, perfect balsamic vinagrette and nine grain bread. Heaven on a plate :) And for under $10!!~~#~1
'Tis the season and I'm trying to shop local as much as possible...It's challenging, however, to shop local particularly when on the hunt to furnish a nursery, and especially when you can find big box stores that carry anything and everything you could ever imagine at pretty low prices.We're planning for the arrival of baby #2 in March, so I've recently been doing a ton of research on nursery necessities.  It hit me over the last few weeks that I needed to get my act together and order a crib and dresser.  The problem was, I had my mind set on ordering something grey, and since the gender of the baby is going to be a surprise, it had to be universal - not too masculine or too feminine.I did find a couple of local stores that carried nice lines, and of course there were also some options at big box stores like Buy Buy Baby and Restoration Hardware.  However, when an out-of-state friend of mine suggested I look into a particular crib she'd found, I did some more research, and that led me to Crismon's Baby Boutique.  It turns out that Crismon's not only carries all kinds of children's clothing and accessories and specializes in Christening outfits, but they also offer competitively priced furniture and gifts!  I was very happy to learn that they work with Franklin & Ben, a really unique nursery collection that I initially found online and through my friend in Chicago.  When I called to inquire and learn more, I spoke to Lisa, and she was extremely helpful.  My husband and I went in and met Lisa in person and several days later, we decided to place an order.So at the moment, we're playing the waiting game, but I can't wait to furnish the nursery with an awesome convertible crib and double wide dresser in a gorgeous weathered grey color from Crismon's.Crismon's is a family-owned business serving the Phoenix area since 1979.  Check their hours before you head over to visit, as I believe they are only open Wednesday - Saturday.  I'll update this review once I receive our purchase, but so far, I've been extremely pleased with the service I've received.  Fingers crossed for a five star update (and a five star baby too!)~~#~1
Mango wango is awesome. I have been here a dozen times it is fun, lively every time. Staff has always been good and nice.~~#~1
Absolutely terrible. I am fond of wood burned pizza, don't get me wrong. But the wait was atrocious--2 hours just to get a table. Then we were rushed in and out and told to scoot our chairs in--The place is way too small! There are so many better places to go that need the money--I dislike trendy places that are too crowded were they treat you like an average widget to milk money from.~~#~0
This update is not because I went back to Rosie's, but to share the comment I received from my server. I really think it's in poor taste she felt the need to contact me and makes me NEVER want to give business to Rosie's ever again.In my review I relayed the events as they happened, I'm not going to sugar coat it. I still think the cost of my friends drinks should not have been charged to me and it's not that my friends are "unreliable dining compainions", it was not their fault their drinks were not charged to them and they didn't notice. The server is the one who rang up the order and made the mistake, she should own up to it, not blame my friends or get pissy with me.It's really too bad that I don't want to give my business to Rosie's because I really do like it there and I really wasn't that upset with the server, just the situation. I still stand by the fact the drinks wrongfully charged to me should not have been my responsiblity. Doesn't matter if the drinks belonged to my friends, I shouldn't have had to pay for the mistake the server made. Here is her comment:I was your server that evening and do not appreciate that you feel servers should have to pay out of our own pockets for your friends mistakes.  We seperate checks to make things more convienent for you.  Most places do not allow split checks.  I am sorry your friends skipped out on their portion of the tab.  Maybe you should find more reliable dining companions. As for the one beer on your tab, that indeed was my mistake and if my memory serves me correctly, i quickly and kindly apologized for MY mistake and swiftly removed it from your tab without any friction. Can't wait to see you again soon.  Rosie's always tries to give a good experience to it's customers.~~#~0
This place is the gosh darned bomb.  The food here is so crazy good I can't even begin to describe it.  To boot, they have Strongbow cider on tap, happy hour daily from  3 to 6, and the most unbelievable pasties we've had outside of Truro, Cornwall.  And that's not even mentioning the Shirley Temple pudding.....The food is rib-sticking and makes you feel like you are lying down on a soft couch and blanket when you eat it.  There is a type of pasty for everyone here, so don't read any more.  Just go.  In the entire valley, this is our 2nd favorite place (the first being a local pizza joint, Palermo's.)  The kids working at the place might be a bit young, brash, and stoner-looking, but the owners and recipes are faultless.  We have been here avout 20 times in the last 2 years, and every time the experience is the same.  Go.  Now.~~#~1
It was confusing at first since there were two Garcia's at the same location. But it wasn't hard to figure out the sit-down one was the one without the drive-thru. Prices, portions, food, and service were great.~~#~1
I LOVE Zuma. I hate the celebrity bar tending night which is possibly Wednesday? But, I love the regular staff that you encounter on any normal night. While in school I lived in walking distance from Mill and Zuma quickly became my favorite bar. I was able to celebrate my 21st birthday here and then continue the tradition of coming here ritually every weekend for an entire year - oftentimes during the week too. The bartenders (Chuddy, Tommy, Tony, Mike) are all so friendly and easy to talk to that they are half the reason we came so much and so early. Most people don't start the party until later but we were always at Zuma during happy hour or for burgers just to hang out. Once everyone does pile in - it gets very crowded and very loud. You should get bottle service. It helps a lot and if you're tired of dancing you can sit down and drink. I love this place and can't wait to go back and see everyone! Oh, plus - if you can stand the smell of alcohol after a night of slamming it back, they have unbelievable burger baskets. I believe it's 3 toppings on your burger (including cheese/avocado/bacon & many others) plus fries for 5 bucks. Talk about a deal and something great for a hung over stomach.~~#~1
Only a year old, this hotel boasts tastefully decorated, clean amenities and a very friendly staff. There is a complimentary breakfast in the AM's from 6-9:30am which serve eggs, bacon, sausage, fruit, toast...even gravy and biscuits! (if you like that kind of thing...which the hubs does) And in the evening from 5-6pm, they offer a complimentary cocktail hour where they serve beer and wine. And the owner/manager converses with the guests to ensure they are enjoying their stay or to alert them of local attractions.This is really a great (and SUPER clean) hotel in a perfect location. Guests can walk across to the library, lake, tennis facility, museum, waterpark or next door to the stadium. Or just take a leisurely day to lay out by the pool in the sunshine!If you are staying in Surprise...THIS is the place to stay!~~#~1
My inner-nerd was excited to hear about NTN Buzztime and team trivia so I was stoked to come down and try this place out.  I wasn't stoked, however, to learn that NTN and team trivia were two different things.  And I wasn't stoked to wait 10 minutes for our server to wipe down our sticky table.Regardless, this place's parking lot was packed and the bar was buzzing with Thursday night football and baseball fans drinking down pitchers and pints.  Aside from the pool table and shuffleboard, as if that alone wasn't awesome enough - they have FOOZBALL too!!The food and service was pretty average. I ordered a grilled chicken and ortega chile  sandwich with Monterey jack cheese.  It tasted pretty bland - I ate only half, which if you know me, means it must have been pretty blah.  The fries were the zesty seasoned variety - probably frozen, but were still pretty good.  Rum and cokes here were standard as well.  Glasses were shorter than expected, but neither too weak, nor too strong. Now to the trivia.  It's team driven and can go kind of slow.  So the bigger the group at the table, the more brainpower (but also, the more likely for differing answers and arguments).  For my friend and I, who thought we were at a disadvantage - we coasted to 3rd place (out of 10).  Not too bad, and we won a gift certificate back to Hazelwoods.  I'll use it someday I'm sure.  Like when I'm in the neighborhood or something.  Not in a big rush. P.S.  It was Grover who was on the cover of Sesame Street Fever, in case you're wondering.EDIT: 11/07Ok, I'm downgrading to a one-star review, which is for the understaffed Saturday when I went to watch Big-Ten football and have some lunch with a gift certificate.  One server to about 30 people in the entire restaurant portion.  To add insult to injury, I paid with a $10 GC and left a $2 tip for an $8 lunch and the server chased me out when I left and couldn't wait any longer.  Service was so slow and the attitude of the server toward me in the parking lot was uncalled for.~~#~0
I went to this location because of a Groupon offer.  It's just a little strip-mall joint with zero atmosphere, but I planned to take the pizza to-go anyway.  I ordered a thin-crust pizza and after waiting 25 minutes, I was told that they had burned it and they had to start over.  Reluctantly, my family and I waited for another pizza.  This time it took 30 minutes and although I had specifically ordered the pizza cut into slices, they cut it into squares.  So yes, a whole hour to wait for a pizza.After all that, the pizza wasn't even very good (the sauce has no zing - tastes just like tomato sauce). Bottom line is that I would never go back to this place again.~~#~0
What can I say....I LOVE the clothes/shoe/etc. selection and pricing at Ross!~~#~1
The best Thai food in the valley.  Small family run business, great food and awesome service.  When it gets busy it may take a little longer, but worth every minute.~~#~1
BUMMER ?I had high hopes for this place. I actually drove by once a week to check on the construction progress before they opened. Perfect location, craft beer, outside seating, old red brick building atmosphere! I was stoked! Long story short: I have tried the food and beer here four times over several months and it is not good. And what is with those baby diarrhea green walls and chairs, talk about a 100 year old red brick wall buzz kill. Service is really slow and blah. It is like they hire just anybody and then turn them loose without any training. I may try them again in a year or two. I am really bummed...this place had a lot of potential.~~#~0
This is the best airbrush tanning studio in Arizona!  Donna is awesome, and the prices are very reasonable, especially the all-you-can tan package for $50.00!  The staff is very friendly and accommodating.   I love being able to book appointments online using Vagaro, as my work schedule changes constantly with meetings, etc, so I can adjust my appointments as necessary. Without them, I would be very sad and pale.~~#~1
Tried this place out a couple weeks ago with my Fiancee. She is Vegan, I am not, but I'm very open to meat alternatives. We both really enjoyed our food. We started with the spring rolls, which had an excellent dipping sauce. I had the Jasmine Ice Tea that had a great flavor for an unsweetened Ice tea. My fiancee ordered the Sweet and Sour "Chicken" and really liked it, which is good as sometimes she does not like the fake meat. I ordered the Spicy Cha Cha, which is breaded soy shrimp. The breading was well seasoned, crispy and not greasy. I used the spring roll dipping sauce for the shrimp and would recommend getting a dipping sauce with this dish. All in all it was great experience. My fiancee's only suggestion is the have more veggie dishes not based on fake meats.~~#~1
Oh man...where do I start? This had to be the worst dining experience of my life. We show up and it's a 25-minute wait for two. Okay, that's normal. But wait, you have to stand outside, and it was 109 degrees today. They had a canopy set up, gee thanks! But how about a glass of water while I wait? Not here! I'm so glad I had a little bit of iced tea left in my cup from AJ's this morning.So we get seated; get this, outside under an enclosed wooden canopy! Who does that to their patrons in Phoenix in the summer? They had misters, but they were nowhere near us. They had a fan mounted on the patio roof, but it blew right over the top of us and did no good. I think they sell portable evaporative coolers at Home Depot. That would have been nice!So I'm looking at the menu and trying to decide what I want to eat when I see the waitress bring out an order to a table near us. I'm a bacon freak and I love it extra crispy. The order she brought out had bacon and it was cooked to perfection! Things were starting to look up. When she set the small plate down in front of the little girl, I didn't think anything of it. It was an adequate portion...for a nine year old.  We'll return to this in a moment. So the waitress takes our order and I excuse myself to use the washroom and wash my hands. So I ask where the washroom is, thinking it's inside. I was politely told it was located in the back...As in, go outside, around the back, and there you'll see them. As I walk around the corner, I suddenly feel as if I'm entering a washroom at a grungy service station. The washrooms weren't clean, weren't air conditioned, and the urinal didn't flush. Can you see where this is going?So back to my seat, our order arrives, and guess what, it's the same size as what I had earlier thought was a kid's portion.  I'm so glad it was hot and I wasn't super hungry.So how was the food? Well, the eggs were runny, the hash browns were completely overdone on the outside, but still raw on the inside, and the bacon...well, let's just say that a couple of Band-Aids and that pig would be out wallerin' around in the mud again.I'll admit. I should have done a little research on my part before eating here, but I seriously doubt I'll go back. At least Denny's is consistent and has clean bathrooms.  I'll give the place one star because at least they had two cool photos of Marilyn Monroe in the Men's Room.~~#~0
I was going back and forth between giving Old Town Whiskey 4 or 5 stars, but the clincher was the fact this place offers a yelp deal (free order of tater tots w/check-in), and since we came in close to when the kitchen was closing (actually, I think it had already closed) they gave us TWO free orders!I like whiskey, but would hardly consider myself a connoisseur so normally I wouldn't seek a place like this out. My friends who I was with are big whiskey fans, and one of them recommended this place.  It's located in the Saguaro hotel (I didn't realize this place is no longer The James), and it had a very loungey, comfy feel to it.  It's not huge, but it's still a fun place to go to w/a large group.It wasn't very crowded when we were here on a Saturday, which may have been part of the reason we had such great service, but either way, our waiter was attentive. I had a couple of "Old Town Sazerac's (which is the Old Town Whiskey way of saying...you guessed it...a sazerac ). They were yummy. Like I said earlier, I don't know whiskey, but my friends who I was here with say this place has a very good selection and they enjoyed there cocktails as well.If you're looking for a place in Old Town, that's a bit more laid back, yet "classy," Old Town Whiskey is great spot!~~#~1
love the weekend buffet in the bistro, very nice service and the most delicous fluffy pancakes ever...omellette chefs are very funny and make very tasty eggs for you on the spot...good coffee..Nice fireworks display as well...very impressive~~#~1
5 stars for the one of the Best Damm Happy Hour's in the Valley. When it comes to doing happy hour there is only one spot that comes to mind, Roaring Fork has the best deals going whether it is the Green Chili, the Flat bread or the Big Ass Burger these items are fantastic and the Prickly Pear Margarita is a must try... this place is a home run, and they are doiting it every night in the bar for the summer, which means Elliot and the gang down there will be seeing a lot more of us..~~#~1
Absolute garbage. Food isn't there at all, cold, old, and over saturated with bell peppers. Service is nonexistent by both servers and management. This place really gives the Scottsdale quarter and the city of Scottsdale a bad name. Just let it go already and let another restaurant take over.~~#~0
Fresh food made with free range, hormone and antibiotic free meat.  The service was good and the items we ordered (falafel wrap and chicken pasta salad special) was delicious.  The portions were generous, and the flourless chocolate cake was worth every calorie.  We ate outside, and while not a fancy patio, it was nice.  I'll definitely go back.~~#~1
I adore Ikea-just adore it! Its for the people like me who like the idea of dreaming and see these rooms all put together and you imagine it in your home and yet for thousands less compared to other places!How can you do wrong? Seriously you put everything together with an Allen wrench! I am surprised when people don't like Ikea-I would gladly take an ikea makeover.  I have so much fun browsing but you do have to browse.  It's fun and you never know what you'll find.Yesterday I found $5 wok seriously how can you go wrong with a $5 wok! Time to make some stir fry's.I love looking at all the furniture and bed set and pillows etc.This place is amazing and I enjoy it so much.Their website is great and I love doing the room on the website check out that by the way!We had a great time there! Can't wait to take my fiance back with a tape measure!!~~#~1
I live right by Amore so when they opened up I decided to give them a try.  The first time we ordered from Amore we got a pizza.  It was mediocre.  What really struck me was the service.  The young man at the register was outside talking to his friends and texting when I got there.  It took him at least two minutes to come back inside and help me and when he finally did he was rude!The second time I went in I ordered pizza and wings.  When I got there once again I had to wait for the person working the register to stop chatting on his phone to serve me.  My pizza was ready but they hadn't even started my wings.  I sat and watched them make my wings.  I almost told them to just forget it because they wings looked horrible.  They were pale and they used an already used bowl to coat them in buffalo sauce.  I literally live 2 minutes and when I got home my pizza was cold, I was also concerned the wings were undercooked so I cut one open first to check.  I was right!  They were completely raw on the inside.  I had to put them in the oven for at least another 30 minutes and they were still so greasy and terrible I ended up picking off all the chicken meat and feeding it to the dogs!I must be a glutton for punishment because I tried them a third time and once again had a terrible experience.  I didn't have to wait at the register and this time the cashier was actually friendly.  My husband and I ordered a pizza, salad, and garlic bread.  When I got home I realized I had never gotten the salad.  I was back there less than 10 minutes of leaving and I told him he had forgotten to give me my salad.  He basically accused me of trying to get a free salad off of him!  He tried to tell me I had never ordered a salad.......At first I thought he was kidding but then I realized he was serious!  We had ordered online so I told him just to check their online order log.  He told me that wasn't possible.  Then I told him to just look at my receipt!  It should be at the top of their garbage can since I watched him throw it away.  He glanced in the garbage bin and told me it wasn't there.  I had my credit card receipt and I showed it to him.  I asked him how it could possibly be that much if I hadn't ordered a pizza bread and salad since the salad was $8.  I had to sit there arguing with him for almost 10 minutes before he'd give me my salad.  If you want to avoid bad food and TERRIBLE service then avoid this place at all costs!!If you're in the area and really have a pizza craving go to Bashas!  They sell whole pizzas and pizza by the slice and it's actually very good and you'll receive five star+ service.~~#~0
Good coffee, a great tea selection, and easy access to great cookies from Sweet Pea.  The people are extremely friendly and it's a nice comfortable space to spend time.The hours seem a bit limited, but I'm never in that area during their off hours, anyway.~~#~1
I think I've already wrote a review for Total Wine, but figured I'd write another for this new Scottsdale/Shea location, as it is closer to me and will probably be my new location to go to.I love that they put it in literally right behind BevMo....take that BevMo!  I cannot see how the heck BevMo will even stay in business with Total Wine right behind them.  The selection at TW is light years ahead of BevMo's....but even better, TW's prices are insane cheap compared to BevMo.If you need alcohol/wine, look no further.....drive right past BevMo and go to Total Wine, you will not come out of the store empty handed.~~#~1
In the years I've been enjoying the valley bar scene I've almost always avoided Mill avenue.  The exception to that rule is and always will be The Big Bang!  I love this place.  I hadn't been in a while but went back last weekend and remembered why I love this place so much.  Everyone you deal with that works there is super fun and nice.  The atmosphere is amazing, it forces you to not take yourself to seriously, just enjoy the night!  Drinks are tasty and reasonably priced in my opinion.  The entertainers are hands down amazing!  I had such a great time!~~#~1
This was one of my favorite restaurants when I lived in Phoenix, and one that I make sure to visit whenever I return. A local Phoenix chain, Pita Jungle has started to branch out to southern California, and I just wish they would make their way east to Chicago. The Indian School location is my favorite, but at each location in the Valley you can find quality food and attentive, friendly wait service. Their falafel and classic hummus are both very good, but my favorites are located in the "Healthy Burgers" section of the menu. Their veggie burger is excellent, but their chipotle black bean burger is sheer joy, striking a nice balance between spicy and sweet with the inclusion of dried cranberries. If interested in something lighter, try their Caribbean salad, which is a salad of fresh fruit topped with coconut and strawberry dressing. It makes for an enjoyable dish during those hot Phoenix summers. Other favorites of mine include their nachos, mixed beans, lentils and rice, and their garlic new potatoes. The decor of their Valley locations is a good balance of fashionable and relaxed. Pita Jungle is definitely a great place for lunch or a casual dinner with friends, or just to eat out on your own and enjoy excellent food made with fresh ingredients. I love Pita Jungle!~~#~1
Have you tried their  banana coconut cream pie???? Get your butt over there and get it. There was even a layer of chocolate in there !! That is insane ....it was insane and only $6. Go get it right now.~~#~1
Great BBQ exists in Mesa, AZ because of Famous Dave's. The service was great, and the food was even greater. I ordered the St. Louis Ribs Combo with the Georgia chopped pork. Both were delicious! For the sides, I had the beans and the mac & cheese. No complaints here. Just come with an empty stomache, so that it can be made FULL!~~#~1
I love this place! I've been here twice for lunch and once for dinner and have yet to be disappointed.The last time I went here, I got the fried egg sandwich for lunch - it was very good. A bit messy though - I had to eat it with a fork and knife. The fries are great too. I've also had the flatbread before, which I enjoyed. And I ordered the salmon when I was here for dinner which was quite good.It's the perfect place for lunching on the patio with a glass of wine. I haven't tried their brunch yet, but I hear it's amazing. Hopefully I'll be back soon for that.~~#~1
First of all, I have to give our server Rejeana five stars for herself.  Within two minutes of being seated she appeared, a petite, bubbly and very informative young lady. She gave a very clear explanation of the beers, and menu and also asked if we were going to the game, since it was close to starting time.  We were not, but we're impressed that she would inquire.  Our drinks and meals appeared quickly even though the restaurant was quickly filling up.  Every time Rejeana passed our table she checked on us.To start with we ordered the crab, lobster, artichoke dip which was excellent.  There were four of us, I ordered the Mac and cheese and a ranch salad.  The salad was fresh and of a good size for an appetizer salad and my adult Mac and cheese was saucy with plenty of chicken, bacon and mushrooms.  I will enjoy the leftovers.  It was delicious.  Another tried the pepperoni pizza which he said was equally as good as any he had had.  He also enjoyed his caesar salad.  One had the clam chowder, yum, with the fish and chips which was a very large order.  He totally enjoyed it.  And the fourth of our party had the tomato bisque which she said was the best she had ever tasted, and also had an order of the crab cakes which she totally enjoyed.  Two of us are foodies  from the Napa Valley in California and we are very spoiled with five star restaurants surrounding us.  The food we enjoyed  at your restaurant this evening was equal to what we enjoy at home.  Kudos to you!~~#~1
I'll keep this short - do NOT sign up for Sprint service while living in Phoenix, AZ. They do not plan on rolling out 4G LTE in the Phoenix metro area until late 2013 at the very earliest. 4G is not currently available. 3G service is spotty and slow. Calls drop constantly, dead zones everywhere. There is nothing you can do as a customer to get out of your contract after the initial return period, either. I had AT&T for nearly ten years before switching to Sprint, and I made the switch to save a few bucks a month. Huge mistake. See recent service comparisons in Phoenix here:http://www.rootmetrics.com/compare-carriers/phoenix/phoenix-october-2012/http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2405622,00.aspOnce again, stay away from Sprint in Phoenix.~~#~0
Visiting Taliesin West played a big part in my decision to come to AZ on vacation.  I have been to several of his homes this year and it seemed like a good way to end the year.  The property and home is absolutely amazing.  I've been to Fallingwater and Taliesin West is every bit as breathtaking.  I took the 90 minute insights tour which takes you around the exterior and the interior highlights include the living room and FLW's bedroom.  The fee is $24 but you can't put a price on being exposed to a work of art and pure uninhibited genius.  No other FLW home that I've been to allows interior photography without doing an in-depth tour but interior photography was allowed at Taliesin West.  I was over the moon, like a kid in a candy store.After a 30 minute break, my friend and I opted to do the 2 hour Apprentice Shelter Tour. It's $30 and a must for anyone into design or architecture.    Taliesin West houses the Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture - it has a max of 25-30 students, or apprentices as FLW would call them.  An apprentice serves as the docent which is really neat because you get a student's perspective.  Our apprentice was over here from China.  We got to view over a dozen of the 30 or so desert shelters that apprentices have designed, built and lived in over the last several decades.  We got to get up close and view the structures from tents to large glass and metal cantilevered studio homes.  Apparently each apprentice who opts to build their design receives $1,000 in seed money but many try to get donations.  One of the homes cost over $15K to produce.  The works are very impressive.  Most of the structures have just enough room for a mattress and of course each has a fireplace as an homage to FLW.  It's also nice to hike through the desert.  It's serene and quiet.  Don't miss Taliesin West if you're in the Scottsdale area!!~~#~1
OMGosh...the sesame encrusted salmon with garlic mashed and deep fried spinach is seriously the best combination with salmon I have EVER had. SO good. AND...the spinach salad...the BLT salad...the Black diamond martini...the bread...the steaks....I could seriously go on...and on... and....LOVE Firebirds!!~~#~1

This is the best place in the valley for nails. My sisters and mom go here every Christmas Eve to get pedicures. All the workers are super nice & they did a great job.~~#~1
I have never a review for any Cheesecake, and I realize that I need to write one, even though probably.  I have actually been to this particular location twice for work group events.  I have to say there were impeccable and gave 100% without errors.  Now to the food....Man everything is good here!  I honestly have never had a bad dish or dessert item here.  Even their brown wheat bread tastes superb.  If you are watching calories, then check out another restaurant, lol.~~#~1
Great service. Todd went out of his way to make sure I got a new key-chip made for my car last minute.~~#~1
Beautiful downtown property with amazing guest rooms~~#~1
Awesome! This was one of the first places I tried since moving to Tempe and it is so good. Don't be fooled by the strip mall appearance from the outside, what awaits you inside is the most glorified hot pockets.~~#~1
Bungalow turned cozy, cool neighborhood restaurant with fantastic outdoor dining and intimate indoor spaces.  Pizza is amazing.~~#~1
A few months ago I wrote a very positive review of this place.  Starting about in September, however, something very odd and unpleasant happened to Cheuvront.  The lunch service became slow, to the point where I thought I'd been forgotten.  Worse, the food started to change in unpleasant ways.  Gone were the good ingredients and subtle flavorings.  Suddenly everything was layered on in huge blobs and weighted down with unnecessary spices.Specifically, I'm talking about the lunch pizzas I had for lunch at Cheuvront so many times before.  Last time I went, a few weeks ago, I suddenly noticed that they used nearly four times the cheese necessary.  Today, there was four times the cheese, at least two or three times the sauce, along with chunks of nearly raw garlic.Worse, the cheese on my pizza was cool and congealed, showing that it had been sitting around for a while before the wait staff deigned to bring it to me.I was embarrassed to have suggested to a colleague that we eat at Cheuvront today.  I don't know what happened to this restaurant, but at least the lunch service is a total loss.~~#~0
This is the best Thai food in the East Valley. The food is amazing and  consistent. The Owner is a wonderful Thai woman named Rich who is also the cook. She always comes out of the kitchen, if it is not too busy' to make sure you enjoyed your meal. If you have not had a chance to visit Palee's Crown you are missing out on authentic thai food.~~#~1
Best noodles outside Japan.  Very authentic Japanese style restaurant.  Try the champon noodles...~~#~1
My boy Sonny past away unexpectedly.  I was a mess. Mary opened the doors after hours, she was so gentle with my boy, and so kind to me and my husband. She has so many options to remember your pet, and offers you options, but doesn't push you into anything. She held on to Sonny for a few days for us to decide what we wanted our next step to be. Mary was so compassionate, and she took wonderful care of boy Sonny. I am so thankful for Mary, its hard for most people to understand how much he meant to us, Mary was professional and very sensitive to our needs.~~#~1
Frankie runs a great joint!This place does it right all the way around. You immediately notice that it's a family owned and run business. The pizza crusts are hand tossed and their ingredients are of good quality. The slices of New York Style Pizza fresh out of the oven are top notch!The numerous daily specials are always great! I often get the Ravioli Special that they have, which has many times been Lobster Ravioli, and it's only around $11. I had to try something new on the menu, just out of sheer curiosity, it's called The Big Mama Cheese Steak, with the works, mozzarella sticks, jalapeno poppers, french fries, and marinara sauce all inside the sandwich.It was enormous and I felt like a very bad person for even thinking about eating such a thing. It turned heads and drew a lot of questions and comments from others in the restaurant. Somehow, some way, I finished the entire sandwich, and really did enjoy it.Every joint needs a signature item that catches peoples curiosity, and the Big Mama Cheese Steak is exactly that for Mama MiaI think that that this would be a great item for all of the people in California who have Medical Marijuana Cards...lolCheers! and Thumbs up to Frankie!~~#~1
Amazing experience!  I was looking to sell my 2007 Mazda6 before I moved to Chicago and drove two hours from Sedona down to this store in hopes they would give me a great price. Jason greeted me at the door, set my car up for their estimators, then sat with me for about 45 minutes explaining the process and the options while they estimated the value of my car. Soon, the offer popped up on his computer screen and it was beyond what Ihad hoped and higher than Kelly Blue Book value.  Jason was very excited for me and told me how to complete the process of selling my car to them within the next 7 days if I was interested.  I showed up 6 days later, and within 20 minutes I had a check in my hand for the difference between what I owed on the car and the great price CarMax was paying!  Within a week I received a payoff confirmation from my bank and a check for a refund of some interest on my car loan. Super easy and efficient!Jason and all the employees I encountered at CarMax made it so easy to do this, and they followed through on every promise they made along the way.  I would absolutely do business with them again.~~#~1
Have you ever been to a place & walked out feeling like you were ass raped?  well, if you're into that, you'll love this joint!!!The food is terrible....but I felt even worse because it was expensive for the shit they gave you.  We got a medium sausage, which at any other place is a very small pizza, and it was $22 with tax & tip (no drinks...just water).  Don't be fooled by this "gourmet" shit either.  The crust is tasteless & the quality just isn't there.when I compare this to say Oreganos, they are not even in the same ball league.skip this joint....and save your money.~~#~0
Souper F-ing good!! This place was simply a surprise! We've been to buffets but this one was really good! huge salad on my side and then there is pizza and soups and tacos and pasta and baked potatoes! I usually eat my weight there. I suggest you go there and try.~~#~1
My wife and I went for dinner last night. We got there and where told it would be about 11minuites to be seated. It took 4. Our Waiter (Cameron) was there at the table very quickly. He got our drink order and my Wife ask if they had Prime Rib. Cameron said it was running short. He took our order and was back quickly. They where out of Medium Rare Primerib. He brought us menus again and we started over. In a few minutes he was back with a piece of the oven roasted Fillet. We sampled it and decided to go with that. Cameron was on top of the Ice Tea and service was amazing. The manager stopped by to check on things and I expressed how great Cameron was doing. The manager comped our desert and gave me his card. He said call ahead and they would save some Prime Rib in the future for us. This is the best experience I have ever had at any chain restaurant.~~#~1
Love this place! Great neighborhood hangout and the Mug Club is awesome. The patio is dog friendly too!~~#~1
Review Update - I have now stayed here 6+ times of the past year or two and it really has become a favorite destination! Sitting here now on the patio of my room writing this update after spending the afternoon at the pool.  I really just love the setting here - the hotel and amenities all built into the side of a rocky "butte".   Others have said the the rooms and some areas are a bit outdated - I really don't see this as a big issue as I judge the whole experience of my stay.  The staff here has always been top tier and I appreciate the customer service focus.  We spent three afternoons at the pool this weekend and from day one the staff remembered us and greeted us by name.  Twice they had the kitchen make special orders for what we were in the mood to eat poolside.  My tips: - try to get a patio room, views are amazing and the outdoor area and easy access to the pool are worth the extra $20 a night- explore the entire resort and enjoy the landscape and grounds.  Scenic waterfalls, beautiful sitting areas, and hot tubs hidden throughout the rocky terrain. It is a bigger resort than it may first appear and plenty to see as you walk around.- eat at the Top of the Rock restaurant.  AMAZING VIEWS (there was a lightning storm one night we dined there and is was spectacular).  The food was fantastic as well.On a less positive note..............I find it absolutely ridiculous that they charge for parking here!  It is a remote hotel and with nothing at all close by that would have non-guests trying to park there.  I understand a parking charge in dowtown hotels where parking is a premium, but it is insulting that they add parking on top of the room rates!! Looking forward to our next visit (maybe I will get a Free Parking card)!!~~#~1
I normally dont rate hotels since I stay predominately at Marriotts for my work travel (pet friendly).  This Residence Inn stood out because of the exceptionally friendly staff.  I was meeting a friend in Phoenix and debated staying at the Marriott Camelback Resort (also pet friendly) but we just opted for the Residence Inn since we didnt plan on spending much time at the hotel.  The pet fee is only $25 and they have a designated pet relief area, super pet friendly hotel!  I was impressed, I'm sure Duncan was as well!  Our room was one of the larger suites I've seen at a Residence Inn and the closets were also noticeably larger.   Also the pool was a nice size and not busy at all on the weekend!  The gym isnt large, but the equipment was new and there wasnt ever more than one other person each time I went in.  There isnt a whole lot in walking distance, but overall I was so impressed with this hotel! They also sell beer and wine in the minimart, which sounds insignificant, but was a rather nice surprise!~~#~1
I have been a client of Faith's for five years now. She is a very talented stylists and super sweet. As an educator for Eufora, Faith knows the importance of using quality hair products in and out of the salon. She can help you achieve your healthiest hair and scalp, to look your knock-your-socks-off best! I recommend Faith to anyone looking for an exceptional stylist. As a licensed hair professional, that says a lot.~~#~1
Hello, I've been an old customer since they were located on Indian school. I've been going to tandooori times for past 6 to 7 years but never experienced such a bad customer service from restaurant owner. We were waiting by the bar and the table opened up so we move forward to be seated and another customer grabbed the table without asking anyone else. The ppl worked  there couldn't speak up so we ended up getting a table in the corner. At this point we were waiting there for 45 mins. On top of that another server grabs our food and serves another table. Waiter came and apologized and brought our food out 15 mins later. I ordered vegetarian dish and she comes out with non-veg dish. At this point I'm furious and asked for the food to be waived. Our server calls the owner and he said, "I don't serve free food to my own parents". Denied to give us free food after the whole hoopla and time that was wasted. Me and my husband used to be huge fan and even though my food was served with hair in it once and i let that go BUT this made it all WORST! The owner doesn't know how to treat customer. Do not waste your time and money!!!~~#~0
This is the second time I've been by to fix a bent wheel. The first time they were able to straighten it out, the second time they tried, but needed to get a new one for me. Even though my needs were not big, I felt like I was being treated as if I was spending $2000. When I went to pick up my new wheel, they had had an extra wheel my size lying around that was worth double what I ordered, and gave me the better one instead for the cheaper wheel price. I had previously gotten a quote from Performance Bikes (big chain) and Rage was cheaper, which surprised me. Anyway, I recommend going to Rage, it's better all around.~~#~1
Ate here for the first time, loved it.  Great service, reasonable prices and awesome food.~~#~1
I asked for a call from the owner.  Never heard from them - apparently they don't care either.  I guess that's why their staff don't care either.~~#~0
Just stopped in for my first bagel from The Bagel Man...WOW! I'm confident in saying this was the best bagel I've ever had. I had the everything bagel, toasted, with their scallion cream cheese on the side. First of all, they put toppings on both sides of the bagel, which is awesome! No more debating which half of the bagel to eat first (I'm looking at you, Einsteins everything bagel!) Second, the bagel was perfectly baked, slightly crunchy outside, moist and chewy inside. And the scallion cream cheese was the icing in the delicious bagel cake. I also spoke to the extremely friendly owner, and I'm so glad to hear that business is going well for him. The only trouble with this place is it's very close to my office, and I'm afraid of all the money I'm going to be spending here!~~#~1
Finally, a Southeast Asian food pulse around CenPho. When I first moved here, one of the things I noticed was how few choices there were when it comes to Asian cuisine. So nice to see something a little less common like Cambodian food get represented. The spring rolls are a must. For $2, you get a very heavily stuffed roll of rice paper touting chicken, shrimp, cilantro, carrots, etc. The beef salad is also a winner. The seafood soup is flavorful and just might literally nourish the soul. The sandwiches with the pork pate are a great lunch choice. One day, I got one plus a roll to go--all under $6. Of the desserts, everyone should try the sweet and salty corn at least once. The tapioca is my favorite. Light and warm. The best part about eating here is knowing that your money is going toward a very genuine and kind Cambodian family. I have spoken with the chef/owner's son every time I go in. A real sweet guy who will demonstrate how to play the xylophone-esque instrument that is the centerpiece of the main dining room. Speaking of, I love all the touches of decor i.e. travel books on Cambodia at every table. I really, really hope this place does not go the way of some mom-and-pop operations in Phoenix that had really great things to offer. I've been disturbed by the lack of customers I've seen a few times. I want this restaurant to really succeed. I don't want the lines out the door (otherwise I can't get in. ;P) but I want to see a steady stream of patrons. This place really has a chance to be a good-size fish in a big pond. It doesn't fit a cookie-cutter mold and it's got a fantastic bill of fare to show off.~~#~1
Fucking GREAT pizza!  This place rivals Cibo for my favorite pizza in town.  I had a cheese and peperoni pie.  The peperoni was spicy but not over riding so. That sauce was very fruity, the crust perfectly crispy yet soft and flexible.   Wow.The restaurant is very small and tucked into a dirty little strip mall but the inside is nice.  If you love pizza I think you'll LOVE this place.  YUM!~~#~1
I have never been a huge fan of Mediterranean food, but I am officially converted!! Let me start by saying the Gyro house has the best chicken gyro I've ever had!I would definitely agree with the other reviewers that aesthetically, this place is not something to look at. It's located in a small strip mall and the restaurant itself is not the fanciest. However, it definitely has character. It looks like your run-of-the-mill small, local business. The owner was in the store when I went in, and he was super friendly and I received great customer service.Now for the good part... the food! I ordered a chicken gyro with french fries. Both were delish! The chicken was very tender and was served on the fluffiest pita bread I've ever tasted. It was topped with lettuce, tomato, red onion (which I picked off), and tzaziki sauce. I paid about $7.50 for my meal, and it was definitely worth every penny. If you're a fan of a great gyro, this is the place for you!~~#~1
Love the chicken chipotle pizza along with the stuffed pizzas.  There are at least three or four appetizers that are top notch as well.  This place is always crazy crowded, but the food is excellent.~~#~1
Can you say Mama Celeste?This restaurant was so unbelieveably bad I had to whip out my notepad and take notes.  To have the word Chicago anywhere near this menu is downright criminal.  Aside from the frozen grocery store pizza-like cheese (a sprinkle here and there), it had enough salt to melt a Chicago winter's thickest ice covered street in seconds.  I went here today, Sept 3rd for a late lunch.  Alright so I'm on vacation in Scottsdale to scout locations for my future home.  I've spent the past 37 years of my life in Chicago eating pizza (thin crust and stuffed) on a weekly basis.  I read about this place all over and so many people (including some deluded dude at the table next to me) kept raving about how "Chicago" this pizza is.  Oh my goodness!!!!!!!!!  If this is Chicago pizza, kill me now!  this was the worst pizza ever!  I should have known when the waiter guy (a chick appeared later) said in response to our stuffed cheese pizza order, "I don't recommend cheese only".  He said, "if you get cheese only its gets pockets that don't cook all the way and explode when you cut it".  Huh?!  He was going on about this detriment when I finally cut him off and explained that I was from Chicago, wanted to compare stuffed pizzas, never heard of this but was scared so I'll go with the thin crust.  My boyfriend looked puzzled but I flat out told him, "Obviously they don't know what they're doing".  Don't cook all the way?  Explode when you cut into it?  What?!  I appreciate his warning but wonder if he was just trying to up sell since more ingredients equals more $.  If that was the case, his strategy backfired as I went for the thin crust which was cheaper altogether.  As it turns out, I must thank him as Oregano's is a restaurant I wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy.  Bad, bad, bad pizza.  It was actually embarrassing!  As I stated earlier, I overheard a neighbor table mentioning how "Chicago" this pizza was.  He wasn't from Chicago but had been there and had pizza from there and thought this Oregano's pizza was so good. Embarrassing!  I wanted to set him straight so badly but I didn't.  If this is what Arizonians (is that a word?) think Chicago pizza tastes like, I must find a home asap and open a REAL Chicago pizza restaurant.  I'm so embarrassed!  Seriously embarrassed!~~#~0
This was such a beautiful course and you don't really think you are playing in the desert somewhere! There were definitely a lot of holes with water so make sure you bring a lot of balls!! Some were sooooo difficult like the gold course that had the river right behind the hole so if you overshot...say bye bye to your perfectly played ball.  There were a few island holes too esp on a par 3 in the white course.  The people there were sooo friendly and one of my favorite was the fruit scented ice towel the marshall comes to deliver to you!!! MMMMM...it smells soooooooo good!!After the game...make sure you go to Bernards to have their reuben sandwich! It is sooo juicy....the beef just drips down your hand!  BTW, their chicken quesadilla is amazing too! Fried just to a perfect crisp.~~#~1
Take two shots of penicillin and a tetnus shot after eating/drinking here.  And for god's sake stay out of the bathrooms.  Don't believe me, check out the expert reviews on Maricopa.gov, restaurant ratings...pretty yuk!~~#~0
I really like this restaurant. I recommend it to everyone.                                                    We have always had a wonderful time here. Valet parking for starters.                           The Staff is incredible always so helpful and you really enjoy them when you are there.  Kyle was our server this time and he told us about half price bottles of wine on Wednesday.  What a great deal!!!                                                                                     The whole layout of the restaurant is beautiful!!!                                                             The food is so good.       They have some really wonderful and unique dishes.            I can't wait to go back again. It is located on Central and Van Buren beneath the Westin Hotel.  You have to go, you will love!!~~#~1
It's very simple...if you have a Volkswagen and you want it fixed right and you don't want to get gouged, your choices are extremely limited in Phoenix.  Fortunately we have Exklusiv Motorsports.  It's worth the drive from anywhere in the Valley to have Derek take care of your VW.  It's almost mandatory to go here if you have a TDI...all of the dealers in town combined don't have Derek's skill at working on the VW diesels.~~#~1
The yogurt we have here is the best I've had since tcby went under. Pistachio,pumpkin,cakebatter all awesome. The service is first rate, the same lady has waited on us on all of our trips in, and she has not dissapointed. We were sad to see Paciugos go down but have found our new go to place.~~#~1
I've recently moved into the neighborhood and decided to try IHOP today. A big mistake. After I was seated I just waited and waited for someone to take my order. And it's not that they were busy. The place was practically empty. I saw waiters just walking past me avoiding eye contact. They didn't even bother to tell me that someone would be with me shortly or something like that. Customer service anyone?Finally a waitress came along and I told her that I've been waiting for a long time. She was apologetic and nice, and came to check upon me 4-5 times during the meal. But by that time they had totally ruin my Saturday with their pathetic service and "I don't care" attitude. None of the people working there looked like they wanted to be there at all.I'm not going back which is a shame as the place is right next to my apartment.~~#~0
I have been going to EVCC for almost four years and am consistently impressed by the caliber of the doctors and staff. We see Dr. Curran primarily (who is beyond awesome- really helped us gain confidence as first-time parents of a particularly fussy baby), but love to see Dr. Aaron and Dr. Marstiller as well. The doctors all really care about helping parents, are wonderful with the kids and never rush through appointments. The office generally runs on time (we have only had long waits a handful of times) and they are great about getting sick kids in for appointments on short notice. I have recommended this office and Dr. Curran in particular to all my friends, who are all equally satisfied with him and all the doctors. They also do a really great job explaining the purpose of each vaccine, which is helpful when parents hear so much conflicting information on vaccines. These doctors are great (and the nurse, who I've only seen once, was very nice as well) and we could not be happier to find such a great doctor's office!~~#~1
OMG!  We went just for drinks and the sand bag game outside.  A gin and tonic was $10.00!  Four people six drinks later and one sand bag game ...I left there paying $70.00 tip included!!!  Way too much money, I wont order from there again:(~~#~0
Rude staff, slow service.  They wanted me to wait 48 hours for a spring replacement.  I called another company and they came out within 1 hour.  Go anywhere other than Smokey's.~~#~0
We went tonight for the annual Military Appreciation Dinner.  The line was around the building, but they were moving people in and out pretty fast.  The servers and staff along with the JROTC that were volunteers for the evening were very organized and were able to seat people rather quickly.  The food was good, they were maintaining the buffet regularly, and everything was very good.Thank you Golden Corral for supporting the military~~#~1
Amazing customer service.  A day ago I picked up 4 cupcakes for a birthday.   As I entered my house, the box broke due to a lack of adhesive.  I called and they had no problem giving me replacement cupcakes.  They were ready as soon as I came into the store.   Just great!   Thanks again!  Not sure if any other cupcake bakery would do the same, thats why I'll continue to come to Sprinkles!~~#~1
This place is tiny but oh so good.  I love places that have free samples out for you to try when you walk in.  They've got a great selection of healthy options for a lunch that won't leave you feeling all gross for the rest of your work day.  The owner was very friendly with all of us and our food was ready in record time.  I had the #3 sandwich which had turkey, pepper jack, avocado, green pepper, and red onion on wheat bread.  An excellent combination.My eyes were definitely bigger than my stomach, so next time I'll be sure to take advantage of the half sandwich option.  They also have daily soup, sandwich, and salad specials and you can pick two of those for $6.50.  My only suggestion for Breadcrafters is to switch from styrofoam to paper cups.~~#~1
Great atmosphere and service.  Can't waits to come back and try other sandwiches!~~#~1
Holy Mother of Jesus.  I had been to Phoenix before and saw the mountain from across the valley.  Meh.  Sure, it looks kinda cute from over there and makes you want to get closer to take a little snap shot.  Go to the base of the mountain and stare in amazement.  This thing is a beast.  I've been to the Tetons.  I'm been to the Rockies.  Maybe it's the fact that this thing is in the desert.  Or maybe it's because it's covered with cactus.  Or that it's standing alone.  I don't know, but it's stunning.  Stupendous  Stupid me, I didn't bring sensible shoes.  So I wasn't able to make much of a hike, (or at least that's the excuse I'm using).  Maybe next time.~~#~1
We were first ones here for lunch...and kids eat free so I figured why not . I ordered forbidden rice w chicken...it arrrives raw! I had to search for a server and she removed the chicken from my plate...again we wait...and wait...it never came before my meal was finished.  Ha to find another server to ask tjey cxl chicken at this point and just bring bill. They tried to ofer it to go! No thanks...wanted it as part of meal...we will not be back.~~#~0
Noise from other guests running up and down the hall all night.I booked and prepaid for a room with two beds at www.hilton.com.  When I arrived I was informed that they do not have any rooms in inventory with two beds and that sometimes websites get it wrong.Although I am able bodied I was given a handicap room with inconveniences like a shower head that wouldn't go higher than 5'.~~#~0
Best steak I've had in the valley.  Absolutely amazing!  It is super expensive, but the food is delicious, and the ambeince is nice.  A special occasion kind of place, if you have the cash.~~#~1
First of all, Johnny Chu should be ashamed to call himself a chef. He is barely a line cook. As stated in previous reviews, he doesn't even taste his own food (which accounts for the wide margin of variety a single dish may have on two different visits).So, I made reservations, thinking I may be able to sit at the bar because I arrived 10 minutes early. Wrong. I was ordered to wait outside. Nearly 45 minutes later, and a drink at the bar next door, I inquired about my table. The girl didn't even look up at me to acknowledge I had said anything. After a minute or so of staring at her while she continued to ignore me, she finally said my table was ready. Hmm.The food is horrible. I fear those of you who enjoy it, rather enjoy the "atmosphere" and come here to be seen. The food is either completely bland (e.g., my curry, which tasted of water with a slight hint of something I couldn't even recognize) or so hot as to mask any possible flavor. By calling themselves "authentic Asian" cuisine is just silly. There are so many hole-in-the-wall Asian restaurants that could cook Chu under the table blindfolded.So, the rude, nonexistent service, the insanely overpriced food, and to be seen is what you're paying for. If you enjoy being treated like shit and fed food that I wouldn't feed in a troth for pigs--you may enjoy this place and good for you!~~#~0
I had so much fun at NU last night! There was an live auction where you could bid on pieces created by the Crafty Chica (Kathy Murillo). Participation was free and you got a vial of Crafty Chica glitter and a glitterific auction paddle just for registering! My favorite part of the night was watching a lady outbid herself (3x) to win the Glitter Bull Dog..lol. Best of all proceeds went to benefit Valle del Sol. NU is by far my favorite event at the Heard!~~#~1
I can't say much on there quality of service as I have never been to the place, HOWEVER I will comment on their drivers. They are rude and have NO regards for other people they inconvience. I was leaving the local coffee shop in the drive through and right as I started to leave one of their drivers parks his truck right in front making it impossible for me to turn in the direction I needed to go. As the guy got out of his truck I asked if he could move so I could get out, he then (smirkingly) intructed me to go in the opposite direction, clearly not willing to move his truck. I can understand if he was loading a car or something of the sort and NEEDED to be right there but he wasn't. All I have to say on this is, if he wasn't willing to take 5 seconds out of his day to move, how much care and consideration do they have on a bigger job? I wouldn't trust them.~~#~0
Just picked up our puppy from his first grooming session ever. The people at Pet Smart were very friendly and clearly love dogs. We had Sierra groom our pooch and he got along with her very well. I recommend Sierra if you're looking to clean up your K-9 anytime soon.~~#~1
While the actual bus and driver they sent to take us on our trip was great, working with them was a nightmare. I'd never use them again. They charged my credit card while holding a check for payment and telling me they absolutely would not charge my card on the phone. I didn't find out till a week later when I got my charge card bill and the uncashed returned check. Then nobody would take responsibility as to why it happened and the customer service rep who promised to call me once he found out what happened never did. No attempt to make it right either.~~#~0
DUH. THIS PLACE IS THE BEST.It is so nice not to have to drive to Tempe for my favorite menu. The decor is simple and clean, the staff is adorable and sweet.My favorite items from the menu?1.

Love this place...even better than the Arcadia location!  Great atmosphere, good service, great food and drinks!  Great way to spend a Saturday afternoon hanging out.~~#~1
While visiting friends in Scottsdale (from Seattle, where we are spoiled with good Thai food) we got a craving and our friends suggested Thai House. Everything was so good! I had the lunch special with panang curry. Could have been a little spicier (though I did only order 2 star) but otherwise it was perfect. Will be sure to come back here on my next trip to Phoenix!!!~~#~1
Very friendly owners, fresh high quality produce, including fresh eggs and goat cheese, I highly recommend to try caramel sauce made from goat milk, it is just simply amazing!~~#~1
Fresh ingredients used to make food fast, and always piping hot.  This has been a go-to location for me for years.  It's not your traditional "everything is battered in MSG and fried" kind of Chinese place.  Top items are Kung Pao anything, Pad Thai, and Orange Chicken.Customer service here is also impeccable.  The owner is seemingly always on the premises and is concerned about the quality of your meal.  In fact, I see the same employees year after year, so I imagine he treats them as well as the customers.~~#~1
Never again. I have to go to Avis because they're one of my company's "preferred" vendors, but I'll have to make an exception next time. Service was mediocre. However, when I got to the car to my surprise it was a tiny little Chevy Aveo, which I imagine is an automobile only used for rentals, since no one in their right mind would purchase a vehicle like that. If that wasn't bad enough the car wasn't cleaned; filthy inside and out, the clock in the car was about 7 hours off, there was no power steering, and the navigation system kept on falling apart almost causing me to get in an accident every time I took a turn. I'd recommend any other car rental co over Avis.~~#~0
Post sweat session at the LA Fitness next door, this Trader Joe's just starts calling my name, tempting me to stroll through the aisles and pick up some scrumptious yet healthy treats. I almost always give in, and I never regret my choice.Safeway may have those name brand products that TJ's just hasn't quite replicated yet, but I still enjoy going to TJ's more because of their variety and fresh spin on easy to prepare meals. It's a huge plus that they are so affordable, I never feel ripped off by their prices.Their frozen seafood section is AWESOME! Frozen bags of sea creatures (huge scallops, shrimp, langosta tails) at half the price of Safeway? I'm soooo in! The seasoned frozen ahi tuna & salmon fillets are ridiculously flavorful, juicy and high quality. Their snack section is also so much fun to peruse through. There's always some new dip or chip to try out. And I love how they have a sample station & wine tastings too!My Horse Dog adores their peanut butter dog treats. I highly recommend these for other doggie owners as they are decently nutritious and inexpensive. The bottom line - their employee's are just so friendly and always cognizant of check-out line lengths & open up more registers instantly if lines get to long. Keep up the good work TJ's, you make grocery shopping fun (which is hard to do in my book).~~#~1
I love this place! I lived in Phoenix for 15 years and now that I live in PA, I make sure I visit this restaurant every time I go back. To me, this restaurant shows off exactly what southwest food is capable of. Crappy Americanized Mexican restaurants are a dime a dozen in Arizona (and disaster zones serving microwaved inedible food in PA), but this place offers an innovative, modern take on southern Mexican cuisine. They use fresh, unique, high-quality ingredients.  It's almost an art.I particularly enjoy the enchiladas de hongos, which features wild mushrooms, white truffle oil and a strong goat cheese. The taste is strong and unlike anything I've ever had before. It lingers in my mind (and most likely breath) for days afterward. The drinks feature fresh juices. Really, you shouldn't accept them any other way, in my opinion, but margaritas around me in PA are syrupy concoctions of artificial flavors and sweeteners. Gag.The atmosphere is modern southwest-themed, with bold art on the walls and laid-back, yet attentive servers. I could go just to check out the featured artists.Go! Right now!~~#~1
Just off the 10 freeway in Phoenix, past the Cheech n Chong looking chop-shop, beyond the unsavory, indigent-from-poor-decisions addict looking for a quick fix, ahead of the prison like barbwire engulfing the area, a little further then "Alamo (and yes, probably a bullet hole or many) Beer & Wine" quick shop, rests an unseemly building: Baiz Market. The inside of this establishment is not any better so disregard any hackneyed phrases--"don't judge a book by it's cover"--for now. There is a lite smell reminiscing one of there grandparents cold, dark, musty cellar; and do not expect a warm greeting like the one received from former-convicts at the entrance way of Fry's. The floors match the smell, looking like they have taken a fifty or sixty year beating; and, yes, on the non-perishable items there is some dust. But their ripe produce, tasty deserts, just-chopped meats are definitely worth the trip; also within this repelling at first hub for commodities, sits an eatery to the left from the entrance: Al Hana, the orgasm in your mouth.  Once free of unfavorable feelings, casually walk (nothing to fear, unless you are afraid of rockin' taste) over to the counter of Al Hana's; and order some unforgettable Mediterranian cuisine. We recommend the Shafta or the Shwarma (beef or chicken) with the garlic sauce, wow! Their pitas are made fresh in the "red-brick" (you'll get it later; but you have to try it) oven; their hummus tastes how really Hummus should. Also, try their pies (basically pita pizza)--cheese or meat. Everything we ate--shafta, shwarma, hummus with a grip of pita, 1 large cheese pie, 1 small meat pie, a can of pineapple soda (with really sugar) and a can of grape soda (also not corn syrup)--totaled to only $17.46. True story. So word to the wise, let go, try it, wolf-down a shafta or shwarma pita burrito (for only $4.99 each) because haste does not lack taste. Side note: their saffron is $24 for 4.5g (best deal around here we have seen).~~#~1
Looking for an incredible steakhouse in AZ and not concerned about the damage you'll do to your wallet?  City Hall is the way to go!I've been to City Hall more than a handful of times through the years as well as it's sister concepts: Ocean Club and Mastro's in North Scottsdale.  You cannot go wrong with any of them.  I just happen to prefer City Hall because of the convenient location to where I live and work!I've been to meet a friend or two for happy hour at the bar, I've been for a bachelorette party, and I often go for celebratory date nights with my husband... as we did on this past Wednesday evening to celebrate my birthday!  If you're up for a bit of a scene, some live music and great people watching, I highly recommend sitting in the bar.Let me reiterate: this is a high end steakhouse.  Expect to valet your car and bring cash for the bathroom attendant as well.  But you get what you pay for.  Service is top notch and the food is the best quality I've found in the state and beyond.Starting with drinks, there are plenty to choose from.  I am a dirty martini girl and they make a mean one here.  It's actually two for the price of one, since they bring you the entire shaker and refill it when necessary.  Awesome wine list as well.In addition to the complimentary bread bowl which comes with my favorite pretzel rolls in town, my fave appetizers are their oysters, calamari, and seafood tower if you're with a group.Next up, I am a huge proponent of the Mastro's House Salad.  Tip: it's large, so my recommendation is to share it with someone.  If not, you could easily make a meal of the salad, the bread bowl, and a drink!And for the main course, if you're going with steak, go for the Bone-In Ribeye, and if you're more in the mood for fish, I say Chilean Seabass all the way... you can split either of these also.  Both arrive on Mastro's signature hot plates, and they've always been cooked and seasoned to perfection.  Pair 'em with your favorite sides - you really can't go wrong here although my top picks would be sweet potato fries, creamed spinach, steamed broccoli, and grilled asparagus.  I've never heard anyone complain about the signature lobster mashed potatoes either.By now, you're definitely full, but keep drinking or hanging out digesting until you make room for dessert.  Don't miss the Mastro's Signature Warm Butter Cake.  Thank me later!  You can't go wrong with the Key Lime Pie or Cheesecake either, but again, that butter cake is to die for!On my recent birthday visit, I enjoyed many of the items mentioned above except for the dirty martini and oysters... I'm prego at the moment, so sadly, I had to pass on both.  But after this baby comes, I can't wait to go back for another incredible meal.  Who wants to join me?!~~#~1
One of the best Arizona Sonoran style Mexican food joints in Arizona, or anywhere in the USA!Great thin hot chips with typical, but good Arizona style salsas... My favorite meal on their menu is the #5, Green Chile Chicken tamale, Sour Cream Enchilada, Rice & Beans...The tamale has lots of meat in it, not like most tamales that are 85% Masa and little meat. The green chile they cover the tamale with is absolutely wonderful, very fresh green chile flavor and not to spicy as to mask the flavors of the masa & chicken. The sour cream cheese enchilada is amazing, wait till you taste it, seriously the best Sonoran style enchilada this Chef has ever had....an end product you can only get with using the finest of fresh ingredients!The only downfalls EB has is no hard liquor, which equates to no REAL Margaritas (Ay, caramba!.....but they do have cold beer & and wine) and sometimes theres a wait for a table....buen apittite!!!~~#~1
I'm not a fan of fried burgers, and I gotta say the burger was weak, no flavor to it.  Was as if you bought a package of ground beef, put it in a frying pan at home and didn't season it at all.  Best Burger in Jacksonville they advertise?!?  Thanks, now I know I don't need to ever visit Jacksonville.  Actually, they have signs ALL OVER the place touting themselves . . . ya know, you could take down the signs and let the food speak for itself, but . . . yeah you can't let the burger speak for itself when the burger sucked.  Let's put up more signs!The toppings options were awesome.  I can't see myself going back for a burger, but the toppings might get me in to try a hot dog~~#~0
Review for hotel and properties only - not the restaurant part.I could automatically give 5 stars, as I booked a king size room and ended up in a 1 bedroom casita. But no, there are certainly more aspects. The pools - without a doubt the best pool area in the valley. Very attentive service from skinny ASU kids. Nice grounds, felt a bit like a good European hotel and obviously a good golf course, although I could care less about the old-men-in-triple-pleated-dockers-sport - yawn. Therefore back to the room. Nice, clean and laaaaaarge. Two terraces and two full bathrooms, both with tubs. Full living room and full dining room. Room service was good and to the point.One little negative: please solve the parking problem around the casitas ASAP. Build a separate parking for the people in the triple pleated dockers.~~#~1
The best Real Irish pub in Phoenix.~~#~1
This is the 2nd time i have been here. Once for dinner and this time for lunch.It is absolutely fantastic!!   I have lived by this restaurant for  14 years and just recently discovered it.   Wow,  , Delicious,  tasty and incredibly good.   Even the chips and Salsa are so good.  They brew Coffee for me, which is my most favorite beverage with Mexican Food.    Coffee really enhances the flavor of the spices.I absolutely love this fabulous place. It is spotlessly clean as well and smells really good inside.    Lots of parking in the back of the building. Bathrooms are very clean. Nice and cool inside even though it was 112 degrees outside, yes and it is not even Summer yet.~~#~1
Lovely experience from the phone call to make appointment to the time I left.  Great service!~~#~1
The best meal I've had in a long time. Absolutely spectacular!~~#~1
We had a prom dress disaster 2 days before prom with a black stain on an ivory dress. They were so awesome here! Cleaned it perfectly, ready by the next day & only charged us $5! I highly recommend this place!~~#~1
Still a delightful little South American restaurant! We went back again this year and I got my Peruvian ceviche as I promised myself on last year's spring training trip.  A large pile of citrus cured white fish with celery, red onion boiled yam and potato.  It had a good amount of heat to it, though I couldn't tell what it was coming from.  I got the tamale sampler and it was great.  If I had to choose I'd pick the Ecuadorian tamales hands down.  Hubby ordered a pork empanada, which was really good.  Light, flaky crust, and not thick or oily.  The couple that owns it are really sweet and the wife, who apparently is the head chef, also came out to our table to check on us and thanked us for coming.  Oh, and hubby had the Xangu beer again, the one I couldn't remember from last time.~~#~1
Oh how I wish these were in California!!!I visit my best friend in AZ a couple times a year and everytime I'm there I beg her to take me to Pita Jungle.  I have to say the one in Chandler is my all time the favorite.  The atmosphere is hip, the service is awesome and the outside area backs up to a lake.  It so nice and peaceful to sit outside, watch the ducks and eat their cilantro jalapeno hummus!Everything I've had at this place is delicious.  The gyros are made with just the right amount of tzazkiki sauce, the hummus is smooth and creamy and EVERY flavor is a must try.  I tried the mediterranean chicken salad just this last weekend and my taste buds were in heaven!  So lemo juice, feta and pine nuts took the salad over the top.Now if we could only convince the owners to branch out to California, say Westlake or Thousand Oaks area I bet these would take off.  With all us health food nuts out here we would appreciate the good food!  :)~~#~1
Brak has been a Cardinals season ticket holder since Jiffy Pop Stadium (its real name, ignore that advertisement on the side) opened in '06.  Brak has been to MANY stadiums and arenas all over the country, and you know what?  JPS is truly one of the elite, a world-class venue if ever there was one.  I haven't been to Jerry Jones' new palace in Dallas yet, which is supposed to be the gold standard now, but it would automatically lose 2 stars for that ginormous, 60 yard long drive-in theatre screen hanging over the field.  What the hell was Jerry thinking???!!  I go to the game to watch the game, not be distracted by a monstrosity like that.Parking here and traffic flow are a breeze.  We now manage to get in and out of the Blue lot super-quickly, thanks to strategic parking.  We can stay at the game until the final gun and still fly out of the lot with almost no wait.  And, amazingly, the Blue lot is still free.  Amazing.The Brak-O-Meter actually registers 4.5 stars for JPS (errrr, UOP) stadium, with a half-star deducted for the crummy food, which didn't get ANY better when they canned the old caterer after last year.  But Brak generally rounds up, and the rest of the joint tips the scales in that direction.  One last note - Michael Bidwill, PLEASE open the roof on nice days late in the season.  It's a travesty to sit in there with it shut when it's 70-80 degrees outside.~~#~1
Very surprised but the margarita pizza had absolutely no taste! Not sure if that is normal for that type of pizza but we didn't taste the sauce, the cheese,? And did wait by the door for awhile before someone acknowledged us so didn't like that. We came because we had a Groupon coupon but not if we'll come back when we're used to Grimaldi!!~~#~0
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY TIME OR ENERGY COMING HERE.No.  Seriously.  Stop it.  Don't even think about it.  Okay, if you must, don't do any of the tours.  It's nothing you really can't figure out on your own and at least then it's free.  The triple-tour (the train, the mine tour and funhouse) were $18.  Buying two tours is $16 - so if you want to do all three it sounds like a good deal.  I know nothing about this area.  And I could have given a better tour than these toothless backwards and racist rednecks.1) The train tour - took them about 5 minutes before they acknowledged I even wanted to buy a ticket.  I'm sorry - can you smell my feminist liberalism from NYC?2) the train was cute but was not educational at all.  The guy was kind of an asshole and know it all by not telling you anything at all, then wanted tips.  3) The mine tour was not fun AT ALL.  The tour guide was terrible and an idiot.  My personal favorite was when he started to slam President Obama.  Look, I could give a shit what your political leanings are and you have every right to dislike the president.  But I could give a rat's ass what you think when you voted for Bush twice.  Moving right along, he says "I'll move if he's re-elected."  Good luck in Mexico - you hate Mexicans!  And Canada is far more socially liberal.  Like I said, good luck but I guarantee in 2017, he'll still be there.  If he's still alive.  Asshole.By the way, that's the only thing I retained on that stupid tour.  Not worth time, money or energy.4) The mystery house was kind of cool, I guess, but again, the guy was a real dickweed.  Is there a dickweed gene in Phoenix that has yet to be identified?  Because there is a HUGE sample set, at least in the people I met.5) Everything else was kind of nondescript.If you have a lot of time to kill and you're in Phoenix, trust me...take the extra two hours total in round trip travel and go to Sedona for better pictures, vibes and jeep tours.  Don't do it.  PS I thought a ghost town would be eerier.  I didn't get that feeling at all.  It was kind of hokey and dumb.~~#~0
Chef Payton Curry went "whole hog" on Friday night with a supplemental menu of porky goodness. It was our second visit to Digestif and it was just as good - and fun - as the first.  Upon arrival, we were greeted by Pavle, the smiling host, and the ever-organized and competent Mari from Spaghetti Western. Although the place was quite full, we were given the choice of inside or outside seating. They were filming a segment for a reality show called "Back of the House" so we asked to be seated inside to catch the action. Payton seemed cool as a cucumber, playing to a full house and a film crew. We sat near the mozzarella bar/pizza hearth and soon felt the Digestif Friday night buzz.Not wanting the vibe to get ahead of me, I started my own buzz. I am thrilled with Digestif's eclectic mixology menu full of herbal concoctions, digestifs and absinthe selections (served with an absinthe fountain). I ordered the Pretty Ugli, made with muddled basil and uglifruit liqueur. After one sip, though I loved the basil, the drink was a too sweet for my taste. Our gracious server Amy let me segway to the Segway, a mix of Square One organic cucumber vodka, Hendrick's cucumber and rose petal-infused gin and Lillet, served like a straight-up martini. I loved, loved, loved it. Todd had his fail-safe Mandarin Absolut on the rocks.With our drinks we enjoyed a plate of freshly pulled mozzarella sprinkled with crunchy, chewy bits of sorrel, pork jowl confit and local dates. We also got a perfectly toasted roll, right from the hot hearth - temperature 600+ degrees. Why can't I make toast at home like this? I can't stop thinking about how to get this oven into my house...Then we had the Digestif salad with Maya's arugula, candied hazelnuts, cipollini, blue cheese and balsamic marinated figs. These are a few of my fav-a-rit things.We decided to split the $32 entree - the pork duo - a plate of prosciutto-wrapped chop & loin, braised mustard greens, haricots verts and heirloom carrots. Digestif is know for their freshly-butchered meats and super fresh veggies. They did not disappoint. Ten minutes later I had the bone in both hands and I'm going to town on the last remaining shreds of pig. Luckily our new best friends at the next table were also gnawing on their bones, and we were all talking with our mouths full.Continuing the buzz, we couldn't agree on a bottle of wine so we went with with singles. I especially enjoyed the selection of Santa Ynez wines (we love Sanford).  I had a Pinot Grigio and Todd went with a Pinot Noir.Piggies that we are, we couldn't leave well enough alone and topped off the night with the chunky brownie and chocolate malted semifriddo (semifreddo means 'half frozen', kindof like a gelato) complete with a toasted fresh s'morlicious house-made marshmallow on the side. It was ridiculously good.It's not a meal we'll soon forget, and we'll have to go back about a hundred more times to sample everything on the various and ever-changing menus. Chef Payton seems to have a great pig...er, gig going and we're impressed with his adventurous spirit and love for good food.  I also like that he's not totally full of himself like some chefs we've met.  I agree that it's only a matter of time before he has a Beard award.~~#~1
Chang's Spicy Chicken makes me go...Ding du du du ding ding ...nu nu nuh! Fan-freaking-tastic.I love PF Changs...which we have renamed PF-Twang-Bangers...or PF Chizzle in Scotts-Dizzle.I know how mature right....Best way to go about it...Big huge pot of tea- I like the OOLONG Dragon EyeCalamari with the salt and pepper dip...An order of the Spicy Chicken...bow wow chicka chicka...Brown Rice of course!And an order of MooShoo pork ask him to put half in a box to take home for late night munchie factor...Followed by 2 fortune cookies...always spin them, whatever way the points are pointing thats yours!!Oh yeah and remember after reading your fortune.. you must say "IN BED" loudly after reading it.....makes it better.Rock on Twangs.~~#~1
I love this place, when classes are in session, I'm here like 3-4 times a week. They have delicious pastries and drinks. Plus its by all the sweet vintage shops, a great way to kill a few hours.~~#~1
This is my favorite car wash in the phoenix area. I've gone there about half a dozen times so far, and they always seem to do a good job (much better than the chain carwashes I've been to). It is not the cheapest place, and because it's a hand-wash, it is much slower than most other places. But if you have the time and want to avoid the swirlmarks and other stuff that comes from an automatic wash, this is where to go.~~#~1
Exklusiv also specializes in Audi servicing as well! Took my car to Mark to get some work done on my A4 3.0 Quattro... these guys know their stuff! I will never take my car anywere else!~~#~1
Best Halloween shopping ever. This place has everything and it is all in stock. They have a TON of stuff. The staff is super helpful. I rented a helium tank for 15 bucks that blew up about 50 balloons. The balloons were good quality and inexpensive. A very good deal.~~#~1
This is what locally owned business is all about - in this case, an inspired husband-wife team.You never know what cold micro brews will be available sourced across the globe - from day to day and from hour to hour. A keg finishes, they hook up a new keg and change the chalkboard listing. Always a surprise - a delightful, delicious surprise.And the pub grub - best I've ever had anywhere. Full of surprises from a chef bursting with ideas. Fried egg to top off a flatbread pizza, pecan pie pop tarts, wild game sausage with condiments made in house daily ... perfect complements to the delicious offerings on tap.Downtown might need to be a place to live - people might not want to drive home after sampling the riches on the streets down here!~~#~1
After our week in Page, we spent a few nights in Sun City with my Mom and Grandma. Since we were there in summer (which is a rarity for me) I was able to talk Grandma into going somewhere besides the Elephant Bar and a place without having a coupon! As luck would have it, she suggested Skye saying it was a wonderful place and she knew we would enjoy it as an early birthday celebration for my husband. Man oh man was this a great restaurant. Actually it seems like it is half restaurant, half night club and with our 5:30 reservation (yes, this was a "late" dinner for my Grandma), we of course only spent time in the actual restaurant. We were a party of 6 and 4 of us had a cocktail to start. My cosmo was one of the "specials" and was nice and strong for only $6.00. It was the most creative cosmo I have had as it came with a little dry ice in it. Grandma was very happy with her martini and well, no one said much as we drank and perused the menu whilst nibbling on a really good and creative bread basket. My husband and I shared mostly everything and others on the table traded bites. We started with both the Caesar salad and lobster bisque. I was highly impressed with both. The Caesar had homemade croutons and dressing and were very tasty and the lobster bisque was heavenly-not too rich and full of real lobster (even in Arizona!). My daughter had a specialty salad with Gorgonzola and strawberries and loved every morsel. Since I don't eat stinky cheese, I cannot attest to the taste but she keeps talking about the salad. For our entree, Kevin and I shared a bone-in ribeye. This was what 3 of the six(4 if you count me) ordered. My mom had the fish special which was melt in your mouth to die for and my daughter had the filet. The sides are huge and are meant for sharing (like Fleming's or Ruth Chris), so 5 of us shared baked potatoes and mushrooms while the last of our party had the twice baked that no one else got to taste (must have been good).Our steak was incredible and rivals with my memories of Durant's. I savored every cholesterol increasing bite. My Grandma enjoyed hers so much she looked over to me and thanked me for insisting we go somewhere different.Unbeknownst to me, 2 desserts were brought out with candles to celebrate the upcoming birthday of my husband and other part of our party. The desserts were delicious and beautifully presented and since they were "on the house", my Grandma was pleased. I am coming back to the Phoenix area at the end of the month for a couple of nights and am already angling for a reason to come back to Skye...I loved it, I really loved it!~~#~1
My husband and I stopped in for happy hour on a Friday. The atmosphere is chill, the ambiance is classy, and the piano-playing topped off the great atmosphere. We sat at the bar. The bartender was great...very attentive. Their happy hour menu is fabulous - many happy hour menus have cheap wine that tastes like dirty socks...not this place...their wine was good.We stuck with happy hour food and did not order dinner, so I cannot review their food, but if you're looking for an upscale yet highly affordable happy hour, this is a great spot.~~#~1
Wow, what happened?  The place was great the first time around.  The upkeep is horrible.  My booth had a bad stench.  You know, that dirty rag smell.  The sushi is such low quality.  The food didn't look fresh at all.  I didn't even want to try the ice cream.  It was so messy.  I don't think I'll be coming back here again.~~#~0
Favorite place for pancakes~~#~1
The best baby store ever!  I wish had been around when my older kids were babies.  I have been able to benefit from it some with my third, although it opened when she was close to one.Why is it so much better than the others?  SERVICE and SELECTION!They sell regular brands in basic areas like diapers, toys, etc. but they also sell good quality organic items like linens, creams, sunscreens, all brands of strollers and even some high end and boutique items like Kate Spade diaper bags!  Where else can you get all this in one place?  Did I mention the stroller selection is amazing!Their prices are in line with everyone else's but they are made more inticing by the numerous coupons they send once you are on their mailing list.  They'll even take Bed Bath and Beyond coupons (their parent company)!  Not gonna find 20% off baby stuff very often.The last time I went in the store, I was asked by around 5 people if they could help me find anything.  The cashier even helped me maximize the coupons I was using (some were 20% off and some were $5 off $15).  Then she offered to help me wrap a gift item I purchased.  Talk about service!  You sure don't get this kind of attention at Toys R Us!~~#~1
"My Big Fat Greek Restaurant" just started serving breakfast. I love breakfast. I love food. And now I love MBFGR. Patti and I went this morning and it was great. You know, it's normal breakfast fare, but with a greek influence, the ambiance (at Shea and Tatum anyway), the presentation (nice table settings and side items, described below) and the great preparation, it was a step above our usual destinations.I had the obligatory gyro omelet, with an included side of pancakes (one of a couple of options). Included as a surprise on the plate was a mini-muffin and a fresh fruit bowl (small, but just perfect). The pancakes were dusted with powdered sugar and, somewhere in or under the cakes was a little bit of cinnamon-flavored applesauce (maybe an unwelcomed surprise to some, but it was great). The fried country potatoes with onions and such were fresh and hot and complimented the perfectly-cooked omelet stuffed with good gyro meat and feta.All that on the square, greek-themed plates made for a breakfast feast. I hope their upcoming advertising will bring in enough business to continue their breakfast offerings as a supplement to the regular dining hours, one of which we occupied the other night with a gyro salad and baba ghanoush that was equally great. Opa! Try to make it!~~#~1
Good food great service, Tip is the best cook~~#~1
I have been going to Dilly's for years and it  never disappoints me. Always order the same thing, half a sandwich and soup deal. I recommend the Dilly Bird and the cream of broccoli bread bowl. Service is okay...as it's usually made up of college kids but the food more than makes up for it.~~#~1
By far the best subs!!!  These subs are not for the faint hearted. Their giant is just that!!  Get it mikes way & don't forget the bacon... They are a good service restaurant,  always happy & friendly.~~#~1
I recently stayed here on a military trip to Luke afb.  The room was huge and very comfortable, the staff was superb and the facilities are top notch.  I will definitely come here again.  The only complaint is that the bartender was from New York and a Yankee fan.   Being from boston originally, the wigwam should make her change to a Red Sox fan.~~#~1
Dr. Jerry Sobel is an exceptional physician, he is very caring and communicates about complicated medical procedures with patients in a respectful and helpful way. He is always direct with his patients, and he is completely devoted to resolving your medical issues. He was very concerned about my long term prognosis and did not just throw pills at me. I appreciated that he really listened to me, and he regards all his patients with chronic pain, back pain, etc as people, not just a random patient to get in and out of he office as fast as possible. Dr. J.Sobel is a physiatrist - I had no idea what that was until I needed one! He specializes in treatment and rehabilitation of disorders of the muscle, nerves, and joints. He is a board certified Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation doctor. D. Jerry Sobel always returns my calls in a timely manner, he is always more than willing to answer questions regarding medications etc. He has also always worked me in for same day appointments, which I appreciate in a busy practice like his. He cares about the whole health of his patients and recommend all kinds of information on healthy living, diet, exercise, back exercises, and will provide all sorts of helpful tips and ideas. He even gave me a recipe! Super friendly staff and excellent PAs. I was very happy with the level of care.~~#~1
I ordered the eggs rancheros. The tortillas were home made but not properly cooked as they were doughy and really thick. My friend had the chicken quesadilla. The chicken was hard as a rock due to being over cooked. The only thing that was good were our mimosas. Do not recommend this place.~~#~0
Went here to try the place out. Lets just say I will not only never be back but I will be telling the world to avoid this place. We waited for 45mins to be seated. As I stood there and waited, I watched the manager seat all of her friends who came in well after us. If your Jewish, you will probably love this place because its very apparent you get preferential seating. I finally went and asked why we haven't been seated yet and there were about 8 people AFTER me on the list who were already eating.After we got seated the waitress seemed in a horrible mood and made a bad experience even worse. The food wasnt horrible but also not good. The people who work here seemed so confused and clueless on how to run a restaurant. My advice: Go to Mcdonalds and get better service. Also they wont penalize you if your name isn't goldman.~~#~0
Thoroughly enjoyed the Skirt Steak plus the dessert of the day, a chocolate pudding with a cakey covering was delightful. Cant wait to go back!~~#~1
The two words I would use to describe the food at True Food Kitchen would be FRESH and FLAVORFUL! I probably will never be able to enjoy a vegetable from Safeway again after the amazing produce from True Food! I don't even especially like veggies and the crudite plate was amazing.  I could go on and on about every dish, dessert, and drink that we ordered.  The staff was incredibly accommodating and knowledgeable.  The ambiance, service, and food make it a great place for a fun lunch with girl friends or a lunch meeting.~~#~1
USAirways?  I don't think so scooter!  They don't even deserve to have US in their name, because first of all, it's not about US, it's about THEM.  Secondly, they are a disgrace and an embarassment to this country.  Where should I start?  I was going a mere 650 air (900 land) miles to Durango, CO from San Diego, CA with a connecting flight in Phoenix.  After boarding the plane, they inform us there is a machanical problem with the auxillary power unit (a common problem on the old POS Airbus planes!!), and they would have to manually start the engines on the ground.  Not sure what this meant, I was nervous and frantically googling on my iphone to make sure the plane was safe to fly without it.  Fortunately, it was, but unfortunately for all of us low passengers waiting to take off, we had no air circulation in the cabin until after the plane took off because that's one of the many things the APU does for the plane.Bump, crunch, grind, bump, crunch grind... Those were the sounds the plane was making while they fired up the engines.  I seriously thought I was going to die!  Then, once the engines got fired up, the plane was making a wierd clicking sound as we taxied on the runway, and even as we were taking off.  This really made me nervous.  Everyone was joking that the clicking was the sound of them manually winding the crank up so the plane could take off.  I gotta give props to the pilot, he made up for the delays and got us into Phoenix on time, but the flight crew was just eh, not too friendly, they all kinda looked like they hated their jobs.  Everything costs money on this airline, it's $2 bucks for water or a soda, $7 bucks for a beer or a cocktail.  $5 if you want an aisle or window seat, or else they smack you in the middle seat.  By the way, that "choice seat" fee is per connection, so if you want an aisle seat on all of your flights (say you have 3 connections) that's $15, not $5.  Then I paid $15 to check my bag.  So, all total, my $330 round trip to fly 650 miles ended up costing me $380, but that's not all!  If you act now, you'll also have your return flight to San Diego cancelled in Phoenix!Yes folks, they cancelled all flights out of Phoenix to San Diego at 9pm last night because there was fog at the airport in San Diego.  The worst part is that they made us wait for 2 hours before telling us our flight was cancelled.  I could have been half way to San Diego by car.  Then, everyone was asking if they can't just fly to Orange County or LAX (Which we heard from other people in the airport did not have any fog) and they abruptly told us no.  So, what happens when your US Airways flight gets cancelled?  Nothing!  You get to sleep at the airport all night long, and then beg, pleed and pray that they can find you a flight out in the morning.  They don't put you up in a hotel, they merely offer you a "discounted negotiated rate at a local hotel".   They didn't offer to compensate.  They didn't communicate to us what would happen to our bags.    I heard from another guy who talked to the lady at the counter that they told him there were no flights available until tomorrow night, which means I would have been flying back to San Diego on New Years eve, assuming they didn't get fogged in.So, what did I do?  I rented a car at Hertz, total cost was $127.50 (OUCH one way rentals are expensive) but I decided if I'm going to be driving to San Diego at 10pm at night I better have a comfy car, so I upgraded to the CTS for $20 more which was well worth it in the grand scheme of things, I made record time and was home in bed by 3am on 1 tank of gas (and people diss American cars but I'm here to tell ya, 300 horsepower, 1 tank of gas, 380 miles, AMAZING!)...  Now I'm waiting to hear about my bags, desperate and afraid of how long it might take.  I'm also hoping they will refund me for my flight, but I doubt that's going to happen.  Will update the review after I see how they treat me after the fact.Needless to say, I know flight cancellations in San Diego are rare, but I just don't think I can trust my life with this airline ever again with their old worn out planes, nickel and diming you to death with fees, and hey, wait a second, isn't gas lower then it's been in 10 years and yet the airlines are still charging us all these fees and higher fares?!~~#~0
Thank GOODNESS they finally started a HH!  It was getting insane to pay $18/martini - esp. in a group - and we were always paying!This is the BEST little bar to start - or end - an perfect eve.  Want a fantastic & romantic sunset? Presto!  This is it.  Talk about "impress your passenger" with the amzaing drive up - they will wonder what you are "UP" to.  Valet is there in an instant to meet your needs.  I like walking down the steps, but instead of walking straight in, I detour to the right, which offers the pristine views.  You also can provide the option of "shall we sit out here, or in?"The place is really small & intimate - in and out - so be prepared for that, as it can be quite popular.I will absolutly be back - again.~~#~1
We have never had a bad thing to eat here.  Oh, I take that back. Over the years, things can't be perfect but on that rare occasion that something wasn't right or didn't live up to our expectation, apologies were made and the issue corrected.   Tonight, I had the pastrami sliders and a caesar salad..  the pastrami was fjantastic, not at all fatty. I was served 4 sandwiches which was a surprise based on the price and past experiences. I had only expected 3.  Glad we stopped in again and I know we'll be back again.~~#~1
I saw Stephanie tonight at the Yelp Elite Beauty Bash at Benefit Cosmetics in Santa Monica.I don't know if she was speaking to my spirit guides or if her spirit guides were able to tell her all those things about me but I couldn't believe how dead on she was with my reading.  She was truly amazing.There have been some important decisions in my life that I've been struggling with and she gave me the clarity I needed.Thank you so much, Stephanie!~~#~1
Great meal great service. Wife and I came here tonight for our anniversary and had a great experience. Even the music was perfect.~~#~1
Walked in tonight with eight people four being children.  Place was packed yet Tommy seated us immediately. Normally this is a self service spot. Tommy took our order and served us amidst the hustle of the place. Great service.  Right on!  Gelato was great too!  Love the coconut!~~#~1
Now this is one fancy treat! I went to this mcdonalds late saturday night and almost blew out my britches from the terrible burger king the night before when I realized how good the golden arche's prices treat ya! With the cost of gas more than your neighbors flapjack its hard to imagine how they cram all that chicken in each nuggy and keep it only a dollar to add on to ANY combo meal. 5 stars!~~#~1
Friendly staff, cozy atmosphere, good food.  I have no complaints about this location or with The Keg as a chain in general.  More importantly, my wife has no complaints either which is very rare.I wouldn't say the food or service here is of Mastro's, Ruth's Chris or Capital Grille quality but its the next best thing.If you haven't already I suggest signing up for their birthday club thing.  They will email you a certificate good for a free meal to use during the month of your birthday.  It will say you can use it for a steak but you can get the cash value ($23 or something) to use for whatever you want.  Last night my wife and I sat in the bar area to take advantage of the happy hour drinks and those awesome potato chips.  The happy hour drink specials for beer and wine are pretty decent but the orange martini thing is way too sweet.  They should just have a regular martini.Anyway, I had a burger and my wife had a salad with grilled shrimp.  My burger was perfectly cooked and had excellent flavor.  My wife's salad was very tasty as well and contained 6 or 7 nice size shrimp.  For a side we shared an order of the roasted beets which were fantastic.The only downside of this place is that it is located in Desert Ridge.  I hate that place with a passion.  It is always so crowded and the layout of the place just sucks.  Just getting in and out of the parking lot can be a clusterfuk.  Whoever designed this place is an idiot.~~#~1
worst tuna sandwich i've ever had.... and i use "tuna sandwich" loosely, in that i had to check to make sure there was actually tuna in the damn thing.  i don't eat at subway often, but when i do, i order the same thing; tuna on italian with the works.  and theirs SUCKED.  i'll never step foot in this subway location again.  who wants to pay 5 dollars for stale bread and a shit ton of lettuce?~~#~0
If you come here to eat breakfast because an old friend is in town for the day, here's some advice; DON'T.Service doesn't even aspire toward bad. In fact, the service ranks so far down on the bad scale, it can't be measured. I't like that movie...The Abyss.Food was decent, but nothing to make your shorts wet.And you know those dollar sign symbols indicating how pricey the joint? Well this place should have a small picture of Warren Buffet, Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerberg gathered inside  the bullion room at Fort Knox for some kind of ceremonial "Were rich, bitches'  circle jerk, prominently displayed somewhere on the menu.This place not only sucks balls, it does so with such tremendous wind tunnel force, it swooshes them down whole, where they lodge in the back of your throat, jamming up your glottal stop, preventing you from making the UH-OH sound upon seeing your bill.~~#~0
The weather is warmer so Froyo is on my mind a lot lately so we decided to visit Golden Spoon and they did not disappoint; well maybe a little cause they were out of Banana. The lady in front of me in line got the last of it, WTH was I gonna choose now. So I asked for a taste of Chocolate and the Peanut butter and they were yummy so I mixed them with Heath Bar Bits and Almonds. It was so good, I will have to choose that combo again.  This place is not self serve and during my visit there was only one counter person and she was busy, but she was nice and efficient. I think Golden Spoon is my favorite Valley Froyo spot the taste can't be beat.~~#~1
Great prices on all the 6 pack veggies! Always nice plants and friendly people.~~#~1
I recently stopped here for an eye exam and new glasses per the recommendation of a coworker (he said Target, not this one specifically). This location was close to my home and has hours until 8pm. The doctor I had was extremely friendsly and performed the eye exam well. He was honest in what my choices were and what it meant for the future. I ordered two pair of classes and was told to expect 7-14 business days. My visit was on a Wednesday and I was surprised when they called me the following Tuesday to say they arrived. The fit was good and the price reasonable. Not only was the doctor friendly and knowledgable, but the staff was also. With hours until 8pm I will definitely come back here in the future.~~#~1
I somehow randomly drove past this place after attending a race event at Firebird and decided to give it a go. I was totally blown away! The food was made even more delicious by the luck of running across such a wonderful place. The decor is great, the open-ness of the room makes for a comfortable dining experience and the colors are vibrant without being too busy. The artwork was fun to look at while we waited for our food to arrive.I ordered pad se ew with chicken (my mainstay Thai dish) and had wild berry tea as a beverage. The tea was amazing, with fresh berries added which gave it a natural flavor as well as a lovely snack once I was finished with the drink. My husband ordered drunken noodle, Thai spicy and it was definitely just that. My pad se ew was cooked perfectly. The noodles looked like they were made in-house and the black soy sauce was a perfect mix of salty with a bit of sweetness. The broccoli and chicken were all cooked perfectly and there was a nice balance of all three ingredients. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about Thai food and gave very good recommendations. If I even find myself in the Phoenix area again I will definitely be making a return visit.~~#~1
My family and I have been regular patrons of this restaurant since before yelp even existed!! The owner, Hiro-san, is the friendliest man ever :)  When I was a little girl he would used to carve me flowers and animals out of carrots in his spare time to keep a bored kid in an adult's dinner party happy and occupied. Now that the restaurant's so successful he has barely any time to make it in and out of the kitchen! But he never fails gives us a huge grin and welcoming wave whenever he sees us.  The staff here is so friendly that when I walk in the doors I always feel at ease.  It's the same feeling as returning home to food and an experience that I KNOW is going to be amazing and satisfying.Now on to the food...my family and I come to this restaurant AT LEAST once every month.  Since this place is a must-go whenever we have guests visiting, and we've had numerous guests visit us this past month, we have been to HIro's once every week!  Even with all the frequent dining at this restaurant for so many years, we're never tired of it because it is JUST THAT GOOD.  The food is authentic (as I already knew but again confirmed by my visiting friends from Japan) and the quality very fresh.  The following is a list of our favorites:- miso soup- no explanation necessary :)- spicy tuna roll- catepillar roll- ADORABLE looking and everyone whose had it swears it's delicious.  I believe them but I don't eat eel so I've never tried it.- toro- excellent quality!!- hiyayakko- cold tofu with bonito flakes paired with scallions and ginger.  Pour some soy sauce over it and you have a light, healthy, but tasty appetizer.- nasumiso- miso glazed eggplants. You can't go wrong with this one, trust me.- hamachi kama- yellowtail collar.  The meat is so tender and the sauce they have with it totally makes the dish.  Be sure to squeeze some lemon on it as well!- dynamite- a seafood mix baked in a special sauce.  This is a dish you won't see elsewhere.  It's very rich but also very unique.- halibut carpaccio- raw sliced halibut with sliced scallions and tomatoes.  They pour hot oil over it to half-cook it.  Kind of Italian-Japanese fusion, and very creative!- zaru soba- authentic Japanese soba noodles. Refreshing and perfect for a hot summer day.- green tea ice cream- if you're feeling up to desert, definitely give this a try.  Green tea is my personal favorite and it's actually hard to find good quality ice cream in that flavor!  Their GT ice cream is definitely NOT the cheap gross ones I've unfortunately purchased once at a supermarket...That should be enough to get you started! There are so many more great dishes I could list but these are the ones we always come back to :)  Branch out and give everything a try! This would be the place to try new things because you can be at ease knowing that anything you order will be of a certain caliber. We tried the sesame roll for the first time yesterday and it was surprising, creative, and delicious.  :)Hopefully my super long, and way overdue review of this restaurant will convince you to go try it out, or even just try some new dishes!  Now go make your reservation...I promise you won't be disappointed!!~~#~1
great sushi available until 10pm nightly.their sushi happy hour is great with $3 wells and $5-6 delicious rolls. their crunch roll is exceptional.i have not tried the 24 hour restaurant but i've heard good things!~~#~1
Why update a review if the star rating can't get better?  Cuz I still can't get over the wagyu corned beef....~~#~1
I have never had an unpleasant experience here. Ive sat in multiple areas of the restaurant.... the upstairs being my favorite. I love the dim lighting and contrast in soft/rough architecture. Incredible seasonal food. WONDERFUL service. I once stayed pass closing time without realizing it and I was never rushed or given attitude nor was it brought to my attention by the staff. Thank you St Francis. You were above my expectations.~~#~1
I always have a great experience at The Facial Studio. Not only does Rochelle do amazing facials, but she also gave me alot of education about my skin.  Now I know what do to for my skin & it's never looked better.~~#~1
My van's stock DVD player busted & I was not about to drive around with kids in the back and no videos.  This would surely lead to road rage some day.My next problem... I'm in grad school and I don't have time to give up my van too long and I certainly don't have time to make return visits to fix any bugs.  However, anytime you buy after-market car audio/video there is a risk that it may not work perfectly because these are often custom installs.  These are NOT do-it-yourself projects.The DVD unit we installed worked well but it lacked a feature that we assumed it offered.  I did not have time to return immediately to replace it.  I spoke with Dave and we agreed to do some research to find the right product for my needs.  Because I was busy with school & life I didn't follow up for about 2 months.  Once I got a chance to return to the shop I was worried that they would try to blow me off because of the time that had passed.  Surprisingly, they didn't even hesitate to makes things right.In my younger days I dealt with many car stereo places and they often turned out to be very shady.  This place is legit.  They never jerked me around.  That might be why they have been in business for so long.~~#~1
This little cafe is like a hidden gem. Everything here is out of this world yummy! I got the chicken pesto wrap (sandwich in a wrap) and a side of the pesto pasta salad and it was so delicious. I've also had the club sandwich and that was good too. I'm definitely a fan. Just wished it was open longer hours.~~#~1
Don't make the same mistake that I did and wait to try this place during your last month in town. In between my gym membership and leaving, I wanted to make sure I was still getting a work out in and found that Sutra does "tastings" where you can sign up for as short as two weeks for $25.The Skullpt classes are a great work out- they mix pilates, dance and yoga moves. So far I've taken classes with both Chelsea and Meghann and would highly recommend both of them as instructors. They are great at pushing you, and also providing the proper positive reinforcement one needs when you feel like your body is going to fail on you.The actual studio is gorgeous, clean and has little storage cubbies for all your stuff. I'm honestly sad that I lived this close to this studio and didn't look into it sooner- don't make the same mistake that I did!~~#~1
This place is AMAZING!  I always take my family and friends here when they visit.  The shaved ice is really soft and fluffy and is even better with cream.  There are somewhere around 50 flavors to try, so you won't ever get bored.  They have a drive thru that's open pretty late so you can come here for a midnight snack whenever you want.  The staff is friendly and courteous and they all seem to be happy to work there.~~#~1
I had left a previous negative review but I got carry-out tonight.  There is no denying their pizza is excellent.  Everyone seemed so much more upbeat and friendly so I changed the negative to positive-welcome to the neighborhood!~~#~1
We just moved to Scottsdale, AZ from California and had not yet found a good sushi place.  I am so happy to have found a great sushi place at Toyama.  It is a local little restaurant here in town and it is wonderful to have such a delicious place to have my favorites.  We met Mo and he is great, we really enjoyed chatting with him.  I loved the Nigiri portions... Big on fish and light on the rice.  Just perfect.  I had the salmon, yellow tail, clam, and eel nigiri.  So so so good.  My husband had Katsu and Gyoza and loved it.  If you are looking for authentic Japanese this is the place to go.  We will be returning again and again and again.  When we were ready to leave another couple came in and Mo told us they had been coming into Toyama's for sushi for 10 years.  I love places like this... They have roots in the community and it is clear they take great pride in their food and service.~~#~1
These guys are the best. A breath of fresh air in the world of corporate-run auto repair rip off artists. They know what they are doing and do it at a reasonable price.~~#~1
Just the right amount of crusty-but-soft, warm, fresh bagels to be found in the Valley!  Very friendly, prompt service.  This will be our only stop if we want a REAL bagel!!~~#~1
Oregano's has upbeat and attentive young servers - servers who actually seem happy to be there!  This always is a plus in dining out.Our delicious thin crust pizza with sundried tomatoes, pepperoni, mushrooms, (your choice of toppings) was one of the best I've had in the valley.  I loved the chicken Caesar salad which was superior to most -  it was topped with pulled chicken, shaved parmesan slices and a tangy Caesar dressing.Oregano's is a comfy upbeat restaurant with great service and great food - an excellent time was had by all!~~#~1
I don't usually like writing reviews for big national chains but I had to write a nice review about this place after our experience.  I've been to CPK's many times and never had a pizza I didn't like.  This time I ordered the chicken pesto and LOVED it.  I also love pizza places that offer whole wheat and thin crust.  The crust was awesome and the pizza was probably my favorite out of all the pizzas I've had there.One of our pizzas got burnt so our pizzas were taking forever and I needed to get back to work.  The waitress came over an apologized several times.  When she came with the pizzas she told us that the pizzas were on the house because they took so long.  This was not expected as most places in my scottsdale area would just say "Sorry, deal with it."  The perks of going to a big chain I guess?  The manager also came over and apologized.  This was very generous of them.  I love you even more CPK, even if you are a chain.~~#~1
Alcoholic ice cream with all kinds of varieties. They're friendly and generous with samples too!~~#~1
Excellent menu with just enough items to feel like you have options without being overwhelmed.  Super helpful staff, excellent service, amazing food.  Plus you can sit by the duck pond while you dine!~~#~1
Sprinkles cupcakes is nothing special and it just goes to show marketing is everything. The service is great and the presentation of the cupcakes is nice. When you see the pretty cupcakes in their nice box you really think you are getting a gourmet cupcake like other bakeries. The red velvet cupcake was Just ok. The Carmel apple and cinnamon sugar cupcakes were muffins. They were good but I was expecting a cupcake. The chocolate vanilla with sprinkles was the best but nothing to write home about. There are tons of great bakeries out there with amazing cupcakes. I will never come back here and I hope one day more people see past all the gimics and realize sprinkles is just a fancy store selling over priced regular old cupcakes and muffins.~~#~0
I literally cannot find fault with this place. As you walk in, they've got these super long booths that invite and encourage big groups, tall ornamental candles with long trails of wax that occasional reach down to the table, and just the right dimness to evoke an intimate atmosphere without necessitating a flashlight to read the menu. The pasties are all incredible. My one regret about this place is that I wish I could try every single one, but there are something like 30 to choose from, and it alway stakes me an inordinate amount of time to choose. They have thoroughly mastered the art of incorporating just about any cuisine into that delectable pasty crust. You like straight up Irish style? They got it. You want steak? They have that. Are you a fan of Indian food?! Yes, they have one of those. How about a cheeseburger pasty? YES. Each variation is so tempting, I've actually found myself considering their vegetarian options, and I'm about as vehemently anti-vegetarian as they come. So, yeah, the food's good.Beer-wise, I love this place. Love. It. First, you get to pick what size beer you want (16, 20, or 32 oz, or pint, imperial pint, and stein). Then, pick from their draft selection. Yes, it's not a very wide selection, but look what you're getting: Boddington's, Guinness, Rogue Hazelnut Brown, DOGFISH HEAD 90 MINUTE(!!!). You simply cannot leave here unsatisfied. And if that wasn't enough, during happy hour Irish Car Bombs are only $3. I believe a better deal simply doesn't exist in Tempe. Do yourself a favor and eat here as soon as possible.~~#~1
Seriously the best ice cream/gelato I have ever had. I like ice cream, frozen yogurt, gelato A LOT. I have tried a ton of places but Frost is the most amazing frozen treat I have ever had. I would give 10 stars if I could. Not to mention the staff is SUPER FRIENDLY and extremely knowledgable. You can try as many samples as you want - and I have. Oh and its low calorie!!! Wahoo! I frequent Brio next door often for date night, but never get their deserts any more - we always head to Frost.~~#~1
Korina A, you're out of your ever loving mind lol.I used to agonize before getting a hair cut. I'd worry endlessly that I'd get a bad cut. Maybe I just won't like it. Maybe the stylist won't listen to me or understand what I'm asking for. Maybe this, maybe that... while I gnaw my nails away with anxiety.Then I came here. I leave feeling sexy & great. My hair has been transformed from it's outgrown shaggy state to sleek, fresh, fun, flirty, bouncy, & cute. All for $13! And don't forget to tip!There are people who only come to see Angie. I love her. But I also like this very tall African American woman who's name I can't recall. She cut my hair last time & did a phenomenal job. I'm prone to flyaways & my hair is fine. She worked my hair just right to help me hide my flyaways & give my hair volume.So yes, I still worry about my hair. But it's not as bad as it used to be. I'm comfortable knowing I'll leave feeling & looking better.I sure as heck won't pay $30+ for a salon cut. Only time I've done that was the only time my fears were completely founded. My hair SUCKED.Great Clips, I'm a loyal customer :)Thank you!~~#~1
When I arrived I already had an idea of what I wanted. The man that greeted me at the counter was very professional and polite. He handed me a menu and asked what I would like. I explained that I wanted the mongolian beef. As I was ordering I looked back into the kitchen and it appeared to be very clean. This menu item comes with a bowl of white rice. He asked if I would like a drink as well. Usual service, but done very professionally. I received my food quickly and it was very tasty! The portion sizes are generous and filling. While I was enjoying my meal another patron entered the restaurant and made a large order. When the order was completed the restaurant staff proceded with her food out the front door to load it for her. I was shocked that they didn't offer to do it and just did it! That is great customer service!!I must say I was very impressed not only with the food but the customer service as well. I believe they also have good business practices in place by using paper cups and styrofoam plates. I will definitely go back! Thanks Yan's!~~#~1
I wish there was less than 1 star because now that they don't have flour chips there is no point..... It is just another Mexican restaurant :-( Super bummer.~~#~0
Roka Akor is amazing.  The sashimi is fresh and perfectly cut.  The desserts are also perfection.Blue fin tuna flight was their special tonight and it was so delicious that I took a moment to close my eyes and indulge in the moment of the melting fresh fish in my mouth.  The rice hotpots are always good - I've had the mushroom rice hotpot with mountain vegetables and one with crab, both were delicious.  I've had steak both times I've been there and while it was very good, the sashimi, rice hotpot, and desserts are must haves.~~#~1
20 mins to get service and then another 30 waiting for drinks. Went to the bar to find out what was going on. They finally told us they were looking for the alcohol that goes in the drinks...BS!! Avoid this place like the plague!!!~~#~0
Went to House of Tricks to celebrate the following, as the following occur on weekdays for us in 2012, and the weekend is the best time for us:My Birthday on 9 AprilOur Marriage Day on 12 AprilMy wife and I celebrated both, and this was a wonderful place.  My wife got ahi tuna with a Southwest & Asian flareI ordered lamb shank with a French/Italian flareBoth were very good.  We also had a wonderful quail for our starters.  This is definitely worth it in the Mill Avenue District~~#~1
I wanted to buy the groupon for this place, so I read the reviews (despite seeing the 2 stars on yelp). Clearly, I am not goin to either buy the groupon now or ever plan to go this place. It seems the management neither cares about the reviews here nor does anything to change that. Plus it pains me to see the correlation between the prices of the items here, the quality of food/ambiance offered & the ratings on yelp. I am sorry I am reviewing this place before actually going here, but thank you yelp for the warning. Not changing this until I see an improvement though~~#~0
I don't give out 5 star reviews very easily, but when I go somewhere multiple times and it is always consistent, I think it is deserving.Ling & Louie's is best described as Asian fusion, I mean there is meatloaf on the menu for goodness sakes!  But they do an excellent job modernizing some of the classics, and it is never greasy!  The orange chicken and crispy spinach is divine, the walnut shrimp so tasty, and I love the fact that they use filet for the beef in all their dishes!  It is always cooked so perfectly and the meat is so tender it just melts in your mouth!They do a great job on appetizers too, potstickers, sushi and the soups are all excellent, especially the chicken and rice, it has just a hint of spice.Their drink menu has lots of fun and fruity drinks too, but if you are looking for something nonalcoholic, try the fresh squeezed limeade....it is soooo good!~~#~1
Loved the tour! This place was really nice with 2 levels full of Italian artwork covering the walls made the atmosphere warm, fun, and inviting.  Like your grandmother's living room! Everything about the restaurant is "large." Huge portion sizes made it perfect for sharing and separate private rooms made it cozy for large families enjoying a night out. Our service was awesome as it was my friend's birthday they brought an oversized birthday card signed by the staff and gave her a special happy birthday song rendition. I enjoyed the Spicy Chicken Rigatoni and the Cheesy Bread Florentine, while the others had Baked Rigatoni; there were no complaints and plenty in our to-go boxes!~~#~1
This laundromat is really nice. Its a little pricey. The single load is 75 double 1.75 and 50 cents to dry for 13 min. Its really clean and spacious and you can even get you laundry done for you for 89 cents per lb. Not bad at all~~#~1
I can't really say anything that has not already been said. This place is fun, funky, and delicious. My go to sandwich is the Croque Madame. The egg on top is always cooked perfectly and its a big sandwich for your $$ ! I have yet to order here and NOT get a desert ( I can't help myself!!).... you really can't go wrong. I love all the cookies but the last few times I have been sucked in by the cupcakes..... banana bread cupcake with toasted coconut frosting... DONE! So moist and the frosting was killer ( but there is a lot of it) I love all the quirky gifts you can buy in here, and a lot of it is by local artists! I always get all my stocking stuffers here! My most recent purchase was a LGO hot/cold cup .... so much cooler than the Starbucks ones :) Love everything about this place! I really do... its my favorite place to stop after a hike up Camelback! ... really its just my favorite place to stop period. :)~~#~1
We've been to Zinburger numerous times and I thought I'd update my review.  I absolutely love their Kobe burger but finally forced myself to try something different.  One particular week,  I had my fair share of beef so I decided to try their turkey burger.  It wasn't the usual one on the menu but was a Thanksgiving special.  This burger was exactly the Thanksgiving turkey burger you would imagine - moist turkey burger, cranberry sauce, and stuffing - fantastic.  I was so disappointed they only serve it around Thanksgiving.  After delighting in my usual Kobe burger again for a while, I tried their regular turkey burger and it, too, is tasty (especially with mushrooms).  But the burger with the stuffing and cranberry sauce is something I'm going to indulge in again next Thanksgiving and, being a foodie, I can't wait.~~#~1
This is the best and most authentic Japanese food in AZ.  Toh Zan serves up the tastiest original Japanese food that I've ever tasted, even in comparison to LA's Japantown.  The restaurant is a bit small and the owner might seems standoff-ish but they are polite and nice people.I don't like to be waited on hands on foot so this actually fits my lifestyle.In the summer months, you should try their cold noodle, especially Ten Zaru (cold noodle with shrimp & veggies tempura).  My wife really like their Chicken Katsudon.  The meals generally comes with some sides (salad, miso soup, etc) and in generous portion.  The food is never oily and taste fresh.  Give this place a try and you will not be dissapointed.~~#~1
Pretty amazing because you can create your own burger and the sky is the limit.  Every kind of cheese and sauce you can think of plus different kinds of meats including veggie.~~#~1
I love outdoor malls and this is one of my favorites.  Why?  Because not only are there cool stores, but there are some great restaurants here too.  NoRTH  and Chloe's Corner are two of my favorite places here. (separate reviews for each)I also enjoy walking around and enjoying the outdoors.  I typically park in the lot near Chloe's Corner and walk from street to street, window shopping and sitting down at a bench or two to enjoy the scene.Will be back soon.Return Factor - 100%~~#~1
I would not recommend this business. Their bill exchanger is broken with a sign that states "repairs are not scheduled". The attendants do not have cash so any bill denomination you insert in their machine will be loaded to a pre-paid card, minus $0.50 fee. Those machines also malfunction often causing purchases of new cards when you are only trying to add funds to an existing card. Each card costs $0.50, no refunds. I put the card in my purse and when using it at the dryer, got an error: Card Damaged. No one available for balance refund. Must buy new card. The front loaders leak detergent. The attendants do not speak English. Over two visits, I lost $2.25 in fees and a malfunctioned card (that balance was lost). There are cleaner, cost effective, customer servicing laundry facilities in the valley---I suggest you use any of them. Just not this one on Indian School and 7th Ave!~~#~0
Simply amazing! The food was out of this world! We absolutely loved it!~~#~1
5 stars for the special fishes. The wild caught salmon, the ono, and a couple other atypical fish they had this past weekend. It's been months since I've been here (I'm wondering WHY it took so long to come back). Their fresh fish has always been the highest quality and fresh. I'm sashimi all the way - no rice to muss things up, and no desire for most of the cooked stuff - so my rating is really based on the fish experience. And the salmon skin - excellent rolls and hand rolls. I have found few, if any places in the valley with as good selection and quality of fish. Prices are certainly not cheap, but the if you are all about plain slices of raw fish, it's is way better than the cheaper places.~~#~1
Honestly a great rec center. They have an awesome gym, the prices are really good for family packs, and the parks surrounding the center are beautiful and well-maintained. My 4 year old daughter goes to Apples to Zebras preschool and Club Pee Wee as well. She loves her classes and they are actually helping her get ready for school. She has "homework" each week and loves going each day. I highly recommend this for parents wanting to prep their kiddos for school. Unlike the Chandler Community Center Apples to Zebras program, this one actually has a decent curriculum. Although, the other program is great as well if you are wanting a daycare type environment instead of preschool.The staff is always friendly and knowledgeable and registering for classes online is super easy. If you haven't stopped by, go check it out!~~#~1
WORST USPA EVER!!!!!!  Rude, old, angry women.  Very slow.  One sat and chatted up with her home girl for like latterly 30 minutes while people were in line.  Im not over exaggerating at all either, I had to leave to the Walgreens down the street to by tape (because the USPA charges for clear tape) and when I came back, she was still talking to her friend.~~#~0
We went to Carrabba's to celebrate my parents 40th anniversary last week. Beginning to end it was great. Charles, our server, was excellent as was all the wait staff we dealt with. The food was really good, the Chicken Parmesan especially. I'll be back for sure.~~#~1
Awful!  Worst dining experience I have had in a long time.  I wish I could give negative stars.-I wanted to look at a menu but the waiter/front of house guy kept pushing the buffet. So we reluctantly gave it a try - I wish we had just left the restaurant. -food was mediocre at best once you got past the fact that it was dry cold and tasteless -the ambiance was dreary and the incense was nauseating.-there is also no place to change a diaper  in addition to the fact that the bathroom was not stocked with toilet paper or paper towels and the floors were grimy and sticky GROSS-when it came time to pay I WAS CHARGED $100- no joke!!!!   When I brought it to his attention he acted like I was the one inconveniencing HIM!  Then, after completely screwing my finances for the day he had the nerve to get on to me about my card declining when he tried to charge it for the correct $9 amount.  Fully embarrassed and infuriated I had to ask my friend to cover me.I will NEVER return to this establishment. There are so many other better Thai restaurants in the area I don't even know how or why these people are still in business! DO NOT go here!~~#~0
Cowboy Ciao...well...no. Yeah you have all heard the hype, excellent food, etc...! It was medicore at best. We had some small plates just to test the waters at this place. I have been wanting to try it for years and finally we got a chance to go. What a complete disappointment. We had the chopped salad, server upsold us from the $6 salad that seemed better IMO. The chopped salad was nice for about 3 bites, then it got boring. So boring I could barely taste it after the 4th bite. Not real strong in flavors, not enough salt to bring out the flavors, very blaaa!  Next we moved on to the mac and cheese. YUK! Absolutely aweful. Dry, flavorless with a hint of spice. Boring. No real cheese flavor, totally disappointed but ate it anyway. Next we had the dungeness crab enchilada's....boring!! No real taste of crab in the enchilada even though I did have a OK amount in there. All I could taste is the spicy cream sauce poured on top. Very bland, never a taste of fresh crab that would have made the enchilada. Not good at all. We did have sampler desert plate (on the house) which was very good. The mousse was great, cheesecake was excellent but I was slightly disappointed again in the bread pudding that is so talked about. Not very flavorful, little dry and the compote overpowers the bread pudding, sorry but vanilla ice cream alone works best.Overall, totally disappointed. Will never go back. I have had better....way better for the same price. Service was great though, our watress was wonderful.~~#~0
Went with my wife and her sister for lunch.  We shared a plate of calamari and it was perfect, to say the least. Crispy with a light batter and not over cooked. I had a Vietnamese spicy beef noodle bowl and was immediately won over. My wife had a crispy chicken and egg noodle bowl and couldn't say enough about how great the lunch was ... If we lived here it would be a regular stop for us. Hidden away, great staff ... No way you can go wrong.~~#~1
Order the SAM BURGER  and add Egg and Avocado... AWESOME.~~#~1
I love the food here. I was born and raised in Manila so I have been homesick for Pinoy food. Everything at this place is baked or cooked on premises from scratch. I had the lechon kawali and it was crispy good. I have tried the dinuguan ("pork chocolate stew") with rice and puto -- deelish! My American fiance loves the Pancit Bihon Guisado. We both love the macapuno tart and the special halo-halo. This is a rare sit-down Filipino restaurant with friendly servers. The rest room is clean, complete with amenities like hair spray. We are on our way there today for our nth visit and don't mind having to drive from North Scottsdale. We stop by Fry's Electronics while we're there as it is nearby and we kill 2 birds with one stone. Malinamnam!~~#~1
I can't say enough good things about Stinkweeds.As an indie music nut, it really is the best place to find limited release CD's, EP's and albums that I couldn't find anywhere else.  If they don't have it, they'll order it.Walking in, you really get the sense that this is a shrine for music.  The staff is knowledgable and helpful.  It's like you're talking to one of your friends who listened to way too much music in high school.I'd hate to think what the lightrail construction is doing for their business.  I do my part by buying all my music there.  And, hey, you should too.~~#~1
I go to CB for breakfast on Tuesdays. Always a very good breakfast, no wait and great customer service. For a chain restaurant I am very impressed with how much the staff seems to care about your time in their restaurant. It is clear they want  you to have a great experience in their restaurant. So many different places to try for breakfast. I have yet to try these places cause Crackerbarrell has given me no reason to go elsewhere. Really like their coffee too. The staff always makes sure I  do not have an empty cup and even offer a to go cup of coffee. Keep up the good work CB.~~#~1
Had a very good salad there today - Voodo Chicken Salad.  Less than 700 calories, and filled me up.  I asked for the house balsamic, it's pretty amazing.  Might have to eat there for lunch again tomorrow!~~#~1
The best donuts I've ever had.~~#~1
Ghetto!  You know, I realize we live in Arizona and grass is hard enough to grow in our ridiculously harsh climate, and having dogs trample all over it all day makes it even harder.  That being said, I have visited many dog parks with grass.  So, can someone explain to my why this dog park is 100% gravel?  I'm not even sure it's all gravel, I think there may be some needles and broken glass mixed up in there.  The place is all sorts of hilly with nasty scratchy bushes everywhere.  Our dog, Rally, did not care for this place at all.  After sniffing the perimeter, he came back and laid down next to us.  Also not a good place for people, as there is only one bench and very, very minimal shade.~~#~0
Orange roll, mido roll! This place has the greatest sushi for the money I've had in town. The mido roll is my favorite roll ever. I'm not the most experienced sushi eater, but I've had enough now to tell quality for the money, and this place delivers. Like another reviewer said as well, I too drive 40 minutes one way just to get there. Maybe Mido needs to start a caravan service or start another location farther north? :-)~~#~1
I was taken aback by how good I thought this place was.The server was SUPER nice and friendly.The food was DEEEEEEEELISHI *loved* all the different bbq sauces right there on the table.  Seriously, it was my favorite part.  Because I love sauce.  Lots of different kinds of sauces.  All over my tender meats.  Delicious.The best part... how flippin' cheap it was!  We went during lunch time (which is 7 days a week), and I think my two meat meal with a side item and cornbread was like $7.99?AWESOME!I'll return I'm sure.~~#~1
Every time we visit Mesa, The Blue Adobe Grill is top on our list of places to eat!  Everything on the menu is OUTSTANDING!  Service starts with tri-colored chips served with one of the tastiest salsa that I have ever had.  Order the Cruz Caddy Margarita - served by the glass, 1/2 carafe, or my favorite - the full carafe!  As for the menu, it is extensive and so hard just to choose ONE item!  My usual choice is the green chili adovada triple stacked enchilada smothered with green chili sauce and of course, topped with a fried egg!  OMG!  Really, you must try this place - you will not be disappointed!~~#~1
Horrible food.~~#~0
AWESOMEWe went here for restaurant weekAWESOMEI had the butterfish app, spicy filet entree, and strawberry melon dessertOMGSOOO GOOOOOD!!!!I'll totally come back to this place.  I love.~~#~1
Consistently good food and perceptive service. Gluten free menu available. Even when crowded, they provide prompt take away.~~#~1
What can I say?  This is my favorite place in the world to eat or drink.  I don't know where to begin.At both locations whether it's busy as all hell or dead, we are always seated pretty promptly.  The beer is top notch.  Kiltlifter is my #1 favorite beer of all time.  I've tried them all and they are all very competitive but Kiltlifter takes the cake.Onto the foodies.  Without a doubt, any burger on the menu is going to be monstrous and delightful.  Mushroom and Swiss is my backup but I've recently fallen in love with the Jalapeno burger.  It's cream cheese, roasted jalapenos (not spicy) and onion straws.  For $9 you can't beat it.  I really haven't strayed away from my favorites (I tend to stick with what I love) but anything anyone has ordered on the menu, there has never been a complaint.Without a doubt, if you are just visiting for a day or two in Tempe or Scottsdale, this is the place you want to go for lunch or dinner.  It will save you on the pocketbook and you'll leave with a smile on your face.They also play wonderful music and have lots and lots of television.  I have also never had to wait longer than 5 minutes to sit at a table.~~#~1
When only a serious cut of beef will do, prepared and served by another (instead of your backyard grill)--go to Fleming's. Very nice restaurant with professional waiters, a great menu, and tasty wine list.Although, I've eaten several fine meals at Fleming's, the reason for this recent review is a new discovery: the PINNACLE of hamburgers for $6 dollars at happy hour. A half pound Prime meat hamburger, with smoked bacon, and choice of cheddar, gruyere or blue cheese on a toasted challah bun. Damnation!! best hamburger I've ever eaten. Did I mention 6 bucks at happy hour? Phenomenal.~~#~1
With one hell-of-a-layover, and starving I decided to stop at the Blue Burrito Grille in the Phoenix International Airport. I had many, many choices but this restaurant's friendly and warm ambience lured me in. I sat down to a semi-cleaned table that I had to wipe clean myself. Ok. Bad. But not that bad. I was quickly greeted and offered a drink. Looking over the menu my stomach told me to go with the chicken burrito. I hadn't had mexican food for quite some time, and the restaurant was bragging that they were known for their burritos so, bonus! Bring it on. The menu read that it came with all the ingredients that you would expect from a super burrito. It was delivered fairy quickly and cut in half, which I normally do not prefer. Come on now, I'm a big boy now, I don't someone cutting my food into smaller pieces anymore. At first glance it looked pretty tasty, and then I took a bite. Disappointment set in and if it wasn't for my gross need for nourishment at that point I would sent it back and left. This large burrito had no flavor what-so-ever, except for the taste of leftover chicken that has been reheated. There was absolutely no seasoning, and one third of the burrito was shredded lettuce. Adding the accompanying hot sauce did no good either. I don't know what to say. I had another bad airport food experience, again, on this trip. And, apparently, the people who were sitting two tables away were having their own bad experience as well, so bad, that they got up and left. In the end, SEASON YOUR MEAT! YOUR FOOD! Ambience is nice but food, especially mexican, usually has great flavor, so give it to us. Now that I am home I will be visiting my favorite taco truck in Oakland where I can get a real, authentic, great tasting burrito.~~#~0
I love Thai Spices!  They always have happy hour daily between 4-7pm and the staff is always friendly!  I have been to many thai restaurants and by far this is the best in food and price.  My fave dishes: Thai Panang & Pad See Ew.  Mmm...~~#~1
Again, this is one of those unfortunate situations when a place I love is also loved by many, many others. It's ridiculously busy, but it definitely did not disappoint. Because of the numerous other patrons, it will probably be a little noisy, but it's worth it for the food and wine.The service was great and I LOVED the bruschetta. I sampled a few wines, including the wine "on tap" and they were all wonderful. There's an eclectic mix of people, ranging from young hipsters to classy elders. It's a nice place without being overpriced and pretentiously intimidating.~~#~1
The beautiful Carin and I went to the Village this morning for our respective workouts...She hit the cardio machines hard and I played squash with my buddies.As I finished my last game with one of my buddies, Jim (who happens to be a cardiologist), he mentioned that I looked a little emaciated...peaked even, and prescribed chicken and waffles, "stat" (stat is a medical term that means "with extra butter, syrup and a side of grits":)Fortunately for me there is a new emergency location for Lolo's that has opened up altogether too close to my home:)Serendipity started to smile on me when we pulled up just as someone was leaving and we scored the parking spot right in front...serendipity continued as we put our name in for the 30 minute wait, only to be called after 15 minutes...and continued to weave it's way through the entire meal, as we got our drinks right away (really, is there much of anything better than a 1/2 gallon of sweet tea with your Saturday afternoon brunch?:), and we were waited on promptly and served right away.I was saved from wasting away:)I was particularly delighted for 2 reasons:     - This was only their second day open in Scottsdale and they were   absolutely slammed with both people eating at Lolo's and with take out orders, so it looked like the service was a little uneven...but the Lolo's staff were so darn nice to everyone, most of the customers seemed  to be pretty understanding:)     - This was Carin's first experience with Lolo's, and like all of her other "first times" with me, I wanted it to be both "special" and "delightful"...I am a loving, thoughtful and caring husband:)We couldn't have asked for it to go any better, especially for going by so soon after they opened:)The chicken and waffles are every bit as good as the original location down on Yuma:)...Carin has fallen in love with Lolo's, too:)The decor in the new place is pleasant...welcoming and comfortable...I love the wash tub lighting treatments:)And the staff continues to be pleasant (trending toward sweet as pie) to everyone...they could have been pretty tight-faced today, because they really did have a ton of people (all looking to get their chicken and waffle on) come by Lolo's today.I wasn't expecting to give these guys 5 stars right out of the gate, but doggone it, they earned it!Great food, great atmosphere, nice people and now, right in the hood:)I wonder if Jim is going to send me a bill for the medical advice? :-)~~#~1
In my mind, most of the new DIY fro-yo places are pretty much the same.  What makes Mojo best?  Best fruit flavors (they almost always have either Pom-NRG or Acai available), best fresh fruit toppings, and the availability of BOGO coupons via the web.  My choice over Yogurtology, Zoyo, and the other 5-10 places I've tried in the Valley.~~#~1
Very poor experience.  Over one hour for food - poor service, very expensive - wont be back.  Will go to Deluxe anyday over this joint.  225$ bill for 3 families.  No thanks~~#~0
I luv this place. Yes, its a hole in the wall, in the ghetto. Who cares...yes, it is a little run down. So what. The red chile beef plate and burrito are scrumptious. Big chunks of meat, sauce is flavorful, not bland at all and not too spicey. I would recommend getting your burrito dbl wrapped, because it does fall apart. You can also buy their homemade, still warm, tortillas for $3 a dozen. I would eat here everyday if I could.~~#~1
Stayed here again because of the convenience to the light rail. My husband and I along with 2 friends had tickets to the George Strait concert and wanted to not have to fight traffic so we chose the Radisson. Check in was a breeze and the front desk clerk upgraded our rooms to Cabana suites...free of charge. Once again the room was extremely clean and had been recently updated. Brian down in the bar was great for happy hour..and he has a heavy pour. Check out the happy hour specials, they have a list of specialty martinis for $5. We love this location, sure it's off the beaten path and across the street from an adult bookstore but everyone is always friendly and pleasant and the property is taken care of and the best part it's 2 blocks from a light rail station. Catch it and enjoy a concert or sporting event downtown without the hassle or cost of parking.~~#~1
If you've been shopping somewhere like Bath and Body Works, you need to wake up and smell the roses. Lush is without a doubt THE best store for lotion, soap, and well, cosmetics.It's winter and my hands are dry? They have something for that.It's summer and I'm feeling a little icky? There's tons of stuff for that, too.This place smells like heaven, and I think every employee is high from the flower fumes, because they have more energy than a toddler with a sippy cup of Red Bull. Most of the products are completely natural, with tons of vegan options. I find something useful EVERY time I visit!Even the most macho gentlemen should feel no shame shopping here. Ladies love a man with good skin!~~#~1
I'm so happy I found you! I felt like I was on vacation while I was hanging out there, it was such a nice change from all the corporate coffee places. Really cool space, friendly owner and wonderful cappuccino.Thanks Cartel and Yelp!~~#~1
Don Arbuckle knows Marketing. He is not just about handing you a catalog and wanting you to pick out something to sell you. He interviews you to find out what is going to work to further promote your business. I was so impressed with his work. I ordered temporary tattoos to give to students who came to our Kidz 'n Power Class as a incentive for them to practice the material taught. Their parents quizzed them every couple of days to make sure they were retaining the information taught and then the child would earn a tattoo. This was a brilliant idea. Thanks Don for thinking outside the box. I highly recommend everyone talk with him so he can help promote your business too!~~#~1
This is my favorite course in the greater Phoenix area. The course is challenging, and the views are amazing!This course is one that for some reason is generally overlooked as one of the best (in my opionion the best)  course in Phoenix. It is off the beaten path a lttile, (sitting in Fountain Hills) but is really worth the extra 10 minuet drive. Staff is excellent, The last 6 holes (the Wicked 6) are a fresh idea in ending a course, and I enjoy it thuroughly. The practice green is well kept, and is a great determination of how the course greens are. The chipping green is one of my favorites in town.Cart girls are friendly, and always smiling. Prices are just right!Im always coming back, and they never give me a reason to not come back!~~#~1
We brought a big group of kids today 100 +.. We had 10 chaperones. And they let us play for free. I love that all the staff are young.and let the kids enjoy their time to let loose. Not a good place if your too old to enjoy your self..and all you want to do is harass the staff and complain..~~#~1
Been to this business 5 times now, spent $1000 dollars on my car and it still isn't fixed. Terrible customer service. Will not be returning. Might as well go to a dealership because they charge less and will actually fix my car.~~#~0
If a "Kurt" picks up the phone or tries to assist you, hang up/ leave immediately. Total dick. He convinced me to go in for a new battery, quoting me at $75 after taxes and labor (compared to $85 @ auto zone). After he installs it, he tries charging $85. I very kindly reminded him of the original quote and conversation, and he kept saying "everyone pays taxes, we all pay taxes in this country" literally at least six times. I could not get in one word edgewise, as i tried to remind him that his quote was the price AFTER taxes. Whenever I tried talking, he said "I'm not going to argue with you," literally six times. Complete asshole. I asked for a manager then he proceeded to begrudgingly give me the discount he originally offered me. Never ever going back to this shop, all of my experiences here so far have been very unsatisfactory. Calling in tomorrow to complain about "Kurt" (fitting name for a very curt douche).~~#~0
I have lived in this complex since June of 2009.. I chose it because of the descent prices and proximity to work. Generally I would say I have been pleased with living here but the longer I have stayed the more learn and the more I want to move out. Things I learned after moving in or since: the store owner of the internal 'market' was murdered a couple years back by a tenant.  Within he last year a female tentant was raped mid-day by two indivuals, two different instances of tenants dying from drug overdose, 11 first floor apartments were broken into in a month and had their flat screen tv stolenA friend of mine had his computer stolen from his car while parked right in front of a security camera. The front office has not been helpful or concerned about this. Their initial response was that 15 new residents were moving in and they would not get to the tapes... a couple days later they stated corporate would have to review the tapes. It has now been almost three weeks and they still have not contacted me regarding any of this.. I realize theft is a problem every where.. but they clearly don't care about my concerns. Other (Non-safety) issues: Pool maintenance.. The pool near my unit was shutdown by the city for the majority of the year last year. All winter the pool was shut down the the point ducks moved in..then in the peak of pool season they finally drained it to re-tile and make repairs.. but the time it was open again pool season was nearly over. Other pools are frequently dirty, without operable chairs, or the key to enter has been changed. Lights: Many of the lights around the complex are burned out or broken.. The light by my unit is out, it was replaced a couple months back and burned out almost immediately.. I am specifically not calling to report it to see how long it takes for a repair. Cleanliness: Many of the tenants, (myself included) have dogs. There have been periods of time where everywhere I look there seems to be dog poop and all the bags to pick it up are gone. I have also noticed a lot of the tenants toss chicken bones into the grass and bushed around the grills. I have seen trash/dead birds/grass clippings/vomitt left for days at a time. Oh and if you choose to move in and then wish to leave.. you better save up if you want to break your lease it is going to cost you BIG TIME~~#~0
The presentation is flawless, the service is spot-on and the food is awesome!!!The Salmon Superfood with Quinoa is easily one of my all-time favorite meals ever!!Don't miss the fabulous $5 drink specials during Happy Hour!!~~#~1
Had to have some reset on the iPhone. Came out of Ipic movies and the  store was just closing, but the lady at the door offered to set up an appointment for me the next day...really nice since they were closed. Came back the next day, waited 10 minutes - only 5 minutes later than the 11:10 appointment I had and they fixed it quick and easy! Thanks Eric and the lady the night before ( so sorry I forgot her name),~~#~1
This review is not a review of the store but of AT&T wireless service in general.  AT&T is the worst wireless service I've ever had.  I have more dropped calls and less bars in more places than any other carrier I've had, and I've had Verizon, T-Mobile (the best) and now AT&T.I would have never switched service if I didn't have to in order to get my iPhone.  And for the record ... the iPhone is the best object I've EVER owned.  I recommend you avoid AT&T wireless at all costs (unless you want the best phone in the world, only then is it worth it).~~#~0
We love this place and go at least twice a month. The service is consistently good, as well as the food. Love the salsas and green sauce---so good! It is reliable, clean, fast, and inexpensive. We have been going for years and have always had good waiters! Great for families!~~#~1
Love this place!  It's definitely not fine dining ... it's just a mom 'n pop that serves great food.  Best part of the decor is the framed pictures of scenes in Greece.  But the food!  Fresh, great quality ingredients, great sized portions, reasonable prices.  I'm originally from Chicago, and I think the owners are, too ... going to George's reminds me of being back home.  Great gyros served with a yummy and substantial Greek salad is my fave!~~#~1
Every time I drive by Phoenix,  I try to stop by and get me some Streets of New York pizza.  Love me some of that.  So  good.  I wish there was one in LA and I wish there was one in El Paso.  I could just see it now.  Get a few pitchers of beer, have some of their bangin wings and finish it off with a large pizza (pepperoni & sundried tomatoes and extra sauce please).  Then again, I'd probably be 400 lbs.  by now if it was here.I wonder what their other food items are like?  I've had their pasta once too.  I dont remember what it was, maybe some sort of alfredo,  I just remember really liking that as well.  I'm  not sure what it is, that I love about their pizza.  I think it's just a good combination of bread sauce and cheese.  Maybe,  it's part of my psychosis where when I first lived in Phoenix,  I was generally too poor to eat there often so it became this sort of luxury and a symbol of success every time I eat it.It can't be that bad.  There's a shit load of them now since I've returned to phoenix.  Before, I only knew about only one or two.  I hope they haven't gotten so big that they have to cut corners on their recipes to keep up on the profits.  That would suck and I think a lot of franchises yield to that practice and just get shittier through the years.  Well, the last time I had it was over xmas break and it was still bangin so keep it up, Streets of New York.  You'll be seeing me again next road trip home.~~#~1
I really enjoyed the breakfast. I had the short rib benedict and my friend had the green chili pork tostada with 2 eggs over easy on top. For the restaurant just being open for 2 days I thought all in all things were good.  We sat at the bar and had very good service and the prices we very reasonable. I will be going back for breakfast at least once a week.~~#~1
I went by this location for lunch today, only to see a big CLOSED sign by the entrance.  Other cars came in too so I'm assuming it recently shut down.  I had lunch there 2 weeks ago.  The sign said that the Gilbert location was still open.~~#~0
What the hell happened to this place?I used to love Chino Bandido... their wacky Mexican/Asian combos seemed to give me consistent mouth-gasms every time I'd go there. Within the past year or so however something changed, the staff went way downhill and the resulting food that comes out of the kitchen is a sad and pathetic shadow of what it used to be. Just to illustrate this point, I decided to give this place another shot a few weeks ago and upon walking in (the place was empty by the way) I was greeted with a "wassup' by the main kid at the register... nothing more than that... just "wassup" with a look on his face like I was a rival gang member entering into hostile territory... not very welcoming to say the least. After ordering my combo dish 'to go'... I was treated to about a 15 minute wait, and while I was waiting the three kids working in the kitchen were rapping with each other. Some of the words coming from their mouths are probably too harsh to include in this review. It was obvious that they were paying no attention to my food that was cooking. It was so uncomfortable to be sitting there that long, staring at a group of clueless kids making fools out of themselves... I almost walked out without my food even though I had already paid; because let's be honest... the chance of this food being decent at this point was near zero in my mind. After my long wait, and being handed my bad of food by one of the delinquent-looking employees (who by the way didn't mutter a single word when giving me my dish or when I left)... I went home to uncover what horrors awaited me in that styrofoam container. Let me just tell you my friends, it was not pretty. It looked like someone had taken an ice cream scooper and just plopped a pile of beans on top of a soggy tortilla and rice... then put in on the floor and stepped on it. It was a mushy pile of greased up nothingness... no substance, just a poor excuse for a pile of food that could be mistaken for animal excrement.By no means should you go here, unless they revitalize this place or hire some new staff... so this is your warning; avoid the Chandler location like the plague!~~#~0
Cafe crapas.  Another mediocre sandwich shop best suited for cheap office catering.~~#~0
Love this place!! We always get their wings (traditional with hot sauce) and pizza.. so yummy!! Usually have great service as well!!~~#~1
I had done Bikram Yoga for a year before I came to this studio. I had a 30 day unlimited yoga Groupon and since this studio was slightly closer to my house I figured I'd try it for a month. I haven't gone back to my old studio.The room is huge with four rows which makes it super nice even on crowded days. The locker rooms are roomy with multiple showers compared to the one at my old studio. The instructors are wonderful. At times tough and at time inspiring, but always helpful and consistent with the class and dialogue (a complaint of mine at my last studio).But the absolute best thing about this studio is the sense of community here. They have potlucks and fundraisers for charity and parties every now and then. It is really great to get to know instructors and fellow students outside the classroom.  It is tough some days to put yourself in a hot room and practice yoga, but you always feel welcomed and at home when you come here to practice.~~#~1
We got food poisoning from coming here! The wait was long, the food average, and a night of praying to the porcelain god made this whole thing a terrible experience.~~#~0
I will have to pass!  After many good reviews from friends and other individuals my fiancee and I went here for dinner. The service was incredibly slow (it wasn't a busy night), and the food was nothing to rave about. I got the ribs and it was tough and chewy.Edit 1/21/2012:In response to Joanna's comment I thought I'd post my e-mail response to her in further detail of my experience.  I figured the further detail might be helpful to other yelpers as well!"The food was adequate I had the ribs, which seemed rather tough and chewy.   Typically I am most forgiving when it comes to food and would be happy to return to try another entree; just because I might not enjoy one meal, doesn't meant I can't enjoy another. However, the deal breaker would have to be the service at the restaurant.  The wait staff took way to long of time to come back (after we requested a moment to look over the menu), we had someone else who worked there passing by to get our waitress.  The wait on our food after our order was a bit long, roughly more than 25-30 minutes and our waitress never came back to refill our drinks or checked back on us after we asked for our refill.  When we got our bill our waitress took too long.  In fact, my fiancee got up from our table to find anyone to help us pay for the bill. "~~#~0
no one has reviewed this place? really? i guess i shouldn't be surprised because when i first moved back to phoenix and someone said we should go bowling in sunnyslope i thought they were on meth. and the bowling alley would prolly be a great place to score some more.even when you see it from the outside, you will be like "uh-uh, i ain't goin in there." but the inside of this place has been DRASTICALLY remodeled from its early days. it is actually the nicest and coolest bowling alley i've ever been in. its got an awesome bar with flat screens and great beer on tap including stella. its got some pretty good pop art hand painted all over the place. and just overall they did an amazing job with all the furniture, carpet, and carpentry required to turn a p.o.s. bowling alley into a great hangout.they of course do the friday and saturday night late night bowling thing. it's actually been the best when the guy who runs the counter just picks the music, a lot of indie rock and other good stuff. other times i've been there when they hired a d.j. it has been less inspiring.but overall this place is awesome. if you haven't been yet you need to give it a try despite its absolutely terrible location.~~#~1
Oh Cornish Pasty Company... your acoustics aren't great and your tables do need a bit of cleaning but your food is so delicious I see and hear nothing else. The bangers and mash pasty coupled with a side of mushy pea is quite possibly the best thing I've ever had. Top it off with great service and a beautiful atmosphere and I'm in love. I have heard that they are opening a location in Vegas and implore anyone from management reading to open a Tucson location!~~#~1
Danielle and Sandra were so excited to take me to this place...telling me that it's so me.  Upon walking in...they were right...AZ 88 had me at hello the minute I walked in!  Cool art, modern space, unique/fun drinks, pretty people and good food!Since there was a wait we decided to hang out at the bar and order drinks.  I think I ordered maybe the gayest drink on the menu...I mean it had sugar confetti in it and champagne!  We also ordered the fries with the three dipping sauces...really good and I loved that they were waffle fries!  When we got to our table, Sandra ordered her usual chicken dish, Danielle got a salad and I got the cheeseburger.  Everything was great and I liked that you got sides of fries and fruit.  The night even got better when I ordered a Caprihana and they gave it to me with a pink sugar stick...seriously this plays KNOWS ME!~~#~1
Everything I have eaten from here has been delicious!  Seriously some of the best ribs I've ever had, smoky and tender.  If you're daring, get the hawg dawg, cheese stuffed sausage wrapped in bacon, Yum!  Love their beans too, smoky and sweet, nice balance.~~#~1
This place is extremely sub par for a place that specializes in tacos. I'm pretty sure that they use canned chicken for their tacos & burritos and London broiled low-grade beef (which they try to pass of as carne asada). All in all, I could make their menu at home and have it taste better. The prices are cheap so I guess that you get what you pay for; however, I could get a much better tasting burrito at Chipotle or a local Filiberto's type of restaurant for the same price. I've given this place two chances to change my mind and my feelings have only solidified.~~#~0
The Barrio Cafe is one of the best Mexican joints in town. If you are looking for traditional Mexican you might be disappointed with Barrio because Barrion Cafe serves what i like to call neuvo Mexican. I can't really explain what i mean by that...LOL...all I can tell you is that the food is FANTASTIC. My favorites are the Enchiladas del Mar and the Lobster Quesadillas....YUM. Oh did I mention the table side guacamole? Yeah it's the BOMB. So if you want one of the best Mexican meals in town with a twist then Barrio is where it's at.~~#~1
So disappointed with babbo.  Our family has been going there since it opened up.  The pizza is amazing and I love the salads.  Unfortunately, they only receive one star based on our most recent experience.  We picked up a pizza and brought it home.  When we lifted the pizza lid, our pizza was so sad looking.  It looked like someone forgot to add the sauce and we probably had about 3 ounces of cheese, sparsely sprinkled on top.  We called babbo and spoke with the manager. He said there was NOTHING he could do unless we drove back to the restaurant.  We live about 25 minutes away and asked if they could mail a credit, or credit our debit card.  The answer was no.  So sad.  I love the pizza, but can't stand poor customer service, especially when I have been a loyal customer.~~#~0
Rhythm Room- by far PHX's best venue. It will be no shocker in 2010 when every concert goer in PHX becomes acquainted with Rhythm Room. It's going to pick up the slack for Phoenix's lack of venues...which is good, b/ this place is great. Way better than the clubhouse...21+ can actually see the stage! I'm rooting for you Rsquared.~~#~1
While visiting the Chandler area, I decided to check out Grimaldi's off Ray Road. Holy Cow! I ordered the Pesto Pizza with chicken and garlic (recommended by our fabulous waitress, Jess), and the White Sangria. The ambiance, the food, and the friendly service is enough to make me a repeat customer. Just two weeks later, I strolled in again with my date, and Jess remembered us from the first time. I like Grimaldi's because it's genuine. You DO get what you pay for.~~#~1
I go to this SB's every morning on my way to work. The staff all know me by name, scream good morning to me as I haul my sleepy ass in there every morning and they know what I want and make it fast.  My hat goes off to Misty, Thomas, Jade and all the others who get me in & out as fast as they can and with a smile.~~#~1
Delicious as always. Enchiladas or tamales or the Huarache burrito are all my favorites. Fresh made chips and sauce are a plus. Prices are extremely cheap by airport standards. I was here tonite eating my food and witnessed an unruly and abusive customer that had a little too much to drink and was getting mouthy with not only the cashier but also the old woman next to him in line. This idiot was actually threatening the manager with " I gonna ruin you on Yelp if you dont comp my meal" I heard the guy admit his food was made properly but did not like what he ordered and felt the restaurant owed him something for his buyers remorse. The police had to be called just to remove him. Really good food and ive always recieved excellent customer service. Its sad they have to deal with airport rifraff, their food is better than restaurant quailty and does not get the credit due because of the location~~#~1
First review of 2013.Before going out to dinner one night, my wife was browsing in this store and I met her there.Pretty amazing place.  Beyond me, there was not a trace of Y chromosome in the entire shop.  Amidst a few small rooms, you will find clothing, accessories, handmade knick-knacks, accessories, shoes, accessories, make-up, accessories, accessories, and accessories.  And did I mention accessories?Lots of unique, fashion stuff here and a lot of stuff you never expected--even stuff you didn't know existed.  You might be tempted to bring your tween or teenage daughter here, but there is a distinctly ADULT room here too, so parental guidance is suggested.One more plus is that the owner sells things on consignment, so if you make unique bling or interesting, wearable, girly. . .stuff. . . that nobody else makes, take it to her instead of selling it on Etsy.  If she likes it, you may have just found a place to sell it.You've been to the corporate mall stores--now try Trampolina.  If you're looking for that one thing that will complete your look and you haven't found it yet, you may just find it here.~~#~1
I can't tell you how much I appreciate this business. The owner and staff are extremely helpful, they are pleasant and down-to-earth, they know their trade well, and I have never felt pressured to do something that I didn't need to.I regularly visit them for my auto maintenance from oil changes to more heavy stuff. I had the stupid idea to visit a dealership to get my services done and felt completely ripped off. After visiting the C&R the next day, they went through leaps and bounds to make sure my car was road-ready...far better than a certain Toyota dealership near Mesa Riverview.I can't recommend them enough. Great prices, honest staff, and the willingness to go the extra mile makes me a happy customer.~~#~1
We spent two evenings at Maricopa Manor to celebrate my birthday.  Joan and Scott are relatively new owners and they do a great job.  This is truly an oasis in the uptown section of Phoenix just northwest of the corner of Camelback and Central.  The light-rail is walking distance as well as an A.J's, See's Candies, DQ, and Applebees.  We parked the car once (off street parking is very nice) and didn't use it until we left.  We enjoyed the pool and full breakfasts both days.  (Same breakfast both days - my only suggestion is it would have been nice to have a different entree.  The fresh fruit cup was very nice!  Loved the gluten free muffins.)  The bed was very comfortable - nice to have comfy robes - and the snack basket was great for late night snacks.  Perfect get-away right in town!  We highly recommend this lovely B&B!  DK and Alexx~~#~1
We were looking to join a gym recently, but when we showed up to talk to someone and get a tour, they wanted us to fill out these liability release forms and sign them. Why do we have to divulge all of our personal information including our date of birth and sign a liability release form just to get a tour? We walked out. That seemed like a red flag. A sneaky way to get us on some kind of spam mailing list or something. No Thanks! We went straight to LA Fitness and they were happy to give us a tour right when we walked in.~~#~0
WOW! I love steakhouse. This  is by far my favorite.  Not sure if it was because of the food or the awesome service. Jenn was one of the best servers we have ever had, she made our experience exceed all expectations.  Steaks melted in our mouth.  Can't wait to go back.~~#~1
Love this theater.  It is conveniently located off Loop 101, they have the best pre-show entertainment with their First Look, they have the most comfortable stadium style seating, concessions selection is great, & the staff is helpful and friendly.  The stadium style seating is very important when you're short.  I have never had a viewing issue at any AMC Theater. =)~~#~1
This is by far my most favorite Chinese restaurant in the valley! I have been going here for the past 5+ years and still never a disappointment! All the employees are very friendly (also know me by name and order) and the food is GREAT!!! I am always referring my co-workers and friends to eat here.They are re-opening in their new location tomorrow and I can not be happier! I will most definitely stay a loyal customer!~~#~1
CLOSED!!They owed so many hard working people so much money. I'm thrilled that they got what was coming to them. Best wishes to the staff that they walked out on.~~#~0
When I called to ask the hours the owner snapped and said "Who is this?!". When I showed up she made us sit in the parking lot in July while she locked up her dog. Then proceeded to tell us that she was gonna kick us out after I told her I was just browsing. Then she told me I would be the last customer ever because she's closing down to turn it into a B-movie screening theater due to people like me who just browse and waste her time. According to another review she said the same thing to someone else over a year ago. My boyfriend asked if her new business would be friendlier (lol) and she said "No, in fact worse.". Horrible customer service, horribly disorganize, no wares of interest, smelled like dog and mothballs, and the owner is rude & insane.~~#~0
I go our of my way to eat here. I live in Cave Creek and thats not close to downtown. I don't care if I have to go by myself. Whenver I am anywhere near there I head in. They have the best damn machaca chimi that could ever be made. Mmmmm, Heading there with my girlfriend tomorrow for lunch and I have been drooling for days just waiting! Not a fancy place, but amazing SPICY food!~~#~1
This place is awesome, really great food and love the decor.~~#~1
My preconceived notions of Scottsdale as a place where you have to dress nice to get any service got stopped here at Guess. Walking in with jeans and old converses, I didn't expect to get much help. I haven't actually gone shopping in a long time for myself, so with a $400 gift card in tow from Christmas, I was ready to blow it. Blow it all. I was like a kid in a toy store. The sale reps were really helpful and was able to find my sizes and colors. As trendy as this place can be, it has lots of variety as far as casual dress, party dress, and clothing for almost all seasons. Love it.~~#~1
The eclectic crowd and positive vibe of this bar make it a must stop for locals and visitors.Make no mistake though, this is a gay man's country bar.  They cater to country music fans, then late night crowds when the cowboys fizzle out.  I've had a lot of people tell me, and I agree, they play the best Country music of any gay OR straight bar in town.  Usually the higher energy stuff.  If you can't handle country music, the bar is almost always high-energy dance after midnight and has after-hours till 4am Fri / Sat nights.  PARKINGThe parking lot is newly paved & monitored under video surveillance 24/7.  Security walks the parking lot at night during business hours.  In many years of going here, I've never had any problems with any of my vehicles being broken into.DRINKS / BARTENDERSThis is a drinking man's bar.  Most of the bartenders like watching people get drunk as long as they can keep it under control.  To accomplish this, the drinks are usually strong but being friendly, polite, and tipping decently usually goes a long way.  Leaving a $2 tip for $20 in shots/drinks will surely get you a weak pour the next round.  I've found that if you're nice and respectful to the bartenders here, they will make you feel like a High-Roller.DANCE FLOORThe dance floor is relatively small for a country bar this size.  That means if a line dance song comes on and you don't know the dance, the DJ will remind you to get off the dance floor so you're not in the way.  When the dance music starts, the tight dance floor makes for a fun, uninhibited evening that is even more fun if the bartenders did their job.  [wink, wink]PURSESThis is a semi-dive bar and can attract the usual dive-bar antics. Purses are limited to the size of a typical bank cash bag to keep people from sneaking in their own booze or anything else you shouldn't have in a bar.  The manager knows the door guy is doing his job when he doesn't see any medium/large purses in the bar.  The door guy wants his job so it won't do you any good to argue with him.  Also, nobody wants your huge purse banging against them all night - please leave that diaper bag in Scottsdale.~~#~1
Came here for a wedding!!  It is beautiful there.  The staff is extra friendly and super helpful.  And great with directions (the place is huge, you need directions).  They even have electric carts that drive around the ground to pick lost souls.  LOL!  The pics look fabulous!   Our friends had an outdoor wedding next to the body of water with a ball decoration that has fire and flowing water (Great back drop for pics).  We hung out at the outside area for drinks, pics, and chats after the ceremony.  Then we were led to the banquet room.  The place was very nice.  The servers were awesome.~~#~1
Treated ourselves to a late afternoon, pre-dinner crowd rush, Valentine's Day meal at Fresh Wasabi yesterday. Being a small operation, the ambiance has always been a bit austere, but we immediately noticed some new decor and wall hangings, very lovely! We also noticed that they made a distinct effort at romance for the day with fresh red roses on the tables, many of the staff wearing some red, and a fun display at the greeting station.We were greeted warmly and happily by the owner and seated at our regular table. We tried the cherry blossom roll, baked lobster roll, and the bronze medal roll this time. All were phenomenal, but we cannot imagine ordering the baked lobster roll without the bronze medal roll at the same time, they were perfectly complimentary to one another!  We paired the cherry blossom with a couple pieces of yellow tail nigiri, very soft and tender with perfect flavor, and we were happy with the match.As always, presentation was spot-on and the service was great! It was an unexpectedly fun Valentine's meal! Thanks!~~#~1
Absolute BEST Frybread place in Phoenix. The only frybread I prefer over this place would be the home-made frybread my friends Rocky and Mario would make, so you know I'm not messing around with this, folks. Try their amazing Frybread Tacos, which was vegetarian friendly, btw and if you do eat meat, their green chili is an absolute delight. Cheap, quick, and open late--- If I could give this place 10 stars, I would.~~#~1
Yuri's Popcorn is NOW open at Hilton Village Shopping Center on Scottsdale Road and McDonald.  I seriously cannot STOP eating it.  I bought the banana and cinnamon flavors.  She is very reasonable and also makes wonderful gift baskets.  You must stop by but be prepared to become addicted!!  The best popcorn I have ever had!!~~#~1
This place is GREAT!I've never been someone that enjoys frozen yogurt as much as everyone else does.  However, when a friend recommended this place to me, I decided o give it a shot on a recent hot day that we had.Now, before I begin, let me preface this by saying that I have tried other yogurt places in the past. (My boyfriend loves frozen yogurt). Unfortunately, they were okay, albeit sticky, but there was never one that made me crave going back for more.  That's when Aloha Yogurt stepped in to he picture.The minute I walked in to a CLEAN yogurt shop (SHOCKER!), the owner offered me tasting cups to try out all of the flavors, which was great because I think he has like 8 flavors of yogurt at one time or something.  Plus I am VERY indecisive.  So that was a huge plus.After deciding that I was going to go crazy, I packed a bowl of cake batter, peanut butter and coconut (All AMAZING).  I wanted to get a bowl of some of the diary free options, but I decided I would save that for another day.  I don't know what it is, but their frozen yogurt just tastes more fresh and more flavor-ful than other yogurt places.  Maybe because most other yogurt places are so corporate and all about the dollar.  You can tell the owner is there for the customers and cares about the flavors right down to the sprinkles.  (Side Note: He told us he is very particular about the sprinkles he gets from a certain vendor because they're more flavorful than most one can normally buy.)  It's that sort of attention to detail that impressed me.Then on to the toppings. Yes, they have the usual toppings, including some different stuff like carob chips, granola, kashi and mochi (for the health conscious). The brownie is especially good! It doesn't taste like the usual freeze dried brownie parts that most yogurt places include. I LOVE that they have Ghirardelli pumps for chocolate, caramel and this amazing white sauce stuff.  BUT, the creme de la creme is this liquid version of marshmallow fluff that the owner has come up with that is MAGICAL!!! It tastes like liquid marshmallows mixed with the center of Cadbury cream eggs. I wanted to take home a jar of it! Lol...Lastly, after packing everything in, I get to the counter thinking I'm going to pay a mint for this monstrosity I had created and the price was INSANELY reasonable.  I think the fact that it isn't corporate allows you to pay for the yogurt and not pay money into the pockets of big whigs that could care less about the people.  We talked with the owner and he is a really nice, young, down to earth guy that just seems to love talking with people.  It's little gems like this place that remind me why I love AZ.  ESPECIALLY when I forget, like on a hot day like today. By the way, I'm officially a frozen yogurt convert and now I check the Aloha Yogurt facebook page to see the new flavors every day.  : )~~#~1
I retract my previous statements about Cartel's ambiance. The "garage" has grown on me. Not only do I not mind hanging out here, I love it! I find myself coming back time and time again. It's a combination of the location, the baristas, and some of the best coffee in Tempe. If I could kiss you Cartel, I would. And I'd make it wet.~~#~1
Oh boy,,, I was so so excited to try this place. I guess I should know better than to have my hopes up, eh but you live an learn right. So I will spare you the gore like details and sum it all up for you,, with a line from Billy Madison.."Don't go,,, Stay as long as you can!"Bad food, Bad service, and I'm outie 5000~~#~0
The new Arcadia Crossing location in Phoenix is in the old Ultimate Electronics store. The new location is very impressive. The store inventory is not as heavy as the two other locations, however the store is neat and well stocked. There is something for everyone (men, women, girls, boys, toddler and infants). There is a baby depot department for the young ones. It is easy to walk around the store because the aisles are neat and organized. Dress sizes are in order to find your selection with no problems. There is plenty of cashier help to avoid the long lines. This location is smaller then AZ Mills but it is a perfect fit for the area as this area needed a department store. Price point is perfect to gather name brand shoes, clothes and other items to fit all budgets. The customer service is impressive. I was very happy with the level of customer service from the floor staff who greeted me and made me feel welcome.There is plenty of parking because this is location is near a shopping center that includes a Costco, Fry's Grocery Store, Target and Ross.~~#~1
I. love. Copper. Star! Why?Cool location (converted filling station with working drive thru...how cool is that?)Unpretentious (cute!) staff Cool owners (they so "get it")Fab coffee (never bitter, extra foamy when I ask!)Yummy cupcakes (never dry and lots o' yummy frosting!)Groovy musicGreat customersJust wish I lived closer....I'd be here all the time :).I dare say this is my favorite coffee place...in Phx...ever :)~~#~1
We went for the lunch buffet & came back to work stuffed & happy. It was spicy, full of flavor & delicious. Next time, I'm trying the chicken tikka...~~#~1
Went in today for lunch, and ordered the AM special. The special was originally a 3 egg scramble with provolone cheese, ham, and fresh locally grown organic spinach. I subbed out the ham for their amazing bacon, and this was definitely a treat! I got this with white toast and their delicious home fries (they're the best I have ever had). It's too bad Matt's doesn't open more locations around the valley. I really wish they had one closer to Scottsdale/ Tempe. I would be there 4 times a week!~~#~1
Best pizza I've ever eaten!  If you like your pizza loaded with fresh ingredients at an affordable price, you will love Papa Murphys!~~#~1
Many different varieties of frozen yogurt & toppings!~~#~1
This is THE go-to hangout at the Camelback. There's a bar proper with about eight seats, a couple of communal tables, then couch-and-chair seating inside. There's also an enormous patio area out back with live music some evenings and a water feature like a small moat. Happy hour gets very popular, with $5 wine and draft beers, some $6 cocktails (made with some real liquors, not house crap). One of the $5 wines is a very good Albarino, which qualifies as an exceptional bargain in my book. They also have some reduced-price appetizers at happy hour, including a generous $3 chips-and-salsa with a sampler of four different salsas (all very good.)They also serve lunch in here, and they have amazing fish tacos. I've stayed at the resort twice and made copious use of this place both times. I've never run across a staff member who was anything less than exceptionally pleasant and efficient.~~#~1
It was a beautiful day, I found parking right in front of the restaurant, and we were served quickly. What can I say - it was a 5-star day.I had a delicious cucumber & honey lemonade and a scrumptious gluten-free curry chicken with rice noodles. The curry was not spicy (by request), the chicken was cooked perfectly and the noodles were flavorful and abundant. The entree was enough for two meals. I will definitely be back for more.~~#~1
When I need a quick delicious bite to eat, I head out to Pei Wei Asian Diner.  I know that I will get quality food and excellent service.  I love the lettuce wraps here!  The Pei Wei spicy chicken is one of my other all time favorites.  It comes out with just the right amount of crispiness.  I have tried to duplicate this recipe at home and can never get it quite right!  It is much easier to head to the restaurant to have it served to me!  My food always arrives very warm, and I usually find that this restaurant is clean.  These are two things that are very important to me.If you have never tried this restaurant, you have been missing out!~~#~1
This is a five star place, no doubt.  Good for people who don't eat meat. good for people who love meat....how is that possible? This is a small operation, family vibe all the way, with wonderful lunch and dinner options.  I have personally had: the vegetable sunsubeck (i am totally spelling that incorrectly) which is veggies in a phyllo; mezza (appetizer with hummus, babganosh, cheese, pitas, etc); falafel; lemonade (awesome!) and the walnut baklava.  All of these items were good to excellent.  This is by far one of my favorite middle eastern food places in the world, even better than the Shwarma King in Bratislava, Slovakia...no joke!   I have taken people to Sahara who afterwards raved about the lamb tikka.  I have never cooked or eaten  lamb, but my friends tell me it is a difficult meat to prepare so that it is not tough and that the lamb here is excellent.  Just passing the word along, good thing this is not Law and Order or else that last statement would be stricken from the record for being here-say...or something clever that Jack McCoy would come up with...ooops..i digress..There are three different kinds of baklava...let me say that again:  THREE KINDS O' BAKLAVA:  pistachio, walnut and almond.  The honey and rosewater in the baklava really puts it over the top.  Oh and did I mention that it is moderately priced, lunch under $10, dinner for two under $40 with drinks, appetizer and desert.  Also has take out, take away, whatever you want...Okay let me give the rundown:Food:  awesomeService:  first rate, nice, warm, feels like homeAtmosphere:  busy, with people excited to be eating good foodWould I go again:  I might go tomorrow!Should you go:  yes x 100~~#~1
Dear Karim, I was sooo excited to find your place. My BFF's favorite dessert is cobbler and she loves the whole soul food vibe, so for her Christmas present it was decided i would treat her to lunch at your restaurant. We planned this before Christmas and your website stated that you were open 11am-2pm and that worked perfectly for us. So on Sunday Jan 3rd we arrived at your place at 1:15pm, appetite in tow, craving what you had to offer and you know what ? You were closed??? No freakin explanation.. nothing! Your sign even had the audacity to say open "11am - ??" Really? WTF kind of crap is that? If you're going to be so casual about your signage, why don't you update your website to mirror your lax hours of operation. You completely ruined the day and her Christmas present which we were both looking forward to. We ended up going to Hard Rock, satisfied yet still disappointed by the day's events.~~#~0
The staff was nice and accomodating, but I really wish that I was informed at booking that they were going to have a fashion show and  a live (extremely loud) band poolside all evening. (Although the band was good )  Unfortunately, the whole reason I booked this hotel was so my husband could relax in the pool/spa and that was impossible. We couldn't even relax in our room with all the noise. Our bedroom window faced the elevator and there wasn't proper window shading available for me to get dressed without an audience. I had to get ready in the cramped bathroom in order to have any privacy and that was uncomfortable. For the price I was really not impressed. I've stayed in much nicer "true" resorts for less money... and had more comfort in cheap hotels that I did here.  Had we been able to access the pool/spa during our stay I would probably have a different opinion of my experience as it is a beautiful feature of the hotel, but that feature was taken away from us and I feel ripped off. After this weekend I won't be going back..~~#~0
Great place if you want fresh fruit and vegetables at a reasonable price. Also good if you are searching for gluten free products since they have all gluten free items marked.~~#~1
Their custom built burgers are the best!!  ... You wont find burgers like this at In-n-Out or those other boring chain burger places ... They offer a variety of selections, their chicken sandwich is amazing, even their salads look delicious, (and they have homeade ranch dressing, not that plactic tasting crap in a bottle ranch dressing) also they're veggie burger sandwiches are really good too. ... Give them a try, you wont be disappointed.~~#~1
Opera is Fun! Yes it is! Tosca yesterday was amazing! I was riveted through the whole thing - and at almost 4 hours (including 2 intermissions), that's saying something. I was wowed by the singing, enjoyed the sets, was impressed by the acting, and intrigued by the story. Floria Tosca was superb, Scarpia and Spoletto deliciously evil. Honestly, I did not expect to LIKE opera as much as I have, but I've been enthralled with both AZ Opera performances I've seen this year (The Mikado and Tosca), particularly Tosca. After the performance an opera Q&A session was held for anyone wishing to stay. The AZ opera head and tenor James Flora answered questions about everything from the set, the director's mindset, the Spoletto character's triumphant ending, and the future of opera in the United States.~~#~1
How smart does one need to be to look at an order and make sure EVERYTHING is in the bag?? This is the sixth or seventh time I went to this JITB just to get home and find half of my order missing! They were not even busy! I was the only one at the window until I was leaving. Being trained to observe, I thought the female window help was looking at me sideways,I asked myself why?  well, I'll tell you. She knew I wasn't going to get my flippin tacos. One of the last things she asked me is if I "wanted taco sauce"?, that tells me she was expecting them as well and I did pay for them but when she learned the brain dead cook didn't even get them in the fryers she made the call to just send me on my way without them. With 30 minutes of training I could have an 8 year old getting EVERYTHING in the bag! So, A couple of "I'm Sorries" and "would you like to come back and get them" her job was over.  Like I'm going to #1. go out of my way and drive almost 5 miles up and 5 miles back to get what I should have gotten in the first place #2 I drive a silverado 4x4 with the big 5.3 ltr motor, it would cost me more in fuel than the tacos not to mention letting my flippin burger get cold while I do this! HOW ABOUT THIS......Instead of "I'm sorry, wold you like to come back"?Say..."What is your address, I'll have the stupid ass idiot that sent you on your way without your food bring the rest of your order that you paid for right a way! Then we'll see how many time this happens and what kind of repercussion this would bring! You see....It's no sweat off their a$$ if you get your food or not and no manager will ever know so this happens ALL THE TIME  AT THE CUSTOMERS EXPENSE!!!~~#~0
The staff here is the friendliest of any record store I've been to in a long time. They helped my friend pick out a record player and gave us great recommendations of other cool shops to check out while we were visiting phoenix.The store is pretty big and has a great selection of records. Check out the David Hasselholf calendar in their office!~~#~1
First and foremost, take advantage of their happy hour all day on Sundays. After visiting two other breweries the same day, I have to admit that Sun Up was my favorite. Their beer sampler is definitely a good way to get started. It's served in a row of glasses slightly larger than shot glasses. You'll have to ignore the temptation to pound them one after the other... at least on your first go-round. All of their beers are certainly quality and quite enjoyable, though there didn't seem to be a huge "wow" factor with any of them. In no way will I hold that against them though, as none of the local AZ brews (that I've tried) seem to be doing anything very far outside of the box.Not only should you visit Sun Up to check out their craft, you should definitely go to try their eats. Their wings are probably the  best I have ever had; fried perfectly and still nice and moist, plus their "hot" sauce had a finely-tuned heat factor. Their sliders were dynamite as were the accompanying sweet potato fries and garlic parmesan fries. The service was fast and very friendly, and the establishment (men's room included) was very well-kept. All I have left to add is: Way to go Sun Up!See you next Sunday.~~#~1
Top notch! I'm full Thai and absolutely love this place compared to trying at least ten others in valley.  The pad Thai is bomb.  The Thai Esan sausage plate is delectable. Also my fiancée looooves their take on fried rice.~~#~1
While searching online for a yoga studio to practice in while visiting Mesa from out of town from NYC, I found the bungalow.  It was a real treat meeting teachers Carrie and Robin.  They were very professional, and lead great classes.  I enjoyed meeting the other members in the classes and found the studio to be a lovely, warm, and beautiful place to enjoy yoga.  The classes were small and comfortable, with music in the background during class, and lead at a comfortable pace.  Having a nice patio to relax with a tea or coffee after class is also a plus!~~#~1
I'd been craving huevos rancheros for a week. Every time I got the "we're going to Arizona to see my family. Save your appetite for the authentic stuff" line. Well, two days into our trip and no huevos rancheros in sight, we were trolling the internet for non-chain restaurants in Tempe. Not only was Harlow's independent, but it was amazingly not in a strip mall! Don't get me wrong, they can do some amazing things in strip malls down there, but it never ceases to be what it is. Harlow's is in a low-built shacky building next to a barber shop. I inhaled those huevos rancheros (with green AND red sauces) like it was my last meal of the day. It certainly was not the last, but (don't tell the family) it was the best. Also, service was friendly, S's meal was good, the decorations were funky, and even on Christmas eve at the end of the brunch time, we were treated very well.~~#~1
I'm here at Stacy's right now and I was loving it so much I had to stop in the middle of my yelp to enjoy it. This is authentic BBQ and very worth the wait. You need cash so make sure you stop at the ATM before you go. The two of us shared a pound of rib tips and a side of sweet potato fries while I personally enjoyed a cup of tangy coleslaw and sweet, I mean sweet lemonade. The ribs were easy to pull off the bone and had extra crispy pieces I liked a lot. The BBQ sauce was amazing and had a smokey flavor so the name really says it all. The fries were sprinkled with cinnamon sugar and really could have been the dessert. For a good price we had a great meal right in the heart of central Phoenix. I can't wait to take someone else there.~~#~1
It had been at least a year, possibly closer to two, since my last visit to Padre's and I was worried that rumors of a new chef and changes in the kitchen may have made my earlier comments null and void.  I am pleased to announce that I had the carne adovada again today and it was just as tender as I remembered it. In fact, I stand behind my original review 100% -- the chile could be a little spicier, but the meat is perfectly marinated and fork tender! Delish!~~#~1
This place is great for a small group...It's small, dark & moody.  The food is delicious!  At first I was grossed out by the name...couldn't imagine what type of food would be served.  FYI-a pasty is like an empanada, but they put all types of different stuffings in theirs.DH & I shared a greek salad (delicious!) and I ordered a spicy chicken pasty & DH ordered a chicken alfredo pasty.  We LOVED our food.  Only negative is that they didn't have a full bar...so I just ordered a glass of wine. Would totally go back!  This place is fantastic.~~#~1
You must go eat at Ticoz.  Really.  It's great.  I'm not kidding or exaggerating.  If you happen to have food allergies, things you avoid on principal, stuff you hate, or are just generally picky, this is the place for you.  Saturday night found me with two wonderful friends looking at a menu that was overwhelming.  The whole experience started much as every restaurant experience starts.  Greeting, seating, menus, panic attack.  The server (who was lovely, but who's name I cannot remember) came by to ask what we would like.  Given that all of us have some dietary challenges, we start throwing the questions at him.  He doesn't know the answers, but he vows to figure it out. Usually, this does not end well, see the open letter to our sandbar server.  We just get back to our conversation when chef Holly appears at our table.  Everything on the menu is her brainchild and she knows exactly how to answer every one of our questions. Not only did Chef Holly answer our questions, she created an entirely new dish for one friend (it was incredible), whipped up a lemon apricot vinaigrette salad dressing with enough for leftover containers, and took back my chicken when it came covered in parsley.  All this is impressive, but what made the experience incredible was her attitude.  It was obvious that she was excited about food.  She saw the challenge in creating something for us.  She told us that no one has ever gotten sick from her food and she was going to make sure we weren't the first. In the end, all the service is amazing, the atmosphere is wonderful, and the staff is great.  But the food is incredible!!  This is pretty important, since we were there for the food.  All around, this was an awesome experience.  So, go to Ticoz.  Chef Holly will take care of you.~~#~1
my dad took us here for my mom's birthday -- one of the best seafood restaurants i've been to! prices are reasonable for the quality of food and service you receive. also, complimentary choice of dessert on your birthday. great place!~~#~1
I love this place.  I admit I am stuck on the Old Fashioned Turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce.  This is real fresh roast turkey (I think roasted daily but not sure) on great wheat bread, the sauce has just a bit of a bite and compliments the sandwich well.  Huge helping of turkey.  The setting is in an old pecan grove with mature trees, and grass.  A very relaxed kind of place to just enjoy the Phoenix weather the food and those you are with.  It closes during the Summer and I can't wait for it to open back up in the Fall.The perfect ending however, are the deserts.  They are all hommade, and terrific.  I can't get past the pecan pie, perhaps the best in Phoenix.  The crust is just right flaky, and it's loaded with pecans.  I'm hungry again just writing this review~~#~1
My car had been  totaled, I had my settlement and was ready to buy a car.  They had a car I was very interested in and I drove out there on a Friday night.   The receptionist waved her hand and said that the car I was looking for was "somewhere" outside and she would help me but needed to find someone to cover the reception area.  I wandered the lot for about 10 minutes and finally found the car I was looking for.  Looked it over and still no one to assist me.  waiting, waiting.... Went back inside and the receptionist was chowing down food and told me that she still had to wait before she could help me.  Wow!  How do they sell cars?  Needless to say, I went elsewhere and found a great car.~~#~0
They made my wedding cake and it was amazing.  The decorators there are artists. The wedding cake was my first experience with them, sense then I have ordered a number of cakes for different occasions and never been let downs.  They are now making my sisters wedding cake. Also if you like pastry and bite sized sweets they are the place to go. Their cinnamon buns are the best I have ever had.~~#~1
Situated in the picturesque Paradise Valley (it's named that for a reason!), this restaurant provides a nice getaway for locals and tourists alike.There are quite a few vegetarian options on the dinner menu. I strongly recommend the Polenta and Vegetable Napoleon (I especially enjoyed the red bell pepper sauce) and the Gooey Caramel Cake (if a dessert item has the word 'gooey' in its title, it's bound to be tasty!)The crowd seems to be 32+ (apart from some of the servers). Parking is not a problem-they have an abundant self-park lot for those wishing to pocket $5 that they would have otherwise shelled out for valet.If you have a sweet tooth, be sure to order a basket of their sticky buns. They usually come out before the entree, but who doesn't like a bit of sugar before spice?~~#~1
This has now become my favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix.I saw this place on Man vs Food and thought I would give it a try. The way I look at it, if a Mexican restaurant is full (and I mean full) of Mexican people, the food has to be good and I was not disappointed. The restaurant is nothing special, just a bunch of tables in a huge room. The server was very polite and seated us immediately. She brought us some fresh tortilla chips and probably some of the best salsa I have tasted. I ordered the torta Del Rey which was absolutely fantastic. It was so filling I could not finish it. I also had the mango licuados which was exactly like I tasted in Mexico. I will definitely go back and try some of their other great looking items. Try it out, you won't be disappointed. There is also another location on 7th Ave.~~#~1
What can you say, best ice cream close to my home & always consistently good.  This location is great also because it's a rocky mountain chocolate too, which means you can get all your sugar in one location, ha ha. It's clean & service is always great too, what else can I say....its good.~~#~1
My prediction: this restaurant will receive a Michelin star (or rising star), and soon.Compared to the two (one-starred) restaurants I have eaten at (in NYC and Napa Valley) I would say the cuisine is par and the service/experience is even better.I particularly appreciate the expanded take on indigenous cuisine in each course- from the amusee to the sorbet palate cleanser to the dessert.  And the primary dishes off the menu do not disappoint.  Table-side flambe' of fresh marshmallow and a drizzle of liquor before pouring the soup into the bowl?  Gorgeous.  A few "threads" of squid ink pasta under the shellfish?  Well yes, thankyoumoreplease! I don't typically spend this much on a meal unless it is a very special occasion date with my husband.  But I was determined to try Kai while traveling to Scottsdale.  I (insert effort of bravery) made reservations to dine solo.  Every aspect of the process- phone call, confirmation, free valet, escort, table-side service (friendly and attentive without one iota of snobbery!), and departure (chocolate truffles to go and a handwritten thank-you note from the lead waiter and a bottle of VOX waiting in my car!)- was the definition of "above and beyond."The prices are steep.  And OH SO worth it.~~#~1
I LOVE PHO!! I love hole in the wall joints.  This is definitely a hole in a wall.  Have I told you I love PHO?  It's my comfort food and Da Vang brings it home.  Old Vietnamese dudes hanging out and chilling, Vietnamese waiters wearing knockoff brand clothing; what more can you ask for at a PHO joint?  I always order the Pho Tai just to checkout the broth first minus the extra stuff.  Yep, it passes the taste test.  Don't forget your Vietnamese coffee - can't eat Pho without one.  I definitely recommend this place - if you're afraid to come don't worry it's AZ you can carry your weapon and conceal it!~~#~1
I  really miss this place since we moved to California. It is owned by a lovely couple who treat you as though you are their only guest even when they are really busy. The shrimp korma is my fave and my husband favors their chicken tikka masala. I can also never say no to there Aloo Gobi. Definitely worth checking out.~~#~1
The 'Bowl' of soup is literally smaller than the cup of soup!!! Shame!!Still no wifi???~~#~0
I came here after I landed in Arizona for a late night meal. We arrived 8 minutes prior to the kitchen closing but they still allowed us to order. The waiter in general was expressionless but I appreciated the fact that he didn't show annoyance of us ordering food.Appetizers:1) Fire Chips: I'm not a fan of potato chip but omgoodness, these were addicting! The crumbled blue cheese and the hot sauce especially made it irresistible.Entrees:1) Burger Au Poivre II (with peppercorns, crumbled bleu cheese & bacon)2) Picnic Chicken Sandwich (sliced chicken breast, sliced pears, pecan halves, Gorgonzola cheese, mayonnaise, mustard and Romaine lettuce on pumpernickel bread)Both were very good, and the portions were big. The waffle fries that came with it were very good, and I liked that they included some fruit on the side.Drinks:1) Dirty martini: strong but made very well. I couldn't decide what kind of olives I wanted so he gave me one of each2) French martini: one of the better ones I have tastedThe ambiance is very trendy, both on the inside and outside. Definitely recommend it for an overall great dining experience!~~#~1
This is hands down my family's favorite Greek restaurant.  It's a family-run place in a strip mall but so, so much more than the location and the sparse decor.  The best way to sum up the place is what the lovely woman who works the counter once told my mother: "We make everything with love.  You have to make money to stay open, of course, but it's the love that keeps people coming back .  You can tell when there's love in the food."  I love the warmth of this place, Greek music and all.The made-to-order gyros is the thing to get, a sandwich for a big meal and the plate for a huuuge meal.  The meat is hot and fresh (which is not always the case at Greek sandwich places) and the vegetables are crispy.  The fries are always piping hot.  The falafel is also great.Eat here and eat here often.  Know that there's someone in SF that wishes he were in your place as you hungrily eye your neighbor's ramekin of tzaziki sauce...Beware!  The place closes at 8 and sometimes by 7:30.  All good things...~~#~1
Bad Donkey is the north Phoenix answer to Cheba Hut.  No, it's not the same, but if you are jones'n for a top-quality toasted sub it's a good place to go.I had their "Grass on a Roll"  - whole bunch a fresh veggies, cheese with "Bad Donkey Sauce".  Good eats!Cute place, good food and a very friendly staff.~~#~1
Eddie V's is probably the best  steak and seafood restaurant in Scottsdale. Good wine list.Amazing oysters.Great sushi rolls.They can cook a steak.The side veggies are good too.The decor and furniture are very classy.  Bring a date here if  you want to impress.The band is awesome.  They are a talented trio.  Go Rebecca!Check it out.  Eddie V's is at the North East corner of the Scottsdale Quarter.~~#~1
RED VELVET.  My last trip here my credit card got declined, luckily my friend spotted me for the $38 cupcape order I made.  Luckily I moved to NYC where there's no shortage of good cupcake shops.~~#~1
When I donated my kidney a few months ago, Wendy from Petite Maison brought me 6 pints of soup. At the time, I had never met her, the chef or eaten there. How cool is that? After being on painkillers for several days, I was severely constipated. It happens. The lentil soup she brought over did the *ahem* trick, though!I finally got to go there last weekend for their late night Staff Meal, which was dessert-themed. My friend Leslie made all the desserts. The service was great, except for having to ask for water twice. There weren't many people there, but it was also after hours, so I'll forgive it because it was such a cute place!It feels like a ski lodge inside. There is wood everywhere! Cute chandeliers over the tables, too. Oh, and the bathroom was nice. Not too fancy, but nicer than most places.I will definitely come back here for a regular meal, but I wanted to get the word out about this place.Good people, who care about others in the community. Great atmosphere and for being in Old Town, douchebag-free.~~#~1
Food here is great I'm from Chicago and there beef is better than Al's Beef~~#~1
The world has finally presented me with an easy choice.  After years of wandering through life, decisions half-made or made wholly wrong, a simple and easy direction has shown itself to me: I have to move to Ecuador.Quite honestly, if the food here is representative of the native regional cuisine, I'm just going to buy a ticket, pack my cat, and head down there.  Feel free to pick over my belongings.Almost completely hidden from view, this tiny hole in the wall of a restaurant sits, waiting for those looking to find it.  The decor is bright and charming; inviting without feeling like it's trying to be ethnic.  The tables are comfortable and huge.  I had actually thought they were a bit over sized when we first sat down but, well, then food started to arrive.We were started with the obligatory chips and salsa.  And while they may not have been much to look at, these slightly greasy chips and sweetly spicy salsa are very tasty.  This little appetizer was soon followed by a plate of empanadas and a sampler of their tamales.  Now, I love tamales, so I was probably looking forward to this most of all.  These three (a Mexican red, a green, and an Ecuadorian) were not only beautifully crafted and presented, but they were some of the best quality I'd ever eaten.  If it's your first time here and you like tamales, don't pass that sampler up.  The red might not have been the most stunning, but the green is the perfect blend of cheese, pepper, and corn.  The Ecuadorian tamale was just unlike any tamale I've tried before.  Wrapped in a banana leaf, there was just more filling to it than I'd ever seen in your standard tamale.The main dishes followed in good time.  Again, the presentation on this food is just stunning.  If I had ever dreamed about being a food photographer, I'd probably start my portfolio here.  The brisket I had ordered was covered in what I can only term as a "salsa" of peppers and various other vegetables.  Combined with the meat that was tender enough to cut with a fork and the avocado slices, it was just a sublime meal.  A combination of flavors that I had honestly never experienced before.I've had (I think) real Mexican, Spanish, and a variety of other types of food.  The cuisine here is distinctly in it's own category.  I think that's what draws me back to it most: a delightfully inviting, yet wholly unknown, palate to explore.~~#~1
With a fresh coat of contemporary, Bliss attempts to fill the pews of my former favorite, Fate. Well Johnny, I preferred Fate to Sens, and I prefer most anything over my first dinner tonight at Bliss. With a concise menu of mostly comfort food, I tried the nachos, and my partner the Mac & cheese. Our food arrived within minutes, which was a plus. I confess that nachos are my go-to guilty fave, as fried tortilla strips and cheese are a delicious combo and hard to turd-up. Unfortunately, I am hard pressed to remember worse nachos. The chips were odd, more like wonton triangles. The white cheese on the nachos was the same cheese on my partner's Mac & cheese -- a bland pale cheese béchamel. The Mac was okay, nothing that competes with Mrs. White or Cheuvronts. I finished less than half of my nachos, and the waitress didn't blink an eye as she removed it after I placed my visa card next to the dish signaling my surrender.~~#~0
I have been going here for years and I love the place, great pates, mussels, and oysters.  Nice wines and wonderful service, when I am in town this is the place for me.~~#~1
Excellent service - fast, they can rush if/when you need.  Alterations are unperceivable.  Looks like you purchased the garment that way.  Have had hems and take-in's done on all types of garments.  Great work!~~#~1
Terrible service! It took TWO HOURS to have our food served, get the bill paid, and leave during the lunch hour. My coworker's salad was served with no dressing at all. It took the waiter 10 minutes to bring us a balsamic replacement. Unacceptable.The food was only so-so - the southwestern spicy burger looked like a frozen patty.~~#~0
Don't get your keys made here - they never work.  3 different times this has happened. Not a fluke.~~#~0
Simply Awesome !!~~#~1
Went here for lunch ordered the Pecan Smoked Salmon with Avocado Puree, Red Onion, Lemon-Caper Crema, and Olive Tapenade. It was only $10. I would have paid $20. It was spectacular! I also got the Chili Rubbed Hanger Steak and Asadero Cheese Stuffed Tortillas with Roasted Ancho Guajillo Sauce,Avocado Puree and Cilantro Rice   It was $13. It was tremendous. My friend got Grilled Salmon and Baby Lettuce with Sweet Roasted Peppers, Cherry Tomatoes, Fresh Avocado, Chive Risotto Cake, Tortilla Strips and Chipotle-Grapefruit Vinaigrette.    It was only $12. I think this restaurant is the best in Scottsdale. This comes from a real foodie. The service was 5 star! Off course the outdoor patio was stunning but mesquite leaves kept falling in the food. It was super windy that day. Make sure you are seated under an umbrella!~~#~1
What a grimy little corner of Mill. I was with a dinner party of graduates and we were dressed formally...whoever chose to come here after Rula Bula must not have anticipated the constant stream of questioners grunting, "hey, why you dressed like that? wedding?"The topper was being offered a shot by a group of 18-year-old boys to help them out. Sorry, I'll stay here with my husband and soberly contemplate the awful logo and--what's that there?--a pole with exposed nails fallen off from a wooden bench. If you dare come here, be sure your tetanus is up to date.~~#~0
Best german food ever! Great service. Has that feeling you're at your german grandmothers kitchen table.~~#~1

(I new old owner, Anthony,  from high school and live sooooo close) But stopped n real fast for my green T fix, since I didn't have time to drive to my fav..xtreme bean. New owner is so nice,he took time and told me all about new menu and different.L Evening events they have started like BYOB and open mic. also live music some weekends....I will b back with my Hubbie to check out new grub offerings soon~~#~1
#43. Every time.~~#~1
I love this place. Starting with the ambiance, which is small, dark, cozy, and Italian, I was impressed. We came on a cool rainy night and sat at the bar, right in front of the wood-fired oven, and the owner made friendly conversation with us the whole time.We split the Biaggia (prosciutto, goat cheese, fig spread, EVOO) and the Dona (mozzarella, pancetta, roma tomatoes, parmesan, and tomato sauce). The crust was perfectly chewy and had a slightly sweet flavor, which I love. The toppings were fresh and high-quality. I just wish we had more room, because we also really wanted to order the egg and pancetta pizza. Next time... and there will be a next time!!!~~#~1
My MacBook Pro went crazy on me with the cursor becoming possessed and messing all kinds of things up. The Apple Store "genius" said it was a hard drive problem and it would have to be replaced. Stupid answer and wrong. The Best Buy "geek" said it was the touch pad and it would have to be replaced. Wrong again, but at least he disconnected it and I used just the mouse. FINALLY I found this iStore and immediately they showed me that the battery was bulging and pressing on the touchpad causing it to malfunction. Problem solved. Guess where I'm going for Mac help from now on.  These guys are the real geniuses!~~#~1
Let me preface this by saying the Pizza and service are spectacular, five stars for those!  Why am I writing this and only giving one star? For stupidity!If the manager gave us a reasonable explanation then you wouldn't see this.My mother ordered two shots of vodka on the rocks.  She requested two olives in it... Not an unreasonable request.  The bartender came over to the table and said "we don't have whole olives, will sliced be ok?"  Huh? A bar without whole olives? Perhaps they ran out?  Ok sure my mother said she would try sliced.Presentation of the drink sucked...it came in a pint glass with the ice way above the vodka, no stir stick, and the olives? Were in a rocks glass, they weren't even queen olives, they were small sliced olives like you get on a pizza.  But I am not writing about the presentation of the drink.We got the bill for our drinks, 2-16 inch pizzas, a 12 inch pizza a Pazookie and...here it comes 2 olives!  No shit! They charged us for condiments!  We had to ask why, as we have never been charged for having a lime in a beer, or 5 cherries in my daughters Shirley Temples, or olives anywhere in the world! The bartender never mentioned and extra charge for sliced olives. $0.39 each!Now $6 a shot for vodka not unreasonable, even for rail! I am not upset about the $12 drink. The slap in the face is the charge for olives, that were not even whole!  So the manager (Carrie?) comes over and gives us some BS story that other places have figured the cost of the olives into their drink prices so that is why we have never ever seen this before anywhere in the world.  Hmmmm, how do those places know how many olives we are going to ask for? Or limes, or oranges or cherries.  You know I used three squirts of soap and three squares of hand towels when I used their restroom did I go over my limit on those? Think I should go back and have them add it to the bill? I am only writing this because I was not satisfied with the reason given to me by the manager.  My mother ordered a $12 rail drink (not call) and had to pay for condiments. STUPID!Dear Mark Russell,You have awesome people, great food, and service, however you need not charge for olives in drinks... Kind of stupid. Right?~~#~0
Whenever my dad is in the state of Arizona, he loves to frequent Carl's Jr.  Grilled chicken sandwiches with either green chile or teriyaki sauce/pineapple.  He does not eat red meat.  We walked into this location in front of Walmart at Greenfield/McKellips and saw that there were turkey patty sandwiches.  They were delicious!  We ate a quick bite and watched the March Madness on the TV inside.I got a teriyaki turkey sandwich and he ordered a guacamole turkey sandwich.  The guacamole was quite spicy, and there are even coupons in the mailers now for buy one get one free.  They are advertised as being under 500 calories each.  They give discounts to active and retired military as well as senior citizens and police/fire personnel.  Plus, we received a coupon for a free drink.  Excellent service too.  The staff were telling us there are hundreds of combinations not on the menu, and they were jovial.~~#~1
Loved this place!~~#~1
Family operated.. everything is fresh. It seriously does not get any better than this place! Some of my personal faves include the Butterscotch scone, Chicken Pesto sandwich on croissant, and of course, the infamous Scotch Kiss latte. Enjoy it on the relaxing patio with friendly neighborly folks, surrounded by beautiful, quintessential atmosphere of a small town farm. You will fall in love!!~~#~1
Take two food items which are awesome at anytime of day and build a restaurant around them and this is what you get. I don't think i could eat this fare everyday but when you're in the mood, boy does it hit the spot. The service is very good and the premises is well maintained.  The only negative thing i can say is that they serve pepsi rather than coke.~~#~1
I planned my daughter's  7th birthday here.  I set up the party plans with a coordinator at their HQ in Dallas.  Originally planned for 14 people and then changed the number down to 10.  After the bill arrived I spoke with the GM about the over charges (for 14 ppl) and he was such a prick about it. He wouldn't even look at the emails that I had between myself and the party coordinator stating that I was paying for 10 people.There was a lack of communiation between the Dallas people and the Dave & Busters at Desert Ridge.  No one ever confirmed the # before we got going. This could have been avoided.  I would have had the chance to leave and take my business elsewhere.  The GM completely ruined the day by being such a jerk about it.  I got a call from the assistant GM last night (after he read my poor survey review online)  and he tried to make it right by offering me credit towards their establishment.  Uhhh...I don't think so.  I will never be back.  I have never gotten such bad service from a restaurant manager before. We were overcharged and I just want the overcharge fees back.  I will happily pay for the rest. Do not plan your child's birthday party here.  The only reason I came here is because It is the only bowling alley up towards North Scottsdale/Cave Creek, where we live.It is a huge rip off and I will never be back.Be warned.~~#~0
very small and dirty looking and nearly no parking.  as we were in the mood for soul food and lolo's was closed, we read reviews for this place and decided to give it a shot. we called ahead, as we are 30 minutes away, the young lady on the phone told us that they would be open until 10pm. great we thought. we showed up around 645 pm and there was nobody but a gentleman at the register, chatting it up and belly laughing as we stood there awkwardly not being acknowledged. we decided to seat ourselves, we sat nearly 5 before the gentleman motioned that the menus were up where he was, still on the phone mind you. we sat and looked over the menus, still not having been greeted by anyone. 10 minutes or so later, a young woman comes out from the back and rudely states that we must leave. we asked, why? her response was they were closing in a couple minutes, and if we wanted to order we could only choose from their two specials. we mentioned that we spoke to a young woman over the phone and she had stated that they would remain open until 10pm. she replied no, nobody said that. we are certain it was her to which we spoke, as we even double checked the phone number dialed against the one on their flyers that were at the register. sorry can't review the food, may have been great but their hospitality was not. this horrible experience didn't ruin the night as we had great bbq at famous daves instead.~~#~0
Came here for a work event my husbands company was having. There were about 20-25 people and we had our own room with pool tables and dart boards (bring your own darts cuz they only have 1 set). The food was all preordered so we had a lot of different things, which were all very tasty. The waitress was always walking through getting drink refills and was very helpful giving suggestions once she told me they don't carry blue moon. They had a guy singing for part of the night, he was ok, but kept to the same type of slow songs so it got a  little boring after a while. The decor was very cool and the atmosphere was great. We will definitely be going back here.~~#~1
I eat lunch here at least once a week. The food is affordable and delicious! It is family owned and they are the friendliest people. Definitely a great place for lunch!~~#~1
Ok, now that you are reading based on the one star.... Went for a dinner for four on a Saturday night, and...The female bartender who is always there has no personality and is about as customer service oriented as an old shoe.Our waiter: took the males dinner order before the females, served salad and had to be asked what happened to our appetizer, and he clearly forgot.  The story goes on with forgot drink orders, and the delivery of desert to those of us having the prix fix menu, and the rest had to ask for a menu, and again he was surprised.  So he said "dessert    Is on me".  You guessed it, desserts were charge on the bill, as was a salad price doubled .  This was the second try with the same results in 2011.  So YES it is a land mark, and YES it is red walls and old school cool, but.... Food is OK, and service keeps disappointing ..... For the price, I will go elsewhere.~~#~0
Service was great... The food was not!  Old iced tea; the ranch dressing for the chicken, bacon, ranch quesadilla must be out at the ranch... Dry dry dry maybe I will try them in a year or so~~#~0
Wow.  I haven't actually ever been serviced here, but I will be.  Our Benz stopped working and was diagnosed elsewhere (where it was towed) as needing a new supercharger.  Desperately hoping for another (read: different) opinion, I called asking for diagnosis over phone.  He was so nice, while he told me what I didn't want to hear (it did need to be replaced), told me he was sorry for such a bummer problem, told me to remember the car has otherwise been good to me.  It was exactly how you'd want to be treated when you have a bummer, unexpected, unavoidable car expense.  I will certainly be their next regular (hopefully not that regular).~~#~1
This place is an absolute favorite of mine.  Amazing Latin fusion. Superb service each time I have gone.  Food is amazing from the cheese bread to the incredible deserts.  Order the cigar for desert if you want to empress.~~#~1
Kangaroo!  You heard me.  Last night I tried a Kangaroo burger at Stax.  Um, 5 stars for that alone.  This place is awesome.  I am so glad I finally tired it.  The whole concept is great.  The smell is intoxicating, even in the parking lot.  It's like hamburger utopia.   You mix and match different types of mini burgers, usually two is enough if you order sides.  The exotic meat section blew me away and I just had to try the Kangaroo burger.  I believe the selection changes frequently.  I also got the turkey burger, which I really enjoyed.  The patty had spices and bell pepper mixed in and the pineapple made it extra yummy with a touch of sweetness.  I tried a bite of my dinning partner's buffalo and that was pretty tasty.  The bread on these little guys is top notch too and grilled to be slightly crispy around the edges. The mini burgers were hefty.  Honestly, they really weren't that mini, I only got through one and a half.  There were some other big hits with me.  The sweet potato fries rocked.  YOU MUST GET THEM.  Okay, so Fez still has the best, but these are my second favorite.  I also love the cucumber water, so much better than lemon.  I hate that sour crap in my water, but the cucumber is so refreshing.  The only thing I didn't care for was the Mac n' Jack.  It wasn't bad, just not my style.  Too spicy and not creamy enough for me, it wasn't worth the calories.  The service was great too, my waitress was extremely sweet and helpful since this was my first visit.  I can't wait to go back. The decor/atmosphere rocked, the food rocked, the selection rocked, and of course- I rock.~~#~1
Amazing Experience. Chris- the chef and owner was knowledgeable, funny, inviting, and accommodating. We were in for our law firm's Christmas Party. Chris made the whole experience wonderful. The soup, entree, salad, and dessert all tasted like they were made with love. I will be back.This is a great place for date night or out of town guests with a hard to please taste. Make reservations, this place is small and fills up nightly.~~#~1
I had been wishing for an inexpensive korean restaurant for years. When this place opened, it was a dream come true because it was also walking distance from my apartment. Score!Huge portions. Great flavors. The lunch special comes with 3 types of meat, 2 scoops of rice, and 4 sides of your choice. I really like the sesame noodles. All for about $7~~#~1
Delicious. I try not to use that word lightly, but it definitely applies to the food in this place. The seasoning of the meat, the taste and texture of the beans and the rice, the kick of the salsas - everything is the way it should be. The staff is very friendly and the list of offerings is in plain sight, on a chalkboard menu above the counter area. Prices are great! The place is clean and has a very relaxed atmosphere (and the Food Network on the flatscreen at the bar during lunchtime ... very sneaky way of encouraging a big appetite). Nice bar area, and even an outdoor al fresco dining area where you have a view of the Phoenix Mountains. Lots of things to like about this place!~~#~1
Best yogurt in Phoenix by far. The staff always recommends flavors with certain toppings and that is how I discovered my new favorite...sour apple with caramel sauce. Yummm!~~#~1
Stuck here for 3hrs on a layover.  What to do, what to do?  This airport is huge.  It seems to be the main hub for all flights in the southwest.  Stop off at the gift shop to scan the magazine racks.  OK, that keeps me busy for only 20 min.  What else to do?  Let's try to catch up on some reviews.  What's it gonna cost me to get online?  Hmmm...Sky Harbor Public WLAN?  Could it be?  YES!!!  FREE WI-FI!!!  Makes the layover that much more bearable.~~#~1
I have been to Butterfield's several times when visiting Scottsdale, and I can't think of anywhere else in the U.S. where I would rather have breakfast.  The service and food are consistently excellent.  I usually order the same thing because it contains everything I want.  I get the California Scramble, made with EggBeaters.  This contains bacon, avocado, cheese, tomato, and order of perfectly-browned hash browns, and two pancakes.  Yummy!  Also, I always have the iced tea.  It is perfect!  Come to find out, they use filtered water and they brew a batch about every fifteen minutes (the teamaster overheard me and my boyfriend discussing the tea and filled us in on the details.)  Ask for a to-go cup when you're ready to leave.  Service is polite and quick.  No complaints here.If you like breakfast, Butterfield's is a must-try when you're in Scottsdale.  They also have lunch/brunch menu, but I have never tried anything on it.  No need to when I have the perfect breakfast every time!~~#~1
I would not recommend this car wash to anyone that has either a tight budget or a good carwash in mind. I'd decided to give this car wash a shot after hearing good things about it, and I was sorely disappointed for a number of reasons.- $11.99 for their most basic wash is fairly high, especially considering that a number of other places do a better job for more competitive pricing.- I was told that my wash would take fifteen minutes. It took them an hour. Honestly, I didn't mind the fact that it took them an hour. The fact that they were dishonest about the estimated time is what bothered me.- They did not wash my car roof. When I took my car back to them to point this out, they argued that they'd tried to get the bird droppings off and failed. Upon hearing this, I pulled over to their gas tanks and cleaned my roof myself. Most of it came off even without any soap.So, in short, don't trust these people. In addition to doing terrible work, they're also quite happy to lie to your face. Stay far, far, away.~~#~0
Freshly sliced meats on fresh bread. Kicks the crud out of Subway.~~#~1
My wife and I, along with another couple sat down in Atlas for a culinary adventure. We opted for the Chef's Choice Tasting menu. Which is a euphemism for "Whatever strikes Chef's fancy this particular day".   We called a day early to find out which wines to bring since, among the other attractions for AB, it is a BYOB establishment. We decided to bring a variety since the menu hadn't been set.Good thing, because Chefs Joshua "Lefty" Reisner and Keenan Bosworth really pulled out all the stops for us. We wound up enjoying 12 different courses. Yep, four hours and 12 courses later we walked out with our heads spinning from the intense culinary assault. This is the third or fourth time my wife and I have done the Chef's Choice menu. We've had as many as fourteen courses and as few as 9. Ha, as "few" as nine courses.Some of the high points from Saturday night:Second CourseApplewood Smoked Idaho TroutMizuna and English CucumberThings Chef Joshua PickeledFourth CourseSundowner Day Boat Santa Barbara Sea BassGrilled Baby OctopusBagna Cauda and Fried CapersSixth CourseCrispy Korobuta Pork BellyWhite Bean PureeBourbon Glazed ApricotsTwelfth CourseHudson Valley Foie GrasVanilla Pound Cake and Apricot JamMinus 8 VinegarThese guys are fearless in the kitchen. If you ever thought it would be interesting to let someone create a gastronomic adventure for you, Atlas Bistro is the place you're looking for.~~#~1
Such an amazing gem. I can't believe I never tried this place before last night. My friend and I journeyed here for the Restaurant Week menu. So glad we did. We were taken care of by Rick, who was a super attentive waiter and also extremely knowledgeable about all the offerings at Petite Maison.Started off the night with a lovely glass of champagne. Then had the opportunity to try the lobster ravioli and a wine paring that was to die for. Followed up by the fois gras, which was delicious. Then had the braised veal cheeks with blue cheese souffle, and finally the nutella brioche bread pudding - WOW. I'd come here again for sure and recommend that you try this traditional french restaurant out. Ask for Rick, he won't steer you wrong!~~#~1
Someone already said exactly what my first line was going to be... but seriously, this place is a GEM.  I've been coming here for years and love it.  This place is definitely a dive bar, but it's clean and super spacious. I'd say there's about 15 tables, and you can always find one open... free pool for a couple hours every day, 50cents per game, or you can play by the hour.  Cheapest drinks in town, hands down.  The bartender is awesomely friendly (seriously, I LOVE her), and the owner is there every day and he is also awesome.  Tons of parking, clean bathrooms, you can watch whatever you want on TV, pinball, big patio, and you feel safe.  Weirdos every now and then, but where isn't there? Bright lights, but better than the flashing lights and crazy loud music and overcrowdedness down the street on Mill.  Join a pool league, and tip your bartender well, please!~~#~1
i use to always go here.always always always.. i only stopped because i moved downtown.super strong drinks. super cheap. super random crowd, only thing in common is, professional drinkers/drunks.~~#~1
In-N-Out NEVER Disappoints. 5 stars all the way!!! =)~~#~1
Above the door when you enter it says "you will find truth inside" and the truth is..... Its awful at kazimierz.Made reservations for 8 at Peters food spot Cowboy Ciao. Also put down my creditcard to hold a spot for 8 at kazimierz for nye. Dinner was great, I dropped a grand on it (overpriced for atmosphere) walked into kazimierz where the owner Peter and the bouncer treated us like we were here to wash the windows. Very very rude owner and bouncer. they lost our name off the list then stuck us in a waiting area by the front and tried to pawn it off as our intended reserved private table. No dice Kaz, we are off to another bar... Ps the comped champaign was flat. Big let down. Big attitude.~~#~0
went here  today for the lunch buffet with Rand H. and it was amazing!!!! This place is going to my top ten list. I started with a bowl of corn chowder that was very good and then I had  a plate containing green beans with chopped bacon and onions,scalloped potatoes,BBQ pork spareribs and some pickled beets.All were just great.I went back and  got more ribs and the green beans they were awesome.then it was on to the desserts witch are lots to choose from and they are real good. I had this piece of carrot cake that had a solid pineapple top layer on it.Best carrot cake i ever had.i also had this pecan pie square but made with macadamia nuts yummm. They also had apple crumble with real whipped cream that was pretty good.  My lunch was so good this place is going to my top ten list. yum yum yum yum yum yummmmmmmmmm!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!~~#~1
I have been going to the open-air Saturday market for a while, but have never gone into the store. I have always had a pleasant time and the sellers are always friendly and helpful. In contrast to the friendly merchants outside, the grocery store people were not, at least not to me and the person I was with. Answering a question seemed like a chore to the girl behind the counter. Then the cashier, although superbly pleasant to the person checking out before us, did not provide the same to us. We are probably not the kind of customers they like or are used to?I'll probably continue to go to the open-air Saturday market but definitely skip the store.~~#~0
New Location at the Altell Ice Den in North Scottsdale is now open, bigger space the the 40th spot... Food still great. Also 18 degress the lunch and dinner joint they own is open next to it as well. I have not eaten their yet! Menu looks good.~~#~1
Rachel is an absolute gem. I wanted to send flowers to the love of my life across state lines and had no idea who I could trust. Thanks to trusty Yelp, I met Rachel. Not only has she gone above and beyond her job, she sent photos to make sure I liked them, delivered for free since I was in Scottsdale, and was very on point with all my needs. For all my cross state flower needs, Rachel will be my florist. Thank you so much for all your help and I look forward to working with you again!~~#~1
The poor quality of the products alone makes this place not worth it. Processed cheese on a breakfast bagel? Not sure what happened to this egg patty..The bagels taste good but are chewy and too dry on the outside. Sure, it's cheap food, but you get what you pay for: A slimy breakfast bagel~~#~0
I was in Scottsdale this past weekend for a little R&R before attending a conference at the Hyatt at Gainey Ranch.  My friend and I went out to Old Town for dinner one night without any reservations- - we wanted to walk around an see what looked good.   We found ourselves at Cowboy Ciao for dinner.  We only waited about 20 minutes (sat at the bar) before a table opened up.  While we were at the bar, the bartender (a woman, I did not catch her name), was very friendly. We were given a table for dinner pretty quickly.  First, the service during dinner was top notch.  Our waiter helped us select a great wine from their huge wine list.  We told him what we liked "white, not too sweet" and our price range, and he gave us a great recommendations.   On to the food-We didn't try any appetizers because we were determined to make it to the dessert round, based upon the delicious sounding desserts on the menu.   I really liked the fact that the menu had about 8-10 solid entree choices (in addition to a ton of small plates, salads, etc.) - - not too big, not too small.  When I see a restaurant trying to be "all things to all people" with a huge menu, I always wonder how many of the ingredients are actually fresh as opposed to frozen.  While I certainly wasn't in the kitchen, I can say that both of our meals tasted fresh.  I ordered a slow cooked pork shank which fell off the bone with a fork.  It was freaking amazing!  It came with these fingerling potatoes in a garlic cream sauce that was out of this world.  Nice big portion of food, too.  My friend ordered a swordfish steak with a light cream sauce and vegetables.  I tried a bite and it was really good - the sauce was light and did not over power the fish.  Overall, 2 delicious meals.  Onto dessert - - despite our efforts to save room for dessert, I found myself starring down the dessert round with a very full belly of pork and potatoes.  But alas, we are not ones who give up easily.  We ordered the chocolate bread pudding to share.  It came with some smokey chocolate ice cream.   I wasn't the biggest fan of the smokey chocolate ice cream, as I am not a "smokey" flavor person.  But my friend liked it and it was on the side so it did not stop me from diving into the chocolate bread pudding, which was really, really, really good.  Overall, I would definitely come back here if I find myself in Scottsdale again.  We had a great meal.~~#~1
Fantastic, fun hotel in a perfect location for a bachelorette party!  This hotel was highly recommended to me by another bridesmaid who stayed here for another bachelorette party; I'm so glad I listened!  - Location, location location!!  central to everything in Scottsdale.  Food, shopping, clubs, bars, Bliss spa, beautiful ppl, pole-dancing studios, everything you'd need for a bachelorette party ;)- Hotel staff were great, very accommodating.- Pool party!!  This was my first time going to a pool party "vegas style" - it's crazy!  I didn't get into the pool myself bc there's way tooooo many ppl in there and I don't even want to think about all the pee, but it's a really fun vibe, young mixed crowd, great DJ's, drinks.. we didn't get a cabana but got a great comfy area to sit & lay down that's reserved only for hotel guests - woohoo!- Shade night club!  Fancy schmancy.  Looks like this is where the party is on the wknds so staying at this hotel was perfect - get drunk..go upstairs..pass out.  Great music, awesome bartenders, mixed crowd.  Fun!- Free transportation at night in lil golf carts Heads up - you're not allowed to carry naked blow-up dolls around the lobby.. just fyi ;)~~#~1
Love this place.  Casual, good food, fun, nice crowd, not too small but not too big.Went there two time in a week and was not disappointed.  The staff is great and the food is too.  Will definately go back!~~#~1
This place rocks! The food is absolutely delicious. The Hummus is amazing and only fresh ingredients are used. We try to go there weekly as it is that good.~~#~1
This is my favorite, go-to lunch spot. The food is fantastic and reasonably priced. Service is quick and friendly, and the people that work there have been there for years, so it's always great to walk in and have people recognize you. The whole experience is even better if you can get a table outside. I even love sitting at the counter. I always get their soup--tomato is a classic and delicious, but broccoli cheese and clam chowder are fabulous as well. Egg salad sandwich is sooo good (ask them to toast the bread and get a side of mustard), hot smoked turkey sandwich..yummm! And the tuna salad (with an extra hard boiled egg) and the corner chopped salad (with extra turkey) is amazing (I like extra protein I guess). Oh and might I add, their milkshakes are creamy and delicious!When you're all done, you're in a great place to walk it off :)~~#~1
I lost all interest in going here after a big cockroach crawled across our table a little before the nachos were delivered. And yes, we still ate after seeing that. I left traumatized.~~#~0
Sad to say it's been WAAAAYY too long since I"ve been here. A buddy from back at home (Seatle) was craving some spicy Korean pork so we all went here for dinner last night. I'm ALWAYS a fan of Korean BBQ, and this place does not disappoint. We ordered the Kalbi, marinated short ribs. We also went with the Spicy Pork in Red Pepper Paste (Dwaeji Bul Gogi, it's not as spicy as it sounds but very good). The last meat dish we ordered marinated chicken, Dalk Gui. We started with an order of the potstickers and they serve this killer lightly dressed salad with a touch of white vinegar, sesame oil and salt and pepper. In typical Korean BBQ, the bring out an array of small side dishes to complement your BBQ. Some are spicy (different types of kimchee), some are salty, some are hot (last night, one dish they had was this awesome tofu that had to have been cooked on the flat top) served with this good sauce, boiled eggs in soy sauce and a sesame sprout salad. This is one of my favorite parts of the experience, you get all these cool little side dishes to eat with your rice and BBQ. On to my favorite reason to come to Korean BBQ. There's a grill in the middle of your table and a hood above your table. They bring out your meat already marinated, and you just grill it up as you like it and as you're hungry. The marinades are out of this world and the food is simply great.  Now that's just an option, you can have the cook it up on your table or in the back in your a weenie. Overall, for 4 of us the tab was around 115, but that was for 3 meat dishes, an appetizer, all the sides, rice, few big bottles of OB Korean Beer and two small sakes. If you're looking for something new and a tad bit adventurous, this is it~~#~1
It has everything!~~#~1
Shame on Zipps for opposing a new Z Tejas at Bethany Home and 16th St,  Afraid of a little competition.~~#~0
Oh holy crap, The Pop Shop is so friggin' awesome. They have so many different types of soda here. Today I picked up a Chai cola, some amaretto soda, limoncello flavored soda, a bunch of ginger beer and root beer, a few classic grape sodas, and a maple creme soda. So delicious! Then I went home and played Mario Galaxy 2 on the Wii. I felt like Tom Hanks in Big. They have Dublin Dr. Pepper, which is so, so good. It's kind of sad that so many soda companies just release cheap, yucky versions of their products for general consumers and you have to go to some out-of-the-way place to get the version that actually tastes good. If you go to The Pop Shop and get a Coke in a glass bottle with real cane sugar you'll realize that Coke actually tastes really, really good. The Dublin Dr. Pepper is so delicious that you can actually tell why Dr. Pepper caught on in the first place.They're closed on Sundays, though.~~#~1
It hits the spot every single time. I love that I can always expect my food to be hot. Menu is simple and  there's a secret not so secret menu, which is not complicated just not on the board. Is a must for all of my East Coast friends to go to In-N-Out when they visit. Usually when they step out of the plane:)~~#~1
I know this place is overrated crap. I have tried 3 times to eat here but just cannot wait that long for a fucking pizza. I seriously doubt it is worth the wait. Even when it was DEAD, it was still 45 min. FUCK YOU! I have had great pizza in my life, in NY, SF, CHICAGO, LA and San Diego. Hell there is even good pizza in Phx. Why this place gets all the love is beyond me. The staff is snotty too. I have no desire to eat here, ever! The pizza looked OK while I was waiting. But Pizza is simple, if you know what your doing you can make as good or better than this joint....hint: Grazie's !!! No wait. FUCK this joint. they can suck it. I refuse to be a loser waiting 1,2-4 hours for a fucking pizza! Just stupid!!!~~#~0
The best freaking tortilla I have ever had in my life, hands down!  Yes, I'm a ****bertos addict and just when I didn't think it couldn't get any better it did!!!  I just got back from Mexico and this is still the best burrito I have EVER HAD.  Adobada ROCKS!  I have seriously eaten at almost every dive mexican joint in the Phoenix area and will go out of my way to eat here from now on.  Great drive through service and the LARGE size red AND green sauces are the bomb!!!~~#~1
Beautiful architecture, great selection, great art, librarians are very nice.~~#~1
Very friendly and helpful. Not afraid of working with vintage glasses, which is all I wear.  Thank you!~~#~1
Awesome chocolate shakes!!!~~#~1
This Lenny's location is horrible. The fries appeared to have been sitting in old grease or just old. I asked if they were fresh and she indicated yes.  They were horrible. Will never eat at 5713 w. Glendale location again.  They are NOT like the other locations.. Please mark my words. They don't even deserve 1 star.  They didn't even get order correct to begin with. Had to return burger.~~#~0
was not very impressed with our visit with one of the doctors at this clinic. the front desk staff was friendly and welcoming but our experience with the doctor wasn't great. she didn't introduce herself when she came into the exam room and didn't ask my name, no handshake, nothing. it seemed that she guessed at a diagnosis for our dog's injury. didn't seem too interested in finding the REAL problem. she suggested very pricey treatment for the guessed diagnosis. went to a different vet today for a second opinion and the exam was much more thorough. MUCH more thorough. the diagnosis today was completely different than the diagnosis given from Desert Hills and it wasn't a guess. the vet i went to for the second opinion spent enough time with my dog to make a proper diagnosis. he also found a problem with my dog's hind leg - which was examined by the Desert Hills Doctor who didn't mention any problem. wouldn't recommend this place.~~#~0
Good place -- always familiar faces. Gets a little hectic for Football and UFC events, but otherwise is always a good time. The bartenders are cool people and always quick with joke. Good prices, strong drinks, great staff.~~#~1
I absolutely love coming here! Especially with Jo or Josefine :) she is awesome. She does a great job and knows what you are talking about when explaining to her how you want your hair. She actually cares about her clients and keeps up with you she just doesn't get your money and forget about you! I got hair extensions put in for the first time, she taught me how to take care of them and text me to see how I was doing. She is a great hairstylist and a fantastic gal. Here's her cell (623)698-4530 :)~~#~1
This is a great place to play slots. I love going there. It is just like a Vegas Casino. The employees are wonderful. I frequent the high roller room and it the best I have been to.I went there today and yahoo. I have to go check out talking stick next.~~#~1
Melinda knows what she is talking about when she discusses how to train my maniac of a dog. I've received her help many times about issues with my hyper active canine and she's quick to give me tips that I can easily do and they have always worked. She loves the animals she works with and gives them specific training instructions to their own needs. Keep it up Melinda!~~#~1
So sad I have to give this local establishment 1 star; but after 3 attempts to enjoy a meal there, I JUST CAN'T DO IT CAPTAIN! We arrived for a late lunch at 3:30pm and were pleasantly surprised at Happy Hour in the middle of the day! First off...it smells like you just walked into the men's room in mexico, when you first enter from the Central Avenue entrance; then it lingers making its way to the bar, thinning out with each step, until you get to a point where you just get used to it arriving at the bar. My sister wanted to leave immediately but it was the only place big enough downtown Phoenix to bring my bike inside, so we toughed it out-again. I torture myself only because I really want to give the downtown establishments a chance!However the food killed it for me this time. We ordered appetizers for 3. The homemade salsa with chips and a side of sour cream shouldn't be that hard to do. They won me half way with this because turns out the chips are homemade-and delicious! but the salsa is pace picante. If i'd a known that I would have ordered something else. The potato skins came out looking as if they were made previously, then left sitting around for 5 hours, then re-cooked bacon and all! They were dry and crumbly as heck and the ranch dressing was straight out of the bottle (the horribly tasting one). The Salad was ok, but the ranch made it worse.My  friend who was visiting from Texas enjoyed her French Toast, so therein lies the 1 star=breakfast at lunch time yay. It looked okay. Nothing to rave about though.Since it had been almost 2 years since we all seen each other=a shot was in order! 3 raspberry kamikazi's please.....What? You don't know how to make a Rasp Kami? What a waste of a full bar. Luckily I knew the ingredients and the measurements; but funny thing is the bartender, who said she didn't know how to make the drink, kept insisting there was soda water. Even after explaining the recipe she added soda water=WTF?I have seen crowds waiting to see the Murder Mystery Theater productions held there, but i'm not sure if I could stand the smell that long! I have to regrettably say this will be my last attempt @_@~~#~0
I have yet to step foot in this place, however I don't need to in order to rate it. A friend of mine said, "I am coming up from Tucson and Rudy's is on the way to your house I am bringing breakfast." OK, well I'm game for anything. He brought the breakfast tacos. First its more like a breakfast burrito its big for a taco. Secondly, it was utterly amazing. Apparently they take the left over brisket and trimmings from the night before, marinate it in BBQ sauce and BAM that's the breakfast taco ingredients. I have been craving another one ever since Friday morning when I had mine.I cannot wait to go try Rudy's for dinner. I have tried Bobby Q's, Famous Daves, Dickey's, and Brian's up in Cave Creek, this was BY FAR the best I have had in the valley!! Highly recommended!~~#~1
Had such a wonderful dinner here. Boyfriend and I came here for dinner before heading out to the Cine Capri the day the new James Bond movie came out. It was a perfect evening to sit outside. The patio is great for people watching, although my boyfriend had a better time checking out all the sports cars that drove by. Eric was our server and he was phenomenal. We made sure to talk to the manager before we left and we had made reservations thru Open Table and also raved about him there and sent an e-mail. My boyfriend is pretty picky so we chose the melted tomato, basil, and warm ricotta bruchetta to start . It came with 4 pieces and we devoured them in minutes. It was yummy. We also had the bread with the sun-dried tomato butter, which was also good. For dinner he had the pasta bolognese and I had the osso buco. Both were very generous servings. His was good, but I'm not sure what it was, I think fennel, was a bit overpowering. The osso buco was sooooo good. The meat and polenta melt in your mouth. I was in heaven. Could not have made a better selection. I can't wait to come back here and bring my family for my birthday next month. Our waiter suggested a nice red wine with our meal with was a perfect compliment, but I can't remember what it was called. Oh, well. We never felt rushed during our meal even though we did take our time for a Friday night. I'm definitely coming back!~~#~1
They don't just have great burgers.. I love the chicken sliders-mmmYum! But  what really has me yelping is the sign I read that said Pets Welcome :))) next time I go to the BluBurger, my beagle MaddyMay is going too!~~#~1
Lets make this simple - If you can mess up a simple banana milk shake (something even I, he who burns water, can make) you deserve no stars. And since yelp is kind enough to you and wont let me do that, let me give you whats next. Your saving grace, the lady at the counter was sweet and tried to do her best.~~#~0
I was here recently with a few of my friends. Beware: It can be difficult to find this place, as it's a bit hidden away from the main street. Fortunately, one of my friends knew exactly where he was going.This place is a tiny store with no indoor seating. You go in, there's a menu and a glass case full of their (changed daily!) food selection, and you order and pay right there. Water is in a dispenser in the front, and they have glasses for you to serve yourself. At the end of your meal, you just quickly bus your own plates.In terms of service, the ladies working here are great! They're friendly, helpful, conversational, and very generous with the samples. Any questions, feel free to ask them and be enlightened!For food, most of my friends got wraps (custom and the wrap of the day), whereas I had just eaten, so I settled for a small hummus plate with pita bread. Despite being a small, I still got what I thought was a big serving for a very good price (around $5). Extremely good, and I liked their selection of hummus!In general, if you're in the Tempe area and are craving some healthy vegan food, make the effort to find Desert Roots. I definitely want to make a return trip already.~~#~1
Love this place! I've searched out good BBQ in Phoenix and I have finally found a great "lunch spot." I've also had the catering a couple times and it is also great. Good prices, the line (every day at lunch!) moves fast... and you can eat outside almost every day. I always get the Brisket Sandwich "meal" but my friends tell me the Pulled Pork is better... I guess it's all good!~~#~1
Chompies is consistently good. I was there for breakfast again this morning and my omelet was perfect! So were the potatoes...and the bagel...of course. Good stuff! We were greeted and seated quickly and our waitress was great too. It was my friend's first time there and she took the time to explain their expansive menu and offer up a couple of her favorites. And I picked up some babka to go. Their bakery, deli and bread displays are huge! I've never been disappointed with Chompies.~~#~1
Service was great, food was awesome!  Yelp is right.  Definitely try the pork belly pastrami ($12) and the Citizen chopped salad ($12).  The pan-seared scallops were also winners ($24).The cask cocktails are also amazing. So smooth.  The Manhattan ($11) was amazing.  The flavors definitely mellowed in the cask and gave it a unique flavor as well.And don't miss the bread pudding!  Yum! $10 and worth every penny!Plus one of the only places in downtown Scottsdale that's open past 10pm.  Score!~~#~1
I read the reviews and met Jim and must agree that he IS the reason the rink is open and surviving- One heck of a nice guy and pasionate about the rink...must be a throw back to canada, eh?  It's not the newest most beautiful rink in town but the one I prefer to skate at. If you ahve not checked it out you should do so~~#~1
This is the hole-in-the-wall Mexican against which I judge all others.  This is a frequent lunch spot for me, for $.99 street tacos, gorditas, burritos and the occasional torta (not as good as Tortas El Guero, but good).  Mmm...mole.  Theirs is excellent (chicken, shredded beef, and cheese are the choices for enchiladas).  Forget the tostada, order a sope, with the thick masa "tortilla", topped with chicken or pork al pastor.  If you get a street taco, I highly recommend the beef cabeza - it melts in your mouth like short ribs.  And it's dirt cheap.  We had dinner there tonight, ordered a Pacifico, shredded beef mole enchiladas, a sope, three street tacos and some chips and salsa to go and were $18 lighter (before tip).  No fancy tequilas or margaritas, just great food.~~#~1

I had purchased the Groupon for the Phoenix location as a treat for my birthday trip to Arizona. I had heard great things about the experience so I was very much looking forward to treating myself! However, when I called to make an appointment, the call center staff was rude and impatient once I informed them I had a Groupon. They told me I was unable to use it during the one day I had available in town. When I asked if it was possible to make any sort of arrangement, she cut me off and told me no and that if she even tried she would get in trouble. She then asked me if I wanted to book the appointment and pay for it without the Groupon--I understand her wanting to try to "make the sale", but I felt it somewhat inappropriate to ask someone who has already paid for a voucher ($20) to make an appointment with a payment of another $45 plus tip. Needless to say, the guest service is severely lacking and I don't know that I'd be willing to give DryBar another chance.~~#~0
Pomeroy's is, by far, my favorite bar! Now, this is not the place to go if you want to get dressed up and go somewhere swanky or go dancing or anything like that. And don't bring friends that are too cool for dive bars either. Pom's is where you go if you want to wear your jeans and drink for cheap and rock out to the jukebox. Most of the bartenders have been there since I've started going and remembered my drink the second or third time I went in, gotta love that! There are a lot of regulars and is usually pretty low key and chill, but it can also get pretty packed on Saturday nights. They have four pool tables and shuffle board, too. They have a pretty wide selection of beers, most of them on tap. My personal fav is Blue Moon but I once had a  friend get incredibly excited to see they have Mirror Pond and another friend get equally happy over PBR, ha! Oh, and their food... yum! I mean, it's definitely bar food (fried goodies, sammies, burgers, etc.) but I will say that their club sandwich is just amazing. I know, most food is delicious late at night at the bar... but, for real. It's good!  Also, the bartenders have cooked up food for my friends and I on more than one occasion after the kitched was closed. Love me some Pomeroy's!~~#~1
coffee is great! very friendly staf and great place to relax and drink a cup of coffee :-)~~#~1
Love this place! I have been going here for years. I have perfected the "smash".  They have lots of new options. Everything is always fresh and tastey.  The lines go very quickly and the management and staff are always so pleasant.~~#~1
The best delivery pizza we have ever had.  We ordered the Italian Beef pizza and the Cubs (traditional combo) pizza.  We were going to go to a local favorite that we also love.  We have to go to the other place to pick up the pizza and it is always crowded.  I liked this pizza flavor better than the "O"ther place but the crust may be just a little more doughy at this place and not as crispy but still good and thin.  Then since this was a first time try, we decided to add 6 wings.  We ordered hot and well done as someone else said to get them done crispier.  We travel a lot and many nights we would prefer to stay in and now we finally found a GREAT pizza delivery place.  Can't wait to try more stuff from here, really curious about the spinach artichoke garlic pizza as once in a while I like a weird pizza.~~#~1
I'm a sucker for Chicago food from back home but out here in the valley, and Higley Hot Dog has been there for a while providing authentic Vienna Beef Hot Dogs since I went to ASU east campus.Very home town feel, the older couple that owns/runs it are always very nice and happy and having a good time.  And the lunch line there gets long and out the door cause it's so good :)Notes:  Not open on Sundays... and CASH only!The MAP on yelp is/was wrong... here's the correct business profile link on Google Maps - http://is.gd/fn6UThey have some good press already as well:http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/story/123004http://www.insiderpages.com/b/3657327340~~#~1
Always get delicious deli food here.  Subs are excellent, lots to choose from, and fast & friendly service.  The is very affordable too.  My favorite sub here is the Italian Cruz Po' Boy.  It is not on the menu anymore, it was on there old menu, but is still available. =)~~#~1
Hands down best drinks in the valley.~~#~1
Why did I have such a good time here, again? Was it because I was with the best of company & just couldn't go wrong? Vig sure does make my date nights go well though, I'll say that much.Friday after 11. I wore black flats, not my checkered vans. The door guy didn't say squat about liking my shoes. So I'm pretty sure he doesn't say that to all the girls. That made me like him even more. I think he genuinely likes my vans.Hmm not always easy to find a seat. The host is gone & it's "seat yourself".Made it to the back bar. Got a couple drinks. I was being leered at by 2 guys pushing 60. Uncomfortable, so we moved.We got a table & 2 different servers asked us if we'd been helped. We moved tables. No server. We sat in some chairs. No server. Meh...Also, Meow-meow might be preggers. She looked a little on the fat side.~~#~1
it has been said already-Awesomeness~~#~1
Are you looking for a reputable, honest AC company?  Look no further than Hays.  Excellent service, honest technicians and an owner who cares about his customers.   When we realized it was time to replace our unit we got 4 quotes.  Hays quote was competitive and their labor and parts backed up by a warranty.  Chris (the owner) took his time measuring our home and answering our many questions.  Install was quick, painless and on time.  Not only did Chris follow up, but we received a thank you card a few days later.I've recommended Hays to many friends and family without hesitation.  More companies should conduct business like Hays does.~~#~1
I love the ambience, food and the service.  Best steak house bar none! I've traveled around the world and this restaurant tops all....~~#~1
Located on the southwest corner of Broadway and Lindsey in Mesa, this little mom and pop diner is the perfect breakfast place.  Its SUPER cheap and quick and the people are always welcoming and friendly.  My favorite is the "giant breakfast" with eggs, hashbrowns and your choice of meat and toast.  I've had lunch here too, the burgers yes, are giant, and delicious.~~#~1
I've been wanting to try this place for awhile and we finally did last weekend. We will definitely be back soon!I got eggs cooked over-medium, potatoes, bacon and toast. All was delish and their coffee was great too. My fiance got pancakes along with some other things and they tasted good too!A great place to go when you want a diner atmosphere. The place is pretty big too, so if there's a wait, you probably won't have to wait long.Oh and the service was spot on!~~#~1
Big ass hamburger + cream cheese + jalapenos + fried onion strings = was like oral sex for fatties.. and I enjoyed every provocative second of it. Their Kilt Lifter was a brilliant, boozy concoction that sits on the tongue, dark and heavy like a dirty secret. My gal had the Raj IPA and it had the kind of curious sparkle to turn my eh-ness regarding IPAs to hell-yeahness. I absolutely regret coming here. All my local breweries are utterly inferior compared to this surprising find.~~#~1
This is such a beautiful park! I won't reiterate the amenities most of the other reviews have pointed out, but the rec center is really clean and there's a lot of activities inside as well. I have yet to take advantage of their trails and picnic areas, though I will definitely make it a point to do so!~~#~1
I came here a few days ago with the wife. We had gone to them when they were in Buckeye and it WAS awesome. Our experience this time was less than stellar.  The dough tasted like play-dough....salty as hell, undercooked and kinda slimy/sludgy in the middle.The toppings (wife had cinnamon and I had green chili chicken) and the mild salsa were the only reasons I could eat a few bites. I ended up scraping it off and throwing out the fry bread. The price was about avg but still not worth the taste. I dont think we will try it again. Sad day.~~#~0
I love eating here- although i'd eventually like to try the entire menu, my mouth waters so badly at a few items I can't do without! You order at the counter then get a number, and your food is brought out to you in real dishes. My favorites:Luau Pork- decent portion of meat served over rice (I suggest the rumbi coconut/red bean rice) with some creamy macaroni salad. I don't care for the sauce it comes with by default, but instead I ask for the Orange Chicken Sauce. Kahuna burger- a perfectly cooked explosion of delicious! It has two thin beef patties, swiss cheese, and pineapple. The combination of things, along with some mayo and a sweet squishy bun, is incredibly addictive. It comes with some sauce but i've never used it..better yet, it comes with:RUMBI FRIES: A tasty mix of regular fries and seasoned sweet potato fries. One time they even let me have all sweet potato fries, now THAT made me a happy customer. :) They come with a sauce that i'm pretty sure is just ketchup and mayo mixed together. I hardly ever eat fries but can't get enough of these.Key Lime Pie: It's very limey, you get a large slice. Perhaps not top notch, but better than what you can easily find in the area.I've never tried the entree salads, but once asked for a side caesar that was fairly large and did not disappoint. I've also had the brown rice but prefer the mix of the rumbi rice. If you check your junk mail, they send out coupons quite often. Rumbi is fantastic for a quick casual meal or take out!~~#~1
This place is just plain nasty. I tried it once and it was so bad that I took a couple bites and threw it out. Fast forward a year or so- I was in the hood, in a hurry for lunch and craving Japanese but needed something quick so thought I would give it another try. Nope, bad idea. Got it to go, went back to the office, took a bite and in the trash it went again. I lived in Japan for years and travel there frequently still. I don't expect this to be up to the standards of what I could get there but I've had school cafeteria Japanese food that certainly beat this.~~#~0
Was it the scene, the huge martini, or the company of friends?  Not sure and don't care, I love this place.  Sit outside at a table or at the bar, service was amazing and the night had a hint of cool about it.  I will return.~~#~1
This is Vietnamese food for North Scottsdale white folks who have never had Vietnamese food before.It's a fast food style place that gives you food with very little flavor and tells you to start adding sriracha and oyster sauce util it starts to taste good.Really really bad.~~#~0
I love this place..ok only been here once, but the experience was fabulous and can't wait to go again!It was girls dinner out - five of us gals on a Saturday night - we had reservations and were seated close to our time.  It was a stormy night and they had to close the outside patio, so they were really slammed with diners.One gal ordered the grilled artichoke appetizer and it was so delish!  I will definetly order this next time.   For my main dish I had the Dancing Crab Cakes and Holy Crab!  There was no filler - all yummy crab - served with a plain tarter sauce which they didn't need, so wasn't too sad it didn't have a creative dipping sauce.     I was so into my dish - I don't even remember what everyone else had.   The best part was the dessert - only two of us were having dessert and on the top of the dessert menu - it says "desserts for two" - well....we still ordered two of them to share!   White chocolate banana cream pie was my choice and it really had an amazing flavor, but the dessert you must have is the French white chocolate bread pudding - wow - wow - wow!   I am not a big fan of bread puddings, but this is made with croissants and is not your typical bread pudding.  it melts in your mouth with white chocolate godiva liquer, caramel sauce, and golden raisens.   You must save room for dessert!My only complaint is that the restaurant is so loud - it was really hard to carry a conversation with your table - it also is a bit dark which is great for a romantic couple dinner, but not the best for a gals night out.oh, just remembered - get the side dish of the honey roasted carrots - that is like a dessert in itself!~~#~1
Hmmmmm, interesting...Evolution and growth?It seems apropos that I was to meet up with fellow Yelpers Lauren V. and Mr. K (aka Omar K.) for a couple drinks on a late Friday afternoon.  This was my first trip back to PHX in roughly three years and was doing a bizarre "visit old friends/places and see new friends/places" kind of trip.  So, with that in mind, Lauren V. and I had been discussing various HH spots and places we liked which the original Postino's was mentioned as a place we both love.  I wasn't sure if I wanted to continue with revisiting the past or do something new...so after much hemming and hawing on my part she made an executive decision to meet up at the new location.  Her choice was perfect in so many ways.Shortly before HH, I looked at the map provided in the B'berry Yelp App and asked my friend Lindra F. If this was near Katz Deli....a sad look was returned and it was explained this IS where Katz Deli was...maaaan, really?  An old Phoenix institution gone?  For a wine bar?  Shit...I was bummed and had a chip on my shoulder coming in...which by the end of the night...dissolved.The remodeled space is a throw back to the Palm Spring-ish modernism of chunky stone and floor to ceiling large pane windows.  Flat lines and clean angles characterize the place but there are enough accents to make the whole place feel seriously intimate.  Basically, the feel is ultra-cool lounge of the late-50's and early 60's.  I like this.  I don't like this everywhere...but I like this here.  It's something of an homage to older Phoenix, and to me, the idea that it replaced Katz (which was born in that era) shows a huge sign of respect and knowledge of the underlying culture of an area.  The quality of the space is top notch as is their understanding of sense of place.Lastly, on the topic of design, the outside patio and the bar servicing it offer great Western views for sunsets.  However, those inside are not robbed of any views either.   The layout offers those with both the same view the patio has (over the bar) and stunning Eastern views as well (saw a great lightning storm on my visit).The wines-well...fantastic of course.  Living now in San Francisco I can say that Postino's can enter into any upper echelon of San Francisco wine bars.  The servers know their stuff and the beers are great too....Anchor Steam Celebration Ale on tap every Winter makes me ridiculously happy and impressed.The grub...just like the original..fantastic.  You can rarely go wrong with anything on the menu.Postino's offers the prime place to have some quality wine and grub while chatting it up with new or old friends.  If I lived nearby I'd be here at least once a week....which leads me to the dissolving of that aforementioned chip on my shoulder.  I was getting tired of the pervasive thought in the Valley of just demolishing the past and throwing something new in its place for the sake of something new.  I was very worried about that here...especially in almost hallowed ground of Katz Deli.  However, what I came to find is a well planned slow growth of a high quality establishment who designed the space as an homage to the past but showed a enticing view of some of Phoenix's future.Thanks to Lauren V. for the rec...you were spot on.~~#~1
Worst burritos I've ever had, not only was the service slow but the burrito had small ingredients mixed in that weren't even supposed to be there. I got a California burrito, asked for guacamole, which they did not include and tucked into the fold of the awful tortilla was fried egg...what the hell are these people doing?The whole thing was a runny mess of beans and almost no other ingredients. The cashier was extremely rude, the meat was sub-par and I'm pretty sure the chips were radioactive. All in all, I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone and if you're saying this is the best Mexican place you clearly haven't been anywhere other than Del Taco or some other crap fast food chain.~~#~0
This place is truly one of a kind. After seeing positive reviews on yelp, I took my classic mustang here to have a small area repainted. They not only quoted me a reasonable rate, but found a way to save me money by using a method requiring no new additional paint to be added.After less than one day, Bob the paint guy had the car done with amazing results, Chase had the car washed down and looking great and all for half of my original quote. Exclusive will be the only shop I ever use in the future for paint or body work.~~#~1
Is there a NO STAR rating?  30 minutes, 20 dollars, car came out clean on the outside, just as dirty on the inside.  When I asked them to clean the inside since I paid for it, they did it pathetically again.  I just went home and cleaned it myself.  I also enjoyed the guy's swastika tat, great place for the kids.~~#~0
I'm a transplanted Texas girl from Austin. I was craving a taste of home and saw reviews for this place. The atmosphere is great, the waitress was amusingly surly. Sadly the food was terrible. I don't understand actually having a disclaimer on your menu that you don't season your meat?! However that would explain the ridiculous amount of condiments at the table. I ordered the chicken fried steak and was saaaaaadddly disappointed. It is NOT authentic to not season this dish. It literally tasted like a cube steak dipped in a flour/water paste then deep fried. No self-respecting Texan would do this, and you certainly wouldn't add pepporcini pepper sauce or Cholula sauce to a real CFS!  The meat was not the only thing unseasoned, the chicken tenders, potatoes, biscuits and pretty much everything else was tasteless and so bad I couldn't eat it and I LOOOOVE anything fried, so this is pretty bad. We actually felt kind of bad for them when they saw how much food was on the table and we didn't want a take home box.   I advise they add salt & pepper at the least.~~#~0
worst customer service and the manager was not so friendly. It used to be better when Boca7 was opened back then.~~#~0
Damn good gelato.  the best I've ever had and its 1/3rd the fat of normal gelato...don't know how they do it, but it absolutely ROCKS!!!  Love this place and the staff is the absolute BEST and FRIENDLIEST.  the other restaurants nearby should send their wait staff over to Frost for lessons in Customer Service.~~#~1
I definitely recommend this Place! Great food, great service and awesome price. Paid less than $150 for 6 people and we got the yelp discount. My father and fiance both got the  Ribeye and the rest of us ordered their Sunday Meal Deals, which was so much food. I loved their cornbread and their roasted corn side dish is a must try item.  I will go back next time in phoenix!~~#~1
Excellent menu - servers are super friendly - great for kids!  What more can you ask for... oh yeah, the food is awesome, too!~~#~1
I find the apology from the owner, a little different than the e-mail he actually sent me on march 5th.I'll let you decide...Hi Teddy,rick s. has sent you a message on Yelp:Your Review"Teddy I do appreciate your feedback, however there are 3 sides to every story yours, ours, and the truth..Yoli explained the situation to me as it escalated after she came out to talk to you and your friend.. I do agree that our server was inappropriate with the comment she made referring to you and your friend being Loud and Making a Scene in Public, nothing to do with being gay, how would she even know? Yoli says that your friend repeatedly told her you waited 10 mins not 15..Maybe the wait was to long for your taste since you were really hungry. It was a beautiful morning and enjoying the patio and the beautiful garden it what people do. Possibly taking the other tables order was an oversight, You stated that since you waited to long you were going to leave and not pay your bill for the coffee, that Teddy is theft and you would never do that if you where in a store and the line was too long so you just walk out with a drink, right? The server more than wanted to accommodate you after you made a fuss, including my wife. Regardless if there were 3 tables or 30 tables full, learn to have patience. Yoli was busy in the kitchen helping make 2 large to-go orders, many things you don't know happen in a restaurant. We both have Family and Friends that are part of the LGBT community and we nor our employees would ever discriminate against anyone. The whole new level of 2nd class citizen was really Amplified by your friend calling my wife a Wetback which you failed to mention in your review. He should be ashamed of his actions. We care about and even love our customers which you could still be, as we invite you and your friend back for breakfast or lunch and we both can make some apologies and have a better day. Please respond when you have had time to read this and maybe cool off. Thanks Rick and Yoli"~~#~0
I LOVE Events by First Rose and have been a satisifed customer for over 15 years. I have done 3 weddings with them and lots of other special occassions. My daughter just got married and Andrea did the flowers. My daughter cried when she saw her beautiful bouquet. Everything was better than I hoped for. When I sat down with Andrea I asked her for her recommendations because she is the expert. I'm sorry if others had bad experiences but I never have. Trust their judgement and you will get quality work, beautiful flowers and a good rate. I wouldn't go anywhere else.~~#~1
Great place for a quick quality meal.  I've had their salads, pizza and subs and they're all really good.  They have their own "Bad Donkey Sauce" that's oil with seasonings.  It's delish!~~#~1
Amazing food, great staff, great environment. First you must understand that I don't like Italian food, nor am I a huge pizza fan, in my world Papa John's is good.But I went to take my son, and because my best friend said it was great. When we got their the place was packed but no wait. (By the time we left they were lining up at the door)  As soon as we sat down our server got our drink order, and finding out it was out first time gave us some history of the place. I really enjoyed that.We started off with their cheesy garlic bread with sauce on the side. My son who states hates garlic bread loved this, even stating he'd come back here just for that.We followed up with each of is getting a personal pizza, mine was their "Get Meaty", my son had a pepperoni & pineapple, both on their version of thin crust. For the personal ones, to me this seems like standard hand tossed crust and it was divine.We each ate half and brought the rest home. Totally stuffed!  With our two drinks, he a soda, me a tea, our bill was just over 20 bucks. Well worth it in my mind. Our glasses were never empty, never did plates lay around on our table but we also never felt rushed or bothered.My new favorite place to eat near my house, as we walked out I got a glance at the pasta dished, I think they might be next on my list to try.Another bonus, they not only have take out, they deliver!~~#~1
Dr. Wood is an amazing dentist. He is friendly, knowledgeable and cares about his patients. He never makes me feel rushed when I am asking questions and he makes me feel at ease in the chair. I have never felt pushed into making any hasty decisions on major dental work. His staff is just amazing as well. Everyone is friendly and they greet you by name. When they gave me a referral for an orthodontist, they provided me with all information that I needed and also offered to send any information over to save me time. Liz, the dental hygienist, has always done my cleanings and she is such a genuinely sweet person. She always takes her time and I feel great when she has completed the cleaning. The exam rooms and front office are clean and modern. I feel very relaxed when I am in the office, either waiting or sitting in the chair. All machinery is never outdated or worn. I tell everyone how great Dr. Wood and his staff are all the time!~~#~1
I could literally spend an entire day at this 99cents only store. It's clean. They play awesome music. They have pretty much everything and anything your heart desires. Even produce. Yes, I said produce!!Seriously, I have been to dollar stores a million times, even other 99 cents only, and I really think this is the best dollar store I have ever been to!!Party supplies, health and beauty items, spices, dry food, frozen food, produce, house cleaners, plates, cups, candles, books, pool toys, candy, cooking instruments, Tupperware, bottled water, diet pills, q-tips, painting supplies, school supplies, batteries... the list goes on and on, and nothing is more than 99 cents.I would highly recommend hitting the 99 cents only store up prior to Walmart or the grocery store because you can save yourself a ton of loot, and honestly, the products are the same quality because they come from overstock and are actually the same products (most of the time). I know the idea of produce from the dollar store sounds crazy, but its been really good and fresh!!It's also a cheap way to waste away an afternoon with free A/C!!~~#~1
I brought my last cat Marty here for his neutering & regular shots until he died in a tragic accident some time ago.  Yesterday I came in & found my lovely new kitty I call Abby.  It has always been a pleasure to work with the staff members here.  They're just full of love for the animals & provide an excellent service in offering them up to responsible new homes & providing low cost pet health care afterwards.  The shelter is clean, the animals properly fed & cared for while they're here, & I think these gals & guys deserve another 5 Star Yelp review, so here it is!     :-))PS:  They have many precious cats here (near 100?) to choose from, who need loving homes.  They're all spayed/neutered (if old enough), caught up on their shots, & available at no cost now.  (Donate what you can!)  YOU could make a special difference for both your new pet & the Humane Society by adopting right now while they're VERY full here!     :-))~~#~1
I came to Phoenix on business, I live in NY where there is truly great dinning and I have to say that Bobby Q's is the best BBQ I have ever had. I had the baby back ribs - which could be eaten with a knife and fork, but the BBQ sauce was so good, I had to clean the bones - they were amazing, the corn bread AMAZING!! Lindsay was our server and she was fantastic. So incredibly good, anytime I am in Phoenix I will def go to Bobby Q's. I am not leaving for a few days and intend on eating there one more time before I leave. Yum!! We also got 10% off our bill for saying yelp!! It would be worth double the price of what we paid without discount!!!~~#~1
Awesome. Duane is so friendly and explains everything he's going to do. There were no surprises and everything was done right. I had him completely remodel our master bath, the guest bath, and rip off the counter tops in the kitchen. He charged what he estimated it would cost, even though there were a couple of little extra things he ended up having to do. We're having him back to install our laminate flooring in a couple of weeks. I'll never need another handyman!~~#~1
By far the best Mexican food place around! I have been going to Valle Luna since I was a kid and the food is always up to par. You know what you are getting when you go. Sometimes the service can be streaky but overall one of the better places to go. Last time i tried their Cheese crisp extraordinaire. It was freaking amazing. I love when you pile steak, bell peppers, cream cheese, onions, and more into a cheese crisp.~~#~1

It was my absolute pleasure to be invited as a guest to a client's holiday party at La Hacienda by Richard Sandoval, which is a AAA Four-Diamond-winning restaurant located on the property of the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess Resort.  Everything was just lovely including the location, the service and most of all - the food!The building itself is built and decorated in a rustic Spanish Mission style, and they've spared no expense with the décor.  You enter through large wooden & glass doors flanked by outdoor seating areas with beautiful gas lamp & glass pebbled fire pits and many free-standing, modern brushed metal gas heaters with dramatic flames shooting up the center glass tubes.  Impressive to say the least until you pass through the doors into the foyer directly in front of  a very modern and visually compelling backlit bar stocked with an impressive collection of high-end tequilas and spirits.  La Hacienda is renowned for its tequila offerings and knowledgeable staff which can recommend any number of fine distilled spirits based on your tastes.  The foyer is bedecked with a massive wrought iron chandelier and flanked by dining areas to the left and the right.Our party was hosted in a cozy private dining area featuring beautiful French doors and a working fireplace crackling with fragrant, seasoned wood that set the scene for a sophisticated, yet fun dinner with about 30 + people.  The servers were prompt in taking our drink orders and several people at my table got delicious prickly pear margaritas that looked (and apparently tasted - I did not sample them), phenomenal.   Once all the guests arrived we were treated to a magnificent buffet-style dinner that absolutely blew my socks off!  The buffet line itself consisted of over three tables of the best authentic Mexican foods I've ever had.  One table alone was stocked to the gills with homemade salsas tomato and tomatillo of every imaginable kind, pickled onions, vegetable escabeche, shredded Cotija cheese and REAL crema.The buffet featured authentic quesadillas, enchilada casserole, Mexican rice, epazote-scented black beans, encrusted beef tenderloin, grilled fish, baked clams Veracruzana and my three favorite things that I've been craving for days since the party; an unparalleled mole poblano, a savory shrimp in chipotle-chili sauce exploding with plump, fresh king-sized prawns and an honest-to-God, roast suckling pig!  The mole was the best I've ever had in my life with large pieces of white meat chicken breast, grilled plantains and topped with sesame seeds.  The shrimp chipotle-chili sauce dish was outstanding; the prawns were HUGE and fresh in a light, creamy broth with fresh herbs and spices.  Much to-do was made of the presentation of, and subsequent carving and consumption of the roast suckling pig.  It was carried through the dining room, past the guests, fresh from the kitchen by two chefs proudly holding either end of the huge roasting platter upon which the tasty piggy laid.  Not for the faint of heart, vegetarians or those who prefer not to know where their food comes from - the piglet was roasted whole, about 3 feet long feet to snout, and its roasted crackling skin was sliced open to offer up its delicious, perfectly-seasoned flesh for the eating.  I sampled just about everything on buffet but seriously had no room for seconds. I saved the last ounce of stomach space for a serving for fresh, hot cinnamon churros accompanied by dishes of fresh caramel and cream.  Sheer delight!All in all it was a wonderful evening that I'm certain was thoroughly enjoyed by all.  My only regret is that I had to say goodbye to that delicious buffet line lovingly prepared and served by La Hacienda staff. Next time I'm invited to "La Ha" I'm lining my purse with aluminum foil and bringing ziplock baggies to abscond with leftovers!~~#~1
Bikini is everything I could ever ask for in a bar. Its a dive. Its has awesomely random and strange decorum.  Marginally sanitary bathrooms. Cheap whiskey sours. Sassy bartenders. Interesting clientele. Located in a janky neighborhood.  *but no hooks for purses under the bar* (still five star worthy though)  I was already pumped driving by Bikini... I could just tell it was perfect.  As I was arriving a guy was literally thrown out of a neighboring liquor store and stumbled into Bikini.  Interior not disappointing in the least. Behind the bar is full of decorative oddities for your viewing pleasures.  The bartender definitely didn't take shit from anyone *including some strange characters that chatted us up at the bar*.  Beers on tap were $2.75 I believe ... Fat Tire nonetheless! Starting filling up around 10pm with an awesome crowd.  I found myself in a conversation with some 'interesting folk' at the bar next to me about multiple universes and aliens... I didn't have too much to add to that one but you just never know who you'll meet there .... ideal.  A great dive with a diverse bunch of people and the possibility for some great stories if you stick around long enough or stop in often enough :)*** CA$H bar only***~~#~1
WORST SERVICE EVER.  Slow would be a compliment!!!  And the managment doesn't care.  Oh, and the food sucks and the coffee tastes like water. Avoid...~~#~0
Although a bit of a drive, The English Rose Tea Room was well worth it! This was the perfect place for my sister and I to spend a morning brunch on my birthday, yet I hear advanced reservations for any size party is a must, as they are constantly booked for special occassions. Service was excellent and this experience felt much more "authentic" than high tea at a resort. With its extremely pink and girly atmosphere, it's safe to say that you might wanna leave the guys at home :)The tea was exceptionally good. We got the "Paris" which was a black tea infused with caramel and blackcurrent, what they call a house favorite. The waitress kindly refilled our pot with hot water (they use loose leaves, so it can last up to 2 pots). I highly suggest the Tea for Two special. It comes with a 3-tiered rack of 3 types of tea sandwiches, scones, and various desserts. Most people next to us got salads, which looked equally yummy.In addition, they also have a chest full of numerous ornate hats to wear while enjoying your tea. This was too fun!~~#~1
I get the Road Runner Sports catalog in the mail, and was very happy to finally have them finally open up a physical store in the Tempe Marketplace.  From the catalog, I knew they had a wide variety of shoes, clothing, and running accessories, and the store was stuffed full of them.  But once you step inside the store you get something that you cannot get from ordering online: superior customer service.I was having some foot issues from running and wanted to check to see if maybe it was my shoes.  Their sales staff was excellent in analyzing my foot, stride, arch, and so forth and were able to recommend a great pair of shoes that have not caused me any problems whatsoever (that'll teach me to by running shoes at a Nike outlet store).  They've got treadmills set up so that you can test out the shoes and a 30-day return policy on the shoes just in case they don't quite work out for you.For those of you that are avid runners and see yourselves coming to this store often, I'd recommend joining their VIP program.  You'll get discounts both at the store and online and even earn a free pair of shoes too.  You can't be that.  Happy running!~~#~1
This place was absolutely amazing. I was there alone on a sunday afternoon and I was treated like royalty. I orderd the Green Chile pulled pork sandwich and it was the best sandwich I have ever had. -The egg bun was the best part. My server Lexi was knowledgeable and fun, she even reccomended a great cocktail that was thouroughly enjoyed.~~#~1
Moreno's is a staple in the ghetto part of Mesa.  It's the type of place you go when you're craving some good, greasy Mexican food, and don't particularly mind the thought of getting mugged or having your car stolen.  This place might not win awards, but in the realm of hole-in-the-wall Mexican, they are at or near the top.Of course they're known for having Sonoran dogs.  Their Sonoran dogs are a reasonable facsimile of what you'd find in Tucson, but if you're expecting it to be as good as El Sinaloense Hot Dog Cart, you'll be disappointed.  This is simple a satisfy-your-craving type of Sonoran dog.While I usually grab a dog or two when I'm there, where they really shine is their tacos.  They have, of course, the boring carne asada, etc. that most gringos like, but they also have pretty good lengua tacos, and their tripa tacos are phenomenal (I have a very hard time convincing any of my white-bred compatriots to try the tripe tacos, but seriously, people: if you like bacon, you'll love the tripe tacos).They do have much of the standard Mexican fare... Burritos, etc.  They have horchata, jamaica, etc.  I usually prefer to stick with the bottled sodas: Jarritos, Manzana, and my personal favorite, the Mexican Coke in 16-oz bottles.Writing this is actually making me really crave one of those tripe tacos.~~#~1
Total Wine, I know now that I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I guess I had to go through that BevMo phase so I could appreciate when something better came along and now I never look back. I always look forward to seeing you and we always have such a great time together. You never fail to have someting new and exciting for me when I pass through those doors: Fantastic selection of vodka (where else can I find good Russian or even ICELANDIC vodka???) Onto the wine: Nowhere else can I find Pinot Noir from Central Otago in New Zealand or multiple offerings from South Africa. Not to mention the beer. Like I said, always something new. I only fear that I may have to get a second job to keep our relationship going, because I always walk out with my wallet a bit lighter. But you just keep me coming back for more!!! I'll see you again real soon!~~#~1
They are awesome! My fiance and his dad have been going here for years and they know how to take care of their customers. If give it to you straight and don't BS. Take your car here if you don't want to get ripped off!~~#~1
We just had 2 exterior doors replaced by Strong Home Improvement and we love them!!! Travis was a delight to work with - friendly, professional and a great work ethic. I am a very picky home owner and have been known to be a little difficult :) but Travis was able to meet all of my expectations. He came over twice to get the specifics, he explained to me exactly what he was going to do and kept me updated during the project. He was on-time and cleaned-up everything after he was done. We have a great new front door and the backdoor looks great too!I have a couple more projects for Travis and I feel confident in recommending Strong Home Improvement to my friends and family.~~#~1
Everytime I visit my uncle in Apache Junction, we sample at least one of the Phoenix  Metro Area's finest epicurean adventures. On this visit, we selected Cowboy Ciao, based on the outstanding rating and reviews in Yelp. Yelpers, you didn't let us down! This is absolutely THE BEST place we've experienced on all of our sojourns, and we've been to some really good places! There's lots of good stuff to talk about, but the food was so out-of-this-world, let's focus on that. We started with the Mini Mushroom Pan Fry, a smaller version of their "signature dish". The ancho sauce was so incredible that we ordered a ciabatta, not because we really wanted bread, but it would have been criminal to leave even a drop of the sauce behind. Next we had a special appetizer, seared scallops with a shrimp bisque. The scallops were melt-in-your-mouth perfect and the bisque became the next target for the ciabatta, which itself was served with two absolutely delicious olive spreads. We couldn't imagine the dinner getting any better than what was already perfect, but our main courses delivered! We both had the duck breast, a new addition to the menu, replacing the Duck Duck Duck. The duck breast was prepared expertly, rare on the inside, with crisp skin, and bathed in another killer sauce, this time ancho-orange. All remaining scraps of ciabatta were used to wipe our plates clean. We washed all of this incredible food down with a bottle of 2002 K Vintners Syrah, a steal at $62. Their wine list is the largest I have ever seen, but our attentive waiter, Bryan, recommend the K Vintners, and we savored every drop. Bryan was very knowledgeable about the menu and deftly guided us through our completely over-the-top dining experience. Alas, there was no room for any of the many interesting and tasty-sounding desserts. Next time we'll have to plan ahead for those! And there will be a next time...and another...and another...~~#~1
The Prime is a great Chinese restaurant. I have been going there maybe twice a year for several years. it is a bit of a drive, but the food is great, the service is great and it is affordable.They will also specially prepare items that are not on the menu. How many places do that.~~#~1
Amazing true east coast cheese steak sandwiches with real cheese whiz! Employees are friendly and efficient. Service is fast. I would recommend this to anyone from the east coast looking for a bit of home.~~#~1
Simply brilliant.I didn't think I frequent this place that much, but the waitresses know my drink and order, which is outstanding customer service.The food and atmosphere is what I expect of a eating establishment.Can't wait for the new place.~~#~1
OK I am fully sold on this place in every way! As a recent transplant from Ohio I am completely taken by every aspect of this gem of a market! Staff is friendly and informative of not just what is sold here and what activities they sponsor but also what is going on in the downtown Phoenix area and the arts districts happenings. A very community minded feel as well as the greatest healthy food selections is what you will find here. 5 stars!!!!!~~#~1
This has been my favorite restaurant for the last 20 years.  The food is always excellent, and entering through the kitchen just adds to the ambiance.~~#~1
Nice-looking building from the outside, w/ beautiful views of one of the man-made lakes nearby.  I really enjoyed the walks I took in the park that this branch is located in.  Using the library though, is another story.  In the times I've visited, this location was either closed or full of noisy children and pre-teens who ran in and out of its doors unattended and people of all ages who talked loudly on their cellphones.  The computer section was always crowded, and I could never find a seat to use or an empty table void of backpacks and other items left there by their absentee owners.  I'd say that, for the most part, this library looked and sounded more like a coffee shop (there's a section where you can purchase coffee and some pastries) than a quiet library where one may hope to do some productive work.There was a good-sized selection of CDs, DVDs, and books-on-DVDs, which I used a couple of times, that allowed you to place holds on-site and online, and this service was fairly prompt at notifying me of the availability for pick-up, but I quit using the services when my hands, and anything that the items touched, started to smell of body odor from the previous users that handled them!  (I think that many of the handlers carried the items under their armpits as they walked back to the library, which I'm sure we've all done before w/ books and other items, but think about it-- we do live in the middle of the desert, and bodies do get hot and sweaty...)  No matter how many times I wiped the items down w/ sanitizing cloths and washed my hands w/ soap AND sanitized them, the odor wouldn't disappear!  Utterly disgusting, and I'm not exaggerating!  Don't believe me?  Pick up a DVD or book on your next visit and take a whiff...  Don't say I didn't warn you!!Come for the relaxing/energizing walks and views around the lakes.  There's even a playground or two on the other end of the park for children to play in, and many picnic areas w/ grills and tables to use.   You can even go fishing!  [Just don't expect to eat what you catch, though-- the lakes are contaminated w/ toxins and algae (there are signs), and I've seen more than a few floaters and dead small animals bobbing in the water.]  If you plan to walk all of the paths, make sure you have a friend or two accompanying you, esp. around sunset, bec. there's a specific location that only has one entry and exit, which could become dangerous-- if someone's stalking or following you w/ malicious intent, well, you're S.O.L.  I hope your experiences at this library turn out better than mine!~~#~0
I don't even know where to begin...  We came in on Wednesday and really enjoyed our food and service.  We enjoyed it so much that we decided to return last night (Sunday).  It was clearly busier than it had been during the day, however, the experience was not what we had hoped for.  We checked in with the hostesses and were told the wait would be 15-35 minutes.  We decided to put our name on the list and grab a drink at the bar.  They don't have pagers so we wanted to stick near by in hopes a table would open up.  It took nearly 10 minutes for the bartenders to notice us at the end of the bar waiting to order a drink.  I will say, we all enjoyed our margaritas but the wait was a little much.  As we finished up our drinks, we realized we had been waiting for 45 minutes at this point.  Checked with the hostess stand and they said another 10-15 minutes.  Waiting.. waiting.. waiting.. another 25 minutes went by and then we were seated.  We were surprised because we noticed multiple vacant tables where we were seated and wondered why we had not been seated sooner, knowing we could have been in and out by this point.  We first thought, perhaps they were all reserved?  But we did not see anyone sit at any of these at any point.  We started off with the guacamole and then ordered our entrees.  Our server returned quite some time after we had ordered our entrees and let us know one of the items we had ordered had been 86'd for the night.  We wondered why it not only took him this long to let us know, but why our entree orders were being put in after so much time had elapsed at this point.. There were three people at our table and one persons order came out first.  The server was apologetic but she finished her entire meal before mine and the other persons came out.  The timing could not have been more off.  The food was not as great as the first time and neither was our experience.  Our server was kind but full of excuses.  Two of us at the table work in a restaurant and understand things happen and problems do occur.  However, we both felt it could have been handled much better.  We won't be rushing back here anytime soon, if at all.~~#~0
I love a good pizzeria and this place always delivers great, filling pizza. Period.  I don't get why people would go for Domino's or Pizza Hut when you can have Grimaldi's.~~#~1
This was my first time to this place, not really knowing anything about it - only joining my friend for her birthday. Not alot of parking, but that is pretty much the only thing I could possibly complain about. Nice intimate atmostphere to just have good solid fun with good people. Customer service was good (server took my beer/glass - without asking me if I wanted another). The bathroom is very clean and can probably be described as very zen-like. Food wise - the bruschetta impressed me alot, actually the whole place did so I will definately be back. Mostly to participate in the 11-4 5$ wine!!~~#~1
If you don't mind waiting in line and then having car, after car, behind you go into the wash before you, you'll be fine. They appear to be group of unhappy workers that  are actually trying to undermined the process and intentionally make customers mad.  Unfortunately I have a prepaid card so I've gotten to experience this a dozen times.  It's unpleasant to pay $15 for a wash and always leave ticked off or to constantly tell them, no others were here way before me!  Fair is fair and their management needs to get out front and correct this problem.~~#~0
Yum, yum, yum.  This place really hit to spot for what i was looking for which is pork.  Tender, tasty, tender, tasty pork.  We didn't have reservations so yes, we sat on the patio.  We were pretty much the only ones there because we were waiting for the sun to go down, and once it did, that patio got packed.  So timing is everything, keep that in mind.We ordered the simmered pork shoulder tacos as recommended by our waiter.  I'll talk more about him later...The tortillas are about 3-4 inches wide and are homemade. Delicious. Warm.  The meat was flavorful and tender, and you have several sauces to dress your tacos. Service was fantastic. He was very honest with us about his favorite dishes and had great recommendations for cocktails.  HB tried the avocado margarita, which he liked.  I always stick with the margarita on the rocks, the classic.  Then you can tell if they actually put booze in their drinks (which they did this particular night).  Well, while we were eating we overheard they have a pig roast brunch on Sundays, so we went the next day and had more pork.  They had choices of the simmered pork shoulder or carnita style pork, and again this had the baby tortillas and toppings like pineapple salsa, cilantro, onion, avocado sauce, this kind of stuff.~~#~1
After a trip to the Market, I was roped into trying a short leash dog. I generally as a rule of thumb, refuse to eat hot dogs, but I decided to make an exception, because Sean S. said they were sooooo good. I decided to have a vegetarian dog with mango chutney, jalapeño, and mayo. It was pure heaven and served on a delicious piece of naan. Kudos to the creativity of the dog topping combinations. The combinations are named after the owners pets, dogs none the less - how cute is that? Delicious, filling, and unique. What more can I say? Stop by the Market on Wednesday night or Saturday morning and try one for yourself!~~#~1
This is one of the few places I can go, sit at the bar, & order a nice dinner & maybe a Blue Moon and feel "among my people." Also...I can bring my 80something parents and 50something siblings here on St Pat's Day (granted- DAY, not night) and they fully enjoy it. Finally...this is where I learned that my culture has FOOD! Yes- the Irish have a culinary heritage. Who knew. At Rula it looks like: salmon, boxty, bread pudding ice cream, shepherd's pie. Don't let the bar appetizers keep you from ordering 1 or 2 great entrees....~~#~1
Friday Hot SpotI think the crowd during Friday Happy Hour is nice and talkative. Come out and get to know Gay Men in PHXIf anything, you can enjoy the little one that runs around taking your drink orders. Gina & Andy are great at remembering your drink order also.~~#~1
I looooove this place. It's a good thing I only work in our Phoenix office on Fridays because otherwise I would go broke. Au Petit is the most adorable little French cafe. The dessert case will make you salivate - the desserts are all perfect little pieces of art just tempting you to cheat on your diet.I usually get the tomato basil soup, and it's delicious. The sandwiches are quite tasty, too. The location is really convenient for all of the office buildings right in the Biltmore area, but I don't know if I would come here unless I was at work (just because the location is strange). However, if you're ever shopping at the Biltmore mall, do yourself a favor and walk over to Au Petit. The wine list is very good, and there is also outdoor seating for pretty days. The people that work there are very friendly, and the ingredients are extremely fresh. It's not the most economical lunch place, but it's worth every cent on Fridays when I indulge.~~#~1
After noticing the signs showing good deals, went here for lunch on a workday.I had 3 street tacos and a drink for around $4 and they were fantastic!  Lots of flavor!  My boyfriend tried the hamburger and fries for around $5, he liked it!  The fries are freshly made (like In-N-Out) and were good.  Overall great value and location for a quick lunch!~~#~1
Less than zero - closes too early for a frequent traveler.~~#~0
Went here in December....breakfast for two, food came out in a matter of 5-7 minutes...it wasn't a particularly busy Sunday morning because it had rained all morning, but there was dry seating available. Had no problems with the service, it was pretty much on par with what you would expect from a restaurant. The location of the restaurant is what will leave you satiated. Fresh air, great place to walk around after your meal. The breakfast itself was great..i had the waffles, she had the truffle eggs, they both tasted great, but i will say that i preferred the eggs. The waffles are more than filling and will quickly fill your sugar tooth, so if you are looking for something healthier and less sweet - the eggs are definitely the way to go.~~#~1
I loved the tamale sampler and the coconut flan. The tamales each had a unique and incredible flavor even the cheese one. Their salsa is to die for with a perfect blend of taste and spice. I really cannot say enought good things about this place. If you are looking for excellent place to eat I would suggest the jewel.~~#~1
This place was great! My review is based on drinks ONLY. We went to a BBQ joint down the road for dinner and decided to hit this place for a nightcap on our first night in town to unwind. Great choice. We stumbled upon Happy Hour (which lasts until 11pm on Wednesdays) and each had two great drinks.  I'm talking drinks on par with some of the best mixology bars in Chicago - for half the price. We sat outside next to the outdoor firepit and it was the perfect environment.  The staff was excellent, the music was great, and the diverse mix of people sitting in the outdoor patio was friendly and fun.  It's a couple blocks from the Light Rail station so we were back at our hotel in no time.~~#~1
I try to attend Skullpt two to three times a week. I have yet to wake up the morning after a class an not be sore head to toe! They really work you out and I saw results very quickly. Not to mention, this is the best I have felt in my life. I have done several yoga classes as well, and as a beginner, I have learned a lot and have very much enjoyed every class. I really like the instructors and staff at Sutra. I feel comfortable working at my own pace, but feel motivated to push myself every time I am there and try something new. The studio is a great space, the raw juice bar is fantastic. I really can't say enough good things. It is worth every penny because I am improving my health and confidence day by day.~~#~1
I love this place the noodles are hand made, great prices, large portions, super quick and friendly staff !~~#~1
With the internet as big as it is now, how is Gamestop still even in business? If you want to get ripped off on your trades/purchases on new/used games then go ahead and come here. It's Scottsdale! Anything goes!~~#~0
I love this place. The food, the atmosphere (despite the cafeteria style like line - I think it sorta adds to its charm), and the atmosphere are totally on point. Everyone I've taken here loves it. It's just really good. I personally was won over by the bottled sodas and the cheesy potatoes. Don't get me wrong, the pulled pork is fantastic too, but you don't see bottle sodas very often, and I heart potatoes. It's also located in a really cute part of Gilbert which looks like an old town of somesort (forgive my ignorance, I'm a newbie here.)~~#~1
Yes my favorite place.  I first went there when it opened 20 years ago.  Still it's always consistent, always just great!  The thai tea is a gotta have.  I like the Tom ka gai soup.   THe clear noodles are my favorite.  I can never pronounce it, and just go with the waiters recommendation if you don't understand.  I like a little spicy, so just let them know how you want it.  I highly recommend this place.  Give it try....~~#~1
Although I am impressed with the herb store that is part of this establishment, the restaurant leaves a lot to be desired.Let's start with the tables & chairs:  very tiny (like for children's tea parties) and rickety (although it adds to a sense of excitement and paranoia -- to compliment the sense of inferiority they attempt to engender with their "we will wait on you when we feel like it because we are more elightened about veganism than you" treatment).  A few of the items that interested my husband on the menu happened to be unavailable and apparently this is not ucommon at Chakra 4 according to some other reviews here.I ordered the watermelon gespacho (sp?), which was very good.Their bread / toast is another matter.  It was very hard (think thin patio paver).  Although it was drenched in olive oil, I broke the corner of my lower left tooth completely off (I think I must have swallowed it) when biting into it.  Since I didn't realize it until about an hour after leaving the restaurant,  they would not refund the meal or offer to pay my resulting dental bill.  They have a very limited and uncooperative refund policy when it comes to having issues with their food.  I think the only way they would have refunded the meal was if I were accompanied by a camera team who filmed the entire meal and the broken tooth incident, as well as a forensic team who could analyze the contents of my stomach/bowels for the tooth chip, and a cement engineer to test the hardness of their bread/toast versus that of my tooth, which doesn't seem cost effective...  At least I got my calcium when I swallowed my own tooth chip -- I literally got "my calcium"!If you have any old, stale bread that you are considering throwing out, or that has sat in the sun for a few days after accidentally being left on your back patio table following a meal outside, by all means send it to Chakra 4 so they can then TOAST it, then drizzle a little EVOO on it and serve it to their customers -- RECYCLE PEOPLE!  But don't expect any sympathy or cooperation if you leave their restaurant with your smile looking like Wil-E-Coyote's after he accidentally missed the Roadrunner and instead bit down on an Acme metal plate.~~#~0
I  won't eat bagels in Phoenix, so I am not here to review them.  I am only here to say that I had dinner there last night and the place is filthy.  The service awful, at best.  The Reuben sandwich small, flat, greasy, not enough dressing.  The partitions between the booths are so high, that you can't see a server and they can't see you.  I had to wave my napkin high over the wall to get noticed.  And it's not like there were any other customers to serve.  A complete waste of time and money.~~#~0
Clean place, serving Boars Head meats and cheeses and Dreyers ice cream. My kids love it! Kind of an old parlor type feel with the old signs and music.~~#~1
Everything here tastes amazing... and with the prices, its hard to go anywhere else. It can get pretty busy during lunch time, so get here early :)~~#~1
You would think in North Scottsdale, an honest person could leave their sunglasses on the table by accident, come back the next day they would have been saved by the waiter or the bus-boy. NOT AT SALTY'S. THEY ARE THIEVES! Not to mention the food is aweful, and the staff could care less about service.~~#~0
This was the worst experience that I've ever had with a refi...run away as fast as you can!  We opted to not go with the VA 4.25 they offered us and wanted a conventional refi....they tacked on fees that were in access of 16,000 dollars at a 4.5 rate...and that is with excellent credit.  AND they won't even give you true quotes unless you give them $400 via credit card to start the process.  We ended up using DLJ financial in California....they were up front, professional and DID NOT require crazy fees.  Our interest rate is way lower than what quicken quoted us and they responded to every email and phone call quickly.I have no idea how they got rated #1 by JDPowers....RUN AWAY...and use a different company.~~#~0
Another great lunch at Ray's - 2 slices with drink for $4.00.  Crust was just right with golden brown edges, nice crisp on the bottom, moist & chewy in the middle, and topped with a tangy tomato and milky mozzarella cheese.  Crust has a lot of residual flour on the bottom, which is perfect for me (and preferable to cornmeal).Staff are always friendly and the atomosphere has a NY-tribute theme going.  An older crowd was enjoying their slices at lunch today, which is perfectly fine with me.~~#~1
If you are lucky enough to get the new girl, Brigitte, you are in for a treat. She is the best waitress in the whole place, and probably any restaurant, anywhere.The food doesn't need a review, everyone already knows its the best BBQ in Phoenix. Bring a few friends and split a garbage pail!~~#~1
The food was wonderful! Nothing trendy, not a chain, or anything remotely like one. The atmosphere was a little quirky but who cares? The food was like a Scandinavian grandma would make. Absolutely delicious!And the chicken schnitzel was to-die-for!~~#~1
Yum. This is the best Chicago style dog I've had outside of Illinois. That neon green relish? It's called "nuclear relish" and it is totally at home on top of that poppy seed bun. Son had the bacon cheeseburger with their special sauce (which IS NOT 1000 Island dressing). Amazing. Fresh beef, juicy, hand cut pickles...and those french fries! You totally think that they will be a public school cafeteria grade spud but that is not the case. Fresh, hot, perfectly salted, real potatoes and the price to feed a family with this quality of food was highly reasonable. Also, you can never go wrong with a bucket o' soda to wash all of it down with and that's what you get with the combo.I totally recommend. Just don't affect a weird "da bears" accent when you're ordering your food. That makes you the person who tries to order in all Spanish at Macayo's. They don't care and then people like me write about you in yelp reviews.~~#~1
This is one of the best food stores in town. The staff are friendly & helpful. The store is always spotless & very well stocked. Their checkouts are all fully automated and they have a ton of them so there's alkmost never any line, you just scan everything yourself and swipe your card to pay. While you are doing that there is usually someone who will come by and bag for you. They often have boxes for you to leave your receipt in so a local school can get credit for your purchases and then money is donated to that school, F&E is a great store for small families down to as few as a couple or even a single person. They always have good specials & they usually have some organic items too. Look out for their samples, it always makes shopping here fun. If you like English foods, they have more than most since they are owned by Tesco which is one of the largest supermarket chains in the world. Tesco has massive supermarkets in the UK and here in the US they have set up F&E as a chain of smaller stores, but as a company they really know how to conduct business. Look for Heinz Baked Beans which come in cans and are good heated and served on buttered toast. Another English favorite which they have in cans is a sponge pudding called "Spotted Dick" - don't knock it till you've tried it!! In England it's usually served with custard (English style - they sell packets of Bird's custard which is made by mixing the powdered contents in the envelope/packet with milk while heating slowly. This dish (custard) easily develops a skin on top which most people find pretty gross, so heat it carefully and follow the instructions carefully. I personally prefer Golden Syrup on my spotted dick, which is a treacle like thick syrup but F&E don't carry Golden Syrup. However, if you find a store that sells English items they will sometimes have Tate & Lyle's Golden Syrup - it comes in a can with a lid that you pop off them re-seal for storing the unused portion, rather like a tea can. Drizzle one teaspoon of golden syrup over the warmed spotted dick for a rare treat!! You can sometimes find English products, including Golden Syrup, at World Market.~~#~1
Remind me never to drive thru here again. If I check-in again - shoot me. I'm not a huge fan of Sonic, except I like their limeades and crushed ice. I've never been to this location before and I won't recommend it.The service was fine. The gentleman who took our order was patient and nice. However, whoever prepared the food didn't prepare it as we ordered it. I asked for no mayo and got mayo. That pretty much ruins the burger. How can you take mayo off? Yuck. My daughter's chicken whatevers (bits? pieces? nuggets?) caused her to ask "Is this chicken?" She's 10, and not that picky. So that must have been pretty bad.I thought it interesting that the drive thru guy encouraged me to fill out the survey to be entered for a drawing for a free something or other. Why? Because he didn't give my daughter any honey mustard sauce after he attentively asked how many packets she wanted. I usually don't fill out those surveys. I may start now...Nice drive-thru guy. But absent-minded (I suppose we all have those days.)Good slushes and limeade. (This would be the only reason I'd come back.)Bad food.~~#~0
Great place hiden in a strip mall. INCREDIBLE burgers and great atmosphere.  I wish I didnt live so far away, I'd be there every week!~~#~1
They make appointments and its always been on time with very quick installation.  The prices were comparable to the Sams and Costco.  On another visit, they were fixing my flat, damaged the tire getting it off the rim, and gave me another brand new tire for free - no questions asked.~~#~1
I owe 2 of my 5 stars to timing alone.  I've enjoyed reading my fellow Yelper reviews on this place, and understand the mixed bag.  Had our timing not been lucky, perhaps my 2nd-only 5-star rating would be down to a 3.5 or 4.  I hear you out there, with the concerns of service, sitting way too close to someone else, Noca always being out of at least one item (happened to us the other night, also), etc.  I get this.  However, I do my best to try not talking myself into hating something before I give it a shot.  I don't wrinkle my nose at a previously opened bottle of wine from 5 minutes ago and claim that it's "turned" and demand a fresh bottle.  And despite my God-given right of sending a $35 plate back to the kitchen if it isn't prepared correctly; I think I've only done this once in my life.  And I felt like a douchebag when I did.We arrived early (around 5:20ish), without reservation.  I asked if they had a table open, jokingly, because we were the only people there.  Of course they were ALL reservered, but they had seating on the patio.  Fine by us.  And that made the dinner great, despite being seated in the parking lot and wondering why, and who, would park their burgundy circa 1986 Chysler New Yorker right there on the curb and leave it.  These minor things aside, we had the patio to ourselves, which meant not having to sit on top of other guests and/or listen to their inane conversations.  It was perfect.  And then the food came.We started with the clam chowder and shared.  Awesome.  Rich, artery-clogging, heavy-cream and butter filled bowl of awesome.  With bacon.  Everything's better with bacon.  My gal ordered the pasta special of the day, and I dove in to the pork belly with risotto.  Easily, hands down, the most tender pork I've ever eaten anywhere.  I am not a risotto connoisseur, I mean, I know when something tastes awesome, but I haven't traveled around and experienced the risotto tours of the valley.  What I do know is that this was like eating a smooth, cheesy cloud with an egg atop.  Paired with the pork belly, I was stuffed but wanted more.  Immediately.We cleaned our plates, were drinking our drinks and then came the purple bouffant wig of cotton candy.  What?  Seriously, it would have fed a table of 8.  Outside of that cotton candy experience, I think the one and only other time I've had cotton candy was at the state fair when I was in junior high or something.  It was a nice touch, but entirely over the top for a table of 2.  Just spin a little of it, put it in a ramekin and that would suffice.  But I still had to go with the homemade donuts for dessert, with the caramel, chocolate and blueberry dipping sauces.  3 small donuts, 3 small donut holes.  Perfect.  And 2,000 calories ingested.Food - excellent!Patio to ourselves - excellent!I almost don't ever want to go back because I wonder if they'll hit this pinnacle again.  But we sure hope so.~~#~1
Short StoryExecution of food was perfect.Flavors and seasonings were spot on.Some unexpected elements of surprise moves the food past four stars.Perfect portions,not too much not too little.Atmosphere maybe isn't quite five stars but I was happy with the food.Long StoryThey started us off with the most amusing looking amuse bouche I've ever seen. A tiny piece of a cherry tomato on a bunch of tiny plates. But wow that tiny morsel of tomato was packed with a mouthful of flavor.The spicy sausage was very good and the chick peas were clearly NOT of the canned variety and seemed like cooked and then maybe roasted nicely with a crispness.The simple salad really wasn't so simple as it was made of high end ingredients such as endive, apples, Marcona Almonds, Garrotxa Cheese. The careful slicing of the ingredients made the texture interesting and the vinaigrette was so bright and fresh and perfect the salad was outstanding.The pasta was perfect and light with the right texture and made with local Hayden Farms semolina flour.I had to ask about the pasta because it looked darker than semolina it really was interesting. I thought the beef short rib ragu was perfect not fatty but cooked down with perfect seasonings. Prosciutto wrapped fennel and cheese stuffed Pork Loin was prepared perfect being moist and flavored well.They gave us a giant bowl of green apple cotton candy.Ricotta fritters were yummy!The Triple Chocolate Flan really didn't seem like flan but had the taste of pots de creme but not the mouth feel being  what seemed like lighter. It had these praline rice crisps that sort of tasted like hazelnut that were yummy and on the side was a salty buttery cookie that went well with it.They gave us chocolate chip shortbread cookies to take home.I was very happy with the food and service.The dining room is a little dark and I almost needed a flashlight to read the menu. Tables are close together. This is a small restaurant in a strip mall.~~#~1
Gross. The buffet was watery, bland, and luke-warm. The only vegetables included potatoes and an occasional pea. Also, two of the dishes tasted like Velveeta.Definitely not worth $11.~~#~0
Eggs are eggs, omeletes are omeletes until you try them at Breakfast Joynt.  Their secret...oven toasted after grilled to perfection.  The servers are friendly and accomodating. Coffee refills without having to ask. Start your day off right...An egg is not an egg at The Breakfast Joynt. ENJOY...~~#~1
There is not one bad thing to say about Mastro's. From the service, to the beverages, to the menu - everything is top notch and classy. They say it is an "unparalleled dining experience" and they are not lying. The ambiance in the place is wonderful. I've been there a few times and have tried a few things. I always get the Filet because it is as close to perfection as is humanly possible. The steaks come out on scorching hot 400 degree plates and are placed in front of you with sheer decadence. The mashed potatoes are incredible. The Lobster mashed are the greatest thing ever. The mac and cheese is to die for. It is the perfect blend of cheeses and creaminess. The asparagus is perfectly scorched (in a great way). You will not regret your choice.~~#~1
If you are a Yelper, chances are better than good that you appreciate cool kitchen stuff. Williams-Sonoma is the Disneyland of cool kitchen stuff, and the weekend before Xmas I went out in search of gifts like any good procrastinating guy. The store was bustling and busy, but the staff were great and very helpful. They had samples of this amazing hot chocolate that puts Starbucks to shame. My brother and I were arguing about what a weird little tool did, and we found an employee named Claudia, who was friendly, funny, and helpful. She explained what it was for, which sucked, because it meant my little brother was correct, which pains me to no end. Claudia had some great tips on cooking gadgets, and really made the shopping experience fun. Well done WS!~~#~1
Brunch on Sunday after New Years was perfection!  First, the setting is magnificent with splendid table settings, modern design and superb views.  We were warmly welcomed and given a view table.  Excellent Spanish sparkling wine promptly served while awaiting friends.  Fresh squeezed OJ brought in beaker to make our own mimosas.  Bloody Mary's can be ordered at a hefty charge, but not needed when bubbly is included.  Buffet is modest compared to some, but here quality wins out with nicely displayed salads, fruits, cheeses, cold meats, fantastic smoked salmon, cold shrimp, crab and bagels, breads, etc.  Huge omelets are included and made to order.  Do not miss the buffet of small desserts--all outstanding in appearance and taste.  The pecan pie miniature was my favorite.  Superb service with silver and plates changed as required without asking.  Will not wait for New Years to return.~~#~1
I recommend CCC to my friends.I stopped by Central Car Care 3 years ago, because I had a nagging problem with my car. They figured it out and fixed it. Then, I had a battery problem and I asked them about it and they checked it for free.I have an old Blazer, so they have repaired many worn out parts. Recently my air conditioning system, started blowing hot air. They got the job done quickly, professionally and I was happy to have cold air.They always do a great job and charge me a fair price. They are nice and talk my language, which is not "auto shop language." In all these years, I don't have one complaint about Paul, Rex, or anyone there, just praise for their great efforts.~~#~1
Was hanging around Desert Ridge & decided to come here for lunch on a weekday.  I think this place used to be Cadillac Ranch, but it seems all Notorious did was put some red picnic plaid table clothes (which was all torn up where I was sitting) & a bottle of bbq sauce and open for biz.   What a waste of a nice restaurant space!!!  So we got the family platter that consisted of:- 1/2 rack of ribs (they said it was lion back ribs (aka babyback) but all we got was spareribs...WTF!)- Pulled pork & brisket (bland & dry)- Hot links (spicy & smokey .....3*)- Sides: cole slaw (hard & under season), corn on the cob (soggy) & sweet potato fries (nothing special)I feel really bad for the one waitress running all over the place.   I didn't mind that she didn't have time to refill my drinks b/c she was hostess, waitress, & cashier for the entire place.  Even the cooks came out to help a little.  So sad!~~#~0
Halo Thrift Store might not be well known, but it's one of the best thrift stores in Arizona.  It's run completely by volunteers and proceeds go to helping local animals.  Halo stands for Helping Animals Live On and they even have pets up for adoption on their website. Halo takes animals off of death row from the county and places them in foster care until a permanent home can be found for them.  They're trying to save up money to open up a shelter, but so far, they haven't made enough to go toward their goal.That's where you come in!  Every time you shop in Halo, you'll put them one step closer toward being able to save even more animals from death. I know recently they were thinking that they might have to close their doors because their thrift store wasn't making enough to keep it open.  So hopefully you'll take the time to stop in Halo, do some shopping and help out a really great organization- it's a fantastic and worthy place to spend your money.  The thrift store itself is small, but very well maintained.  You can find some great treasures in it and the best part is that My Sister's Closet donates clothes, jewelry and shoes to them to sell in Halo.  This means that they have fantastic brand names at HUGE savings.  They have Neiman Marcus tops, Ralph Lauren handbags, Hollister tank tops and much, much more! They have clothes, books, shoes, home decor items, animal products and more, but their boutique section is my favorite.  Since they also get donations from some pretty ritzy people, they often have really nice designer bags and clothes in their boutique.  The prices are fantastic- you can get a designer bag that looks brand new for under $10.  You can also find some cool pieces of furniture, paintings, toys, animal clothing and much more here.  This is definitely a thrift store you don't want to miss. If you haven't been, you definitely need to check this place out.You'll be doing something good for animals and yourself too!~~#~1
On a recent business trip, we were directed to Baratin when we couldn't secure a table at FnB.  Eric made the night a fantastic experience, making us feel at home and guiding us through the menu.  We shared the beet salad, trout rillettes, and cheese plate.  Everything was absolutely delicious and plated beautifully.  I appreciated the reasonably priced wine list that included half bottles.  The attached market is very cute, and I wish I had something similar near me.  I would highly recommend Baratin for a lovely, laid back dining experience.~~#~1
Our family has used the services of Data Doctors for many years, first in Tempe and now in Scottsdale. The service at the Scottsdale location on Pima and Pinnacle Peak is outstanding. Both Dale and Mike are very patient and knowledgable. They diagnose the problems with our PCs and communicate the issues and solutions in terms we can understand. They offer several options for repair, some that we can do ourselves at no cost. When we needed a new computer, we bought one built by these guys and it's fabulous. All data was transferred and setup in a format that required very little re-training on our part. Because it is evident that they are not simply trying to sell their services, but rather save their customers money, we are loyal customers for life. Thank you Mike and Dale~~#~1
Around 8 PM my roommates and I are hungry, not wanting to cook, so we decide on pizza. This Pizza Hut is a stone's throw from our house and we have a coupon, sounds simple enough.WRONG.After ordering online, I pull up to Pizza Hut around 8:30 and walk up to the door.It's locked. Confused, I try the other door. Locked. There's a boy inside sweeping. He looks at me, I gesture to the door, and he then continues to sweep. Huh?I walk back to my car and look up the phone number on my GPS, there is no answer, so I drive home. I get to the house and tell my roommates what happened, so we pull up the online order and see if we were able to order due to a glitch, since they were obviously closed. 9 PM closing time. It's now about 8:45 or so, and my phone rings as we are still looking at the computer. "Hey this is... from Pizza Hut.. are you going to pick up your pizza?"Um...I tried.."Okay.. so how long will it take you to get here?"Um...5 minutes I guess...I drive back and walk up to the door. The door is still locked, that kid in the corner is still sweeping. I knock loudly on the door and three people appear from the back kitchen area. "Sorry about the mix up, we upgraded your order for you."Open the box- instead of the Supreme Pizza Mia we ordered is a very old looking pepperoni stuffed-crust pizza.Huh?"So the total is $16.25."What? Is this happening?.. Um I'm not paying for this...Everyone looks at everyone awkwardly, but the kid in the corner keeps sweeping."Oh.. Okay..hold on."The man in a tie, who I assume is the manager goes into the back and grabs one of their new pasta dishes, and puts it on top of the unwanted pizza."Tell you what- Dinner is on me today, miss, have a great night."Um.. okay.. Thanks...Never got an explanation for the bizarre first trip and more importantly never even got the pizza we ordered.Drove back home.~~#~0
Wait times are reasonable. If you arrive and there is a line, they'll take your name and you can go run some errands and return without loosing your place. While they do attempt to up-sell you on product (come'on fellas, some of you need some help in this area), they are not pushy at all. Ask for either Aja or Tina, both are very friendly and professional and know how to give a haircut! Thanks.~~#~1
A definite MUST DO if you happen to be in Phoenix!!! If I lived in Phoenix, I'd be a member and a volunteer!!! :)After a full day of eating from the day before, I wanted to do a non food outing. My friend suggested the Botanical Garden which was a 30 minute drive from her place in Scottsdale. The parking lot was packed when we arrived at 930am. My friend was shocked at how crowded it was considering the past few times she'd been here, there'd been plenty of parking spots.  We eventually found a spot by following a couple who were walking back to their car. FYI parking is free but in cases where the parking lot is completely full you may have to wait it out OR possibly forgo visiting the Garden since the parking lot is the only place to park your car--there aren't any side streets to park on. As we stood in line to purchase our tickets, surrounded by families with young children, we found out why it was so crazy busy:  the Garden was hosting "The Great Pumpkin Festival" which happened to be the same exact weekend we were at the Garden. This Festival offered plenty of activities for families: a hayride; pumpkin carving and decorating; a hay maze; a petting zoo; carnival games; and a free pumpkin for every child under 12.  How cute is that!!!Admission for adults is $18. My friend had a 50% groupon for herself so her ticket was $9. A random guy came up to us and asked if we wanted his extra coupon that he and his family weren't using. I gladly accepted and once we got to the counter, my admission was free AND I also had FREE access to the butterfly exhibit which wasn't included in my friend's groupon deal. However the admissions guy ended up giving us 2 butterfly admission stickers--1 for me and 1 for my friend. Thanks random guy  & admissions guy for being nice and generous!!  Off we went to explore the Botanical Garden. My 4 favorite things during my visit:1) The Chocolate Flower: no joke this is a flower that smells exactly like chocolate; how did I not know about this?!  2) Upon walking further we approached some cacti that were enormously tall; think sequoia tree height (ok I exaggerate, but these cacti were the tallest I've ever seen). I was in awe.3) The random tidbits and interactive displays that provide useful information as to what you're seeing or the history behind it. 4) The layout of the Garden was easy to follow and made it easy to not really miss anything. Upon entering the Garden there's main trail that loops around, but along the main trail there are 4 sub-trails that will loop you back where you turned off of the main trail. My favorite trail was the "Plants & People of the Sonoran Desert Loop Trail." The weather was warm but bearable. Bring bottled water, sunglasses, hats, and comfortable shoes since there's hardly any shade and most of the trails are dirt trails. We arrived at 9:30am and managed to see most of the Garden, including the Butterfly exhibit, by 11am. I absolutely loved visiting this place and wouldn't mind going again especially to the various events they host throughout the year...just another reason to re-visit Phoenix!!! :)~~#~1
Love this place! You go in and 30mins  and $35 later  (unless you buy four and its $25 which I do!) your hair looks amazing and you feel pampered and ready to go out. They also do makeup and I can tell you that their facials are the best in town!  Trust me- I am one picky customer and they never disappoint.~~#~1
Best German food in town!!!!  Highly recommend the platter for two!  Has everything from schnitzel to sausage to yummy potatoes and cabbage...mmm mmm gooood!~~#~1
Gorgeous resort. Friendly and helpful staff. Beautiful golf courses. Great food. And the Golden Door Spa is world class. I can't recommend it enough.~~#~1
After waiting for over an hour (also with 2 little kids )I finally get my $16.00 spicy chicken pasta and the noodles are hard... this isn't what I would expect after waiting so long. At this point I have no desire of waiting for them to bring me a new plate.  They didn't even offer to take it off the bill! There are tons of places to choose in this area I'm  not sure I will ever go back.~~#~0
Pizza is pretty dang good. Calzone is frickin' ridiculous! The best I've had outside of Metro Pizza in Vegas. It's big enough for two average eaters or one me. Plus, it's only 8 bucks. Can't beat it.~~#~1
My haircut was awesomely done, Shampoo+cut+blowdry for $20. Price was very reasonable and the staff were friendly. I now know where to go for my regular haircuts. I'm going to try their magic hair treatment next year and write about it when I get it done.~~#~1
Shelley doesn't disappoint! I meandered back in today. Heaven help me!On the counter she proudly displayed her experimental "tweenkies". Um, yum. Yes, I ate one. She looked at it before she gave it to me, and said, "I need to make sure that I've put enough filling in. Here, let me put some extra next to it just in case."I responded, "Well, we wouldn't want me to miss out!"I also told her that one of the oatmeal caramel bars told me it needed to go home with me. She examined the bars and made sure the biggest one is the one I got. :)I think Shelley and my personal trainer are going to have to have a smack-down in the near future.~~#~1
I don't know where all those people who have given them 4-5 stars rating, We went in there for the 1st time, from San Diego where they know how to make Mexican Food. We waited 43 mins. before being waited on and served. The food was less then mediocre at best, and the service is below average. 1st and last time there.~~#~0
While mesmerized by watching my dinner prepared some questions occurred to me.  Does this count as dinner theater?  How much sake can I consume?  Is a beating heart of rice romantic?  Will my wife be distressed because her tofu is where the shrimp was on the grill?  Is it okay to talk with my mouth full when asked a question by the wait staff (he contemplates the answer to this question at all restaurants)?  What is the meaning behind throwing shrimp tails into your hat and front left pocket?  Am I still writing coherently (he'll check later anyway)?  When did my daughter fall asleep on my shoulder?  Is my grandmother-in-law going to pay even though we came for her birthday?  When will the check come?  Answers: definitely, 2/3rd of the bottle, not really, probably, also probably, who knows, also who knows, a little after her bed time but before finishing her homework, she tried, and soon.~~#~1
We went to Pizzeria Bianco expecting a mega long wait, but only had to wait 15 minutes for a table. They have it set up so that you can wait at the bar next door and they will tell let you know when your table is ready, so it makes a potentially long wait not too bad.We ordered the mozzarella salad and biancoverde (?) pizza. The fresh mozzarella was amazing! I've had this salad many times before all around the world, and the cheese quality here was just so great. The pizza had rosemary and local pistachios on it, making it a unique combination. I would definitely have waited WAY longer for this pizza!!!The service is also fantastic! They had most of our food to us within 10 minutes and were constantly checking up on us and our drinks. I love this place!~~#~1
If there was such a thing as zero stars- this place would be it! A friend a I went for Restaurant week and the food was nothing to ever go back to. We had the crab "cakes" which I am surprised they can even get away with calling it that- more like fried crab and mayonnaise balls. Then, we had both had a Chili and Coffee rubbed Scallops. They cut the scallops in half to make it look like more, dunked them in a oil bath and then poured coffee grinds and chili paste all over... mmm yummy!!! The best part of the meal comes with the check: they neglected to tell us that after a month of being in business, they still have not connect their American Express machine. When we went to pay, the server said "ohh we can't take that yet." To which my friend and I argued that we should have been notified ahead of time, what if we have nothing else to pay with?? The conversation gets so ridiculous that the manager comes over and tells us it's not his fault and there is nothing he can do so I will have to pay for the entire meal with cash or another credit card. "I told my servers to tell each table" he said. I'm pretty sure that's not a good enough explanation. I am sparing you tons of heated details... the bottom line is I give this place 5 months tops and it will be donzo!~~#~0
Cafe Monarch is a treasure.  I'm sad there isn't a place like it back where I live.  I am in town for the weekend and had dinner here last night with my family.We were taken to the kitchen to meet the chef before we were seated outside in the courtyard.  It was lovely.  We brought a bottle of wine and enjoyed the appetizer: fresh mushrooms, asparagus, roasted bell peppers, proscuitto and pesto with lavash crackers.  It was a generous portion and both my mother and I felt like we could have walked away after the appetizer satisfied!The two entrees were absolutely fantastic.  Pork with cheddar polenta and some sort of (delicious) new mexico chile sauce.  Scallops fried in panko with arugula and heirloom tomatoes.  We tried both and were very satisfied.  Again, the portion was quite healthy and we felt totally satisfied.Dessert was good.  Fresh berried, mango with vanilla ice cream and fried wontons with chocolate sauce and berry sauce.  Service was terrific.  We had a great time and wish we could go back tonight!  If we lived in AZ, we would come back on a weekly basis!~~#~1
This place is awesome.  It is truly one of the best restaurants I have ever been to.The atmosphere is so inviting; it is almost like home.  There is even a little waiting area that feels like a living room.The service was outstanding, friendly, accommodating, polite, and not at all stuffy.The whole thing has a very modern feel to it right down to the food, which consists of small and larger (sharable) plates.  The food is just fantastic.  I recommend the following:Cheese Curds: a light snack to start off and they are AMAZING.Brussels Sprouts: I don't like Brussels sprouts but I like these Brussels sprouts.Shrimp Po-Boys: FantasticChicken& Waffles: LoLo's it is not but the fried chicken is delicious.  It's more of a Italian style than a southern one: light and crisp, not battered and fatty, but delicious for sure.Lamb Meatballs: Really exceptional; don't pass these upI wasn't as blown away by the mac and cheese as others seem to be.  Maybe this is worth a try though but it wasn't my thing.The drinks are also excellent.  All of them are thoroughly homemade.  They make one of the best Dark & Stormy's ever.GO NOW!~~#~1
Probably one of the best Gyros I've had in Phoenix!  What is also great is you can order from their website, pay for it and have it ready for you when you get there!  (Great for those of us with 30 min lunches).~~#~1
Wow, the food here is so good and very cheap. Our Family ate here under $20 and had so much food left over. Plan on waiting a little bit for your food as everything is cooked fresh as you order it. But it is definitely worth the wait. Everything we ordered was delicious. We asked the owner / waiter what to recommend & tried a variety of items. The tamales & beans we the best restaurant tamales I have ever had, they will keep us going back for more!~~#~1
We were in Phoenix last week visiting relatives, and we went to this restaurant with my sister in law.It's the second time we have eaten there.Fantastic is not too strong a word for the food here.  The lemon chicken was outstanding.  Freshly made as can be and light and tasty.  We also ordered Mongolian beef which was good, and the house fried rice which has shrimp, chicken, pork, the works.  That was great.  But I really liked the lemon chicken. This place isn't fancy by any means but the price is right, we got out of there with three of us for about $35.  Woo hoo.  Good food, good service, moderate prices.  It really doesn't get much better than that.  I'll go back whenever I am in Phoenix.~~#~1
All I can say is greek salad, potato salad, and Zoe's signature slaw.( not all together though, you'll explode)  I hate picnic food, but this place puts a spin on it that you wouldn't believe. I practically go broke stopping here after work every day, but my job is so demanding that I fast all day...it's worth the wait!  And if you're ever in a rush, order your food ahead of time and just pick it up...then you don't have to worry about waiting all day for your food at the high rush time (around 11pm-1pm)~~#~1
Out of business, not surprising they have been going down hill for years.~~#~0
The ideal customer for this store is someone who is heavily armed and who has the patience of Ghandi. You would need both to safely navigate the waters of this disastrous store.This is the nearest grocer for downtown residents, and it is sad that this store misses the mark by such a huge margin.On any day, the parking lot is covered in grease, coffee, and trash. IF by some miracle you are able to get inside without being hit up for money by tweakers, then the heavens are smiling on you.Once inside the store, your adventure is just starting. The characters inside the store are the inspiration for the bar scene in Star Wars. Very random and sketchy. As far as the contents of the store, to be fair they have all the stuff you need, and at a reasonable price point.The huge problem here, is everything else. During peak hours, they have very few lanes open, that is a consistent failure with this store. Customer service is also dead here, and they just don't know how to take care of customers. I feel as though the broken window theory is at play here. It seems like because they don't take care of the parking lot, and other details, the whole place goes to hell. The store also has a serious shoplifting problem. I'm not sure if they just don't staff the loss prevention unit, or if they are inept, but I have seen at least four episodes where a cashier is confronting a thief. It makes for an unsafe situation for everyone. They do have private security there, and the guys seem really nice, but clearly in over their heads. At this point the store is so far gone, they really need off-duty police officers to make it safe.It really seems like this store just doesn't give a shit. At each opportunity to impress, the complete opposite happens. This place is a huge safety problem, and I would hate to have my sisters or Mom go to this place, it's really that shady. See for yourself, but be on your toes.~~#~0
Everybody likes Dos.  I've found its the first place anyone from out of town is taken because its the prefect entry level Scottsdale bar.  While you'll find some really good looking people really dressed up, for the most part, this is one of Old Town's more laid back nighttime hangouts.  Imported friends arent scared off by pretentious club-goers, instead they are welcomed with obnoxious open arms and peanut shells on the floor.  Drinks are cheap (Coronas are always just $2, mixed drinks are $6 and up) and the food is tolerable when you're a bit buzzed up.  Bar Mexican food is always a nice finale to 12 or so margaritas, thats what I always say.Dos is known as a "great place to day drink" and it is that too.  Grab a stool on the patio and youre sure to make friends with someone, the gringos here are all pretty friendly.  The "dance floor" (search your way through the crowd to the upstairs back balcony to find it...its small) is always packed at night, and the music aims to please.  Day or night, local or foreign, everyone seems to have a good time at Dos Gringos.~~#~1
08/05/11I went during happy hour. I had two mini-margaritas, which were good.I also has the rum soaked puerco tacos. They were very good. The serving "rack" is a nice gimmick, but I'd prefer a normal plate.The coconut flan was delicious. The service was fast and friendly from beginning to end. Upon entry to the location, I could smell something very pleasant, although I could not determine the source. It was not a food type smell and was not overpowering. I'd like to know what it is, so I can use it in my house.~~#~1
The guy who mentioned that the Italian Grotto was better was demented.  Francos is well priced, very good food, not the junky regulr Italian food but refined Italian food like you get in Italy.  Prices VERY WELL PRICED, small intimate.  The owner has such passion, he is allover the restaurant helping and greeting people.  Where can you get a 3 course meal for two with a decent bottle of Italian wine for less that a $100. Go its worth it.Italian Grotto makes me laugh~~#~1
What? There's something on the northside of Phoenix that reminds me of Brooklyn? After spending every weekday for several months last summer working out of Greenpoint in Brooklyn, I had gotten used to seeing signs in Polish and eating Polish foods and shopping in Polish grocery stores. I was surprised to walk in to Europa and say "Czesc!" (hello) to the girl behind the counter and get one back!5 stars because a) this is an unexpected find and b) they carry authentic Polish brands and foods, not the German stuff with Polish labels and c) I got great service.There's a ton of pastries here and Krakowska ham and my favorite- gypsy bacon. I've only so far had some cold cuts (which were excellent) but I will be back for some sauerkraut, some pierogi and for lunch sometime as well.It's really great to find these foods in Phoenix.~~#~1
This place makes me hate Mexican food. Everything is fried... bland and gross.Don't expect to leave without adding 2,000+ calories to your daily diet.I know that other people have raved about their $2 beer happy hours. This place is right off Mill Ave!! There are better happy hours and better beers all around Mill!This place is the McDonald's in the ghetto version of a Mexican restaurant.~~#~0
Been here twice now and I really like this place!  Great healthy choices for lunch and it is not that expensive.  Both times I have come I have had the My Sherry A'more it is grilled chicken, white onions, button mushrooms, and fresh baby spinach sauteed in a robust sherry sauce, with diced roma tomatoes, jasmine rice, and feta cheese wrapped in a tomato basil tortilla... YUMMY!  This is going to be one of my regular lunch places now.  Also they have a strawberry lemonade that I am sipping right now that is so refreshing!~~#~1
We have tried several pizza places in the 6 + months we have been in the valley. So in our progression we came across Lucky's. Man what a great place, ordered 2 large NYS pizzas and 10 wings, wanted to get a feel for their wares.WE WERE NOT DISAPPOINTED!!!! I have 5 people in my family and we had almost a whole pizza left for the upcoming week. There is nothing much better that really good pizza that you can eat on all week.Give these guys a try, you can feed the whole family and not break the bank!~~#~1
Kinda gross that the cook had his hair loose. Also, the nachos weren't all that flavorful. Def not worth $8.~~#~0
BJs food is always worth the wait. Our server wasn't excellent, but the food was hot and tasty. I had the chips n salsa to start. Love their salsa and the chips are thick, warm, and crunchy. I think they are made from tortillas instead of actual chips. The chicken tenders were very juicy and cooked just right. My husband had the peperoni mini deep dish, his favorite, and the broccoli cheddar soup. The pizzas speak for themselves, always thick and crunchy on the outside, warm and chewy on the inside. The soup was thick and creamy, good consistency. Match it with the Pale Ale and you've got quite the meal :)~~#~1
This is absolutely my favorite Mexican food restaurant. I live in Flagstaff but eat here every time I am in the Phoenix area. I have tried several menu items and they are all amazing! Everything was always fresh, including the salsas. Tried several of the flavored margaritas and loved them. I don't normally order dessert but was told the cream cheese & carmel mini chimis (with ice cream) were not to be passed up. I was not dissappointed! The staff is super friendly and very attentive. Can't wait for my next visit!~~#~1
If I could give this place zero stars I would. I am going to California next weekend and was told to try Roscoes Chicken and Waffles. That sounded like a good idea to me and I thought I should try a chicken and waffles place here in Phoenix and compare. Well, I found Off Da Hook and thought it sounded pretty good so off I went.    Sadly I will never know if this place is good or not. When I walked in, the place was pretty full with a few people sitting on the little couch in front of the area where you pay. I stood for a second then asked the people on the couch if they had ordered already. This is when then wheels came off. The guy sitting on the couch was rude when he told me they had already ordered. I thought I would wait a sec for the guy standing at the register to finish before I went up to place my to go order. When he left I walked up and waited for the person to come back and take my order. As I stood there I looked around the place and saw a very large employee looking at me. After a minute or so he walked over to me and said, "why dont you have a seat and someone will take your order." I said no problem and mentioned it was a to go order. He looked at me and very rudely said, "yah thats fine just sit down and we will be with you in a minute." I then sat down and the asshole stepped behind me about a foot and started talking to the people sitting on the couch. He sat there and very loudly started insulting me. Telling the people on the couch how stupid I was for standing in front of the register to place a to go order. He was no more than a foot away from me while he was doing this. This is nothing but disgusting behavior. No way in hell am I every going to let anyone to treat me in this manor. I stood up and walked out. This guy is a pig and nothing but. DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE FOR ANYTHING OR ANY REASON. On the way to this dump I drove by Chik-a-rib just down the street so I went there instead. The people there were incredibly nice and bent over backwards to help me while I was there. I ordered the chicken and waffles with onion rings and mac n cheese. THERE FOOD WAS FANTASTIC!!! If you want chicken this is the place to go. Not where the rude assholes work.~~#~0
Love Lux! Urban, eclectic, friendly staff and plenty of tasty treats! Wouldn't be my first choice for a study spot, but def a fantastic hangout venue if you're looking for something chill. P.S. they have alcoholic drinks too if that's your preferred version of a "pick-me-up".~~#~1
Love this place.  It is my go to when I have had a hard day.  While the inside is small, the artwork is great and really I mostly get my stuff to go.Meat:  Carne asada is great, chicken is great, marinated pork is nice and spicy, carnitas are awesome.Burritos:  Basic but tasted good.Bombero: Wow, what an experience.  It is spicy enough you don't really want the marinated pork as it's filler, but it is wonderful no matter what you fill it with, the spicy sauce that is poured over it is what maked it.Tacos: $1 tacos on Tuesdays!! (except they do charge 30 cents extra for flour tortillas instead of corn)  Tastes like what I fell in love with in Rocky Point street vendors.Enchiladas: Excellent, nothing fancy but made right and is so good.Will update as I change up my choices.~~#~1
Update 3/22/12 - Judy B. has deleted the review.Update 3/19/12 - Frenchie B. is user Judy B. now.  Updated 3/16/12:First I was glad to see the owner private message regarding our experience there, that was nice.  But then I noticed the same user end "Frenchie B." wrote a review for Au Petit Four too.  Private Message:  "May be you were shocked by the price you paid, let me tell you we did not rise our price from the esplanade.  You 2 cakes and 2 creme brulee and they are the most expensive of the 10 items ingredients we use are very expensive and high quality.  You should ask the detail bill to Pierre there is no reason you did not have it.  Do not feel ripped off, I feel sorry, because you came over to Scottsdale, but I also Hope to see you again soon.  Thank you and have a nice week end."Part of their review on 3/9/12 states: "Also,  if 50 dollars is to expensive for you after having 2 sodas especially the delicious lemonades who are from france so they are more expensive then a can of coke, 2 meals and 2 desserts then mcdonalds is better for you..price wise of course." After review their review, I was shock to see how they think about their customers.  How 2 faced can you get.  Nice in the private message and then blast a customer on a public review.  If I would have had 2 drinks, 2 meals, and 2 desserts for $50, that is a great deal.  We had 5 non-alcoholic drinks, 4 desserts, and a cookie for $48.50.  You know, we should have taken the kids to McDonalds for dessert.  To read the rest of Frenchie B.'s review:  http://www.yelp.com/biz/au-petit-four-scottsdale#hrid:b6f4KzsK5ApkWZxLumt-SA~~#~0
What a gem! All the positive reviews are spot on. Since the weather has finally reached the time where we can take advantage of sitting outside, we did. Not much of a view @ nite, but the patio is very nice & well-appointed. But the food/libations are the start. The shrimp scampi won't disappoint. Very flavorful sauce, a bit of a spice which was very nice. Zesty clams in white sauce was a hit, too. A lot of options on the menu from pastas to flatbreads to pizzas and salads. And the beer offerings & wine list are impressive as well. The place is owned by the same people who own Sacks & they take great pride in their culinary offerings. If you haven't been here, make it a priority! I know we'll go back, and often.~~#~1
It is so refreshing to have Euro stuff on the east side. Get out and drive on down to Pastis, it is located just off of the US-60 in Mesa and is not to be missed by fans of color, flavor and meaty goodness.Basic impression: Multicultural cuisine served by multicultural staff in a relaxed and welcoming environment. The service my party experienced was friendly, talkative, doting without being clingy, and well versed in the menu. The menu is without pretense and easy to navigate. The crepes are delightful, way too big, and otherwise a nice way to top off a meat-and-potatoes ribsticking entree or luscious sandwich. The spice and flavor palettes are well thought out and applied perfectly, if anything the hotness of some spices has room for improvement but they are preparing Balkan/Mountain Slav food for Americans so there have to be some sacrifices made to find middle ground. The veggie stuffed and cheese stuffed pork tenderloins are awesome. Portions are incredibly generous and make for great leftovers. It is taking a lot of willpower to not just delete the body of this review and replace it with NOM NOM NOM GO TO PASTIS IT IS HELLA GREAT NOM NOM NOM.The grocery section of Pastis made for some interesting shopping as it was really a Paneuropean selections ranging from ajvar (hot and mild, think Serbian salsa), to Milka chocolate, to Colman's mustard (exceptional English mustard), and a delightful range of lemonades from France. Be prepared to spend extra time and money on your Pastis experience because of the coldcut case full of sausages and cheeses.~~#~1
We went to the Shimogamo for the first time on Friday night.  A dour man who appeared to be the manager approached us and said "We have no more space."  Not a greeting, not offer of a wait time, not anything but "no more space".We left without having an food because we were definitely not welcome; more of an inconvenience the manager.~~#~0
Just moved to the area and found this place on yelp. Was fast and not that expensive. The customer service was excellent. The manager helped me and was super nice. Definitely will be back.~~#~1
HEAVEN. I just had what I can only describe as the most delightful dining experience of my life...From soup to nuts Petite Maison rocked it. Service was wonderful, and was what service should be in every restaurant. Our waiter was a professional, and treated his customers with much respect. He was extremely knowledgeable about wine and food, but explained it in a way that lacked any condescension. I think we've all had that person who knew more than you, and made sure you knew they were superior. Not one ounce of that here at all!The food was all wonderful. I am not going to go into all the boring details, because I am sure you have a life and other reviews to read. Just go yourself, and experience Petite Maison. Make a night of it, take friends, or a date, but just do it, & soon!~~#~1
I bought items that I would normally purchase at Circle K or Safeway, but was able to avoid dealing with eccentric transients and dirty mop buckets. Also, they sell Spam.~~#~1
I purchase a groupon for $119 for 4 hours of window cleaning. I called to schedule on 10/13. The girl that answered asked when I wanted the job done. I said as long as it was before thanksgiving I was good. That was 40 days from now. She said she didn't think she could get me in by then and asked when my groupon expired. Expiration is 12/19. She said she could get me in 2 days before the expiration, if I wanted to use my groupon. She said as an alternative she could get me in at regular price less 10% if I didn't want the promo rate on my groupon. She said she would even apply the $119 I paid for the groupon to the regular price she wanted to charge. Wow, what a scam. I said maybe I should call groupon and tell them about this. She said groupon is real good about giving refunds and maybe I should do that. I have never seen a company put out and offer and so blatantly not honor it. This company has zero integrity and does not deserve your business. I am a HUGE supporter of small business, as a small business owner myself and it was not an easy decision to write this negative review but what right is right and this whole interaction with this company was wrong. Please find someone else to clean your windows or power wash your home.~~#~0
I was there with my parents to see Larry Crowne.  Movie was fine, food and service were good.  I always enjoy my time at Farrelli's.~~#~1
I've had the worst experience at this Wendy's.  I could do a long rant but I'll make this short.1) My 5 year old was served a RAW cheeseburger.  They walked this cow right through the damn kitchen.2) Only one employee seemed to speak enough English for me to attempt to complain.3) The ONLY thing I was given in compensation was a free kiddie frosty.  The manager (wherever they were hiding) didn't even come out to apologize.The employees were too busy doing a chant for Obama than to worry about actually doing there jobs.  While I don't care who they wanted for president, it's a bit disturbing that this was okay with management.If my son gets sick, I promise you that compensation will not be just a frosty.  I've worked near here for over 10 years and it used to be good but it has really gone downhill over the years.~~#~0
I wrote a review on facebook for these guys, but need to spread the word high and low about the service they provided. My dad and I brought our touring bikes in to them after making it from San Diego to Scottsdale. We were staying in Scottsdale on a rest day so had time, but they guys took our bikes in and had them done by the end of the business day because they knew how important the bikes were to us.  I swear I do not think my bike has ever ridden better. We both are on Surly Long Haul Truckers and needed everything from some minor tuning (my bike) to larger derailleur work (dad's bike).  Not only did the guys at the store make us feel so welcomed, but they took interest in what we were doing and rejuvenated our spirit after the first 400 miles. Their enthusiasm for their craft and spreading it others was felt. I know the bike basics but nothing more. Never once did these guys have an air about them. That is huge to me when I visit bike shops. Thanks guys for everything!~~#~1
Valentine's Day: Fabulous late lunch and service from Chelsea. Everything was very fresh and simply delicious. I loved the Roasted Beet salad. I wasn't disappointed that I forgot to get "dressing on the side". We love that this place is in the neighborhood and is a genuinely nice, quiet atmosphere with great healthy food. Hope Tryst can keep up in this economy. We plan to check out the breakfast too!~~#~1
this place is awesome i love that it is local! the lunch specials are amazing super fast and super cheap. the patio is beautiful :)~~#~1
As an attorney, I have needed to find a real estate company that can handle my client's needs. The Drummond Group has gone above and beyond what has been expected. They have helped manage properties for clients, helped others find homes and also worked with clients needing to sell their properties. Ed and Evan are great to work with. They follow through on what they promise. Also, if you have any questions whether a short sale is for you or not, these are the people to ask. They are up to date on all the different programs.~~#~1
Don't go to WH and expect 5* service, it's a DIVE DINER. You'll get "how ya' doin' hon", possible dirty table, people yelling across the place, sub-par water but again....it's a DIVE DINER! This is the same chain where Kid Rock got into a fist fight with another patron if that doesn't spell it out for you. This location was my first WH and the only one in Phoenix back in the day. You can imagine my squeals of delight when driving through Georgia, I saw a WH on every corner! Almost made me want to move there. Almost.This is one of those places that I love sober, it's that good. There's something about those cheese 'n eggs that screams illegal. Many have tried but nobody can replicate that taste or that texture with those eggs. Unadulterated heaven on a plate!Trust me my friend, get the cheese 'n eggs, hashbrowns covered and raisin toast (don't skimp on the apple butter). I don't do grits so I sub the grits for the hashies. Every once in a while, I walk on the wild side and get a waffle too. It IS the WAFFLE House afterall. I'm kinda glad we don't have these in San Diego because I'd probably weigh 1000lbs or be in the cardiac intensive care. Definitely my favorite breakfast. Or breakfast for dinner. Or 2am breakfast for drunkards.~~#~1
Better than the Zoolights for several different reasons - one, you don't have people in the parking lot trying to sell you crap for the kids, two, you have different artists performing live at different pavilions all over the museum, three, the food at the buffet dinner is way better than anything at Zoolights, four, you get to wander dark paths lighted only by luminarias through the different habitation zones of the desert and look at all the cool plants, smell the smells and just generally enjoy the night.  There are NA storytellers, carolers, jazz musicians, a steel band, mariachi's, and who knows what else.  Explore the dark paths for yourself and find out what awaits.There are a couple of vendors offering wine, it would be nice to see a microbrew or two as well :-)  Volunteers at every corner to help you in case you get lost trying to follow the lighted paths and it's just a darn cool place to be.  We went for the buffet, having a nice dinner, then strolling along the paths - it was a perfect December evening.~~#~1
Have lived here 7 years, moving back East in a month and just discovered Litchfield's (bar side). Friendly ladies behind the bar, nice drinks and delicious dinner right at the bar. The sweet corn soup is our favorite, along with the brown rice risotto -so savory with sweet potato and sweet corn and the steaks are delish. But the best part is Jay Soto - wonderful piano and smooth jazz artist plays Fri/Sat nites. Where can you find such world class delicious live smooth sounds but in Litchfield Park? How amazing and sorry we didn't discover this fact sooner. We've had two very enjoyable Friday evenings in a row here and will always remember this hidden gem and the fact we got to see a great artist in such a cozy venue.~~#~1
I have been a patient for over seven years and Dr. Pat Dietzgen is the best doctor I've ever had. Her and her staff are always comforting and caring and I can usually get an appointment right away when I'm sick. Her husband, Dr. Mark Dietzgen has helped me with acupuncture treatments and supplements. I would highly recommend their practice to anyone seeking a primary care doctor.~~#~1
Tried to get my oil change and tires rotated on my truck here today, but I decided against it because apparently one of their jacks is broken. That means that they only have one jack, which is being used all the time, which means that its probably about to break as well.  It's definitely not going to be my truck that falls to the ground when this jack breaks.  I also went to another Jiffy Lube near by on Apache and McClintock, same story.~~#~0
This is my go to place for a bottle of alcohol that I am gifting to someone, recommending someone to gift or celebrating with.The selection per square foot is quite impressive and the guys know their stuff quite well. They've tried a lot of what's in the store and when it comes to Tequila, have been the most helpful bunch every time I came in.Sidenote: sometimes the music choice is questionable :)~~#~1
The pizza here is delicious! Not greasy at all like other places. The cheesy bread sticks with marinara sauce is so amazing. This has got to be one of my favorite places to dine and have pizza. Service is great. Spinato's is basically the best pizza hands down.~~#~1
This place encompasses everything I desire in a venue. A solid beer/wine list, cool atmosphere and off the beaten path indie films will keep me coming back.  I first encountered FilmBar on First Friday, our first stop.  No one was in there, but it was early. We grabbed some beers from the friendly owner, checked out the theater and relaxed in the back.  I love the tranquil decor and my phone loved the availability of outlets. I returned for the Wednesday night showing of the Phil Ochs film.  A great film about a man with something to say!  I was once again greeted with friendly staff and an amazing deal.  A good beer and a movie for $8 (with Yelp discount)!  I must also profess my love for the bathrooms and how the sinks are outside of the bathroom.  Speeds up everything.  My date pointed out it also encourages hand washing, which is always good. They have snacks I have yet to try.  Only downside is no beers on tap, but I heard that might be changing soon?  Great place for a group of friends or a date!  To the owner/employees: I'm Scarlett.  You'll see me here a lot.  Thank you!~~#~1
jackie is the best groomer in the world!~~#~1
Yet another disappointing Asian establishment in AZ. I know Lees is a chain and maybe I just happened to be the unlucky customer but geeeeez!Skimped on my meat and veggies. Was only enough to fill half the sandwich.I ordered the grilled pork sandwich and also the BBQ pork. Both were dry... Meat was tough... No flavor... Sandwich was dry and the pickled carrots and radish tasted funny. Sad night :( went home and made salad rolls instead.~~#~0
This is the place to be when you need help finding ornaments for your christmas tree and gifts for your girlfriends :) staff is super friendly~~#~1
Just got back from Barrio Cafe a few minutes ago and I just have to say how much I loved it there before I fall into a deep food coma.Guacamole. Absolutely adored this guacamole, because I love when there's, well was it pomegranite seeds or cranberries (?), whatever it was..it just makes the guac a little sweeter and gives it a different taste. It was served with really thick baked tortilla chips.We accompanied this guac with a yummy sangria and my hubby had a margarita. Next, the Quesadilla Langosta Boraccha. This had garlic and tequila lobster on corn tortillas covered with Oaxacan cheese and another white cheese. The waitress couldn't be excited enough to have us try it, and I'm glad we ordered it because it was that good!Cochinita pibil - the achiote seasoning really set this 12 hour  slow roasted pork off!Enchilada del Mar - Oh-so-rich enchiladas with lobster, scallops and crab topped with queso de cabra!Since we live so far, I decided to order the Flan de mi Mami and Churros Rellenos. Yes, we could not help but order dessert too because we don't know our limits. Churros are perfect! The flan was thick, the right texture, consistency, and flavor (just like my best friend's mom from Guadalajara makes it)! Since we came on a Sunday, they had a guitarist playing from noon until 2pm. He played all traditional classic songs on his Spanish guitar. It felt "just right" being there. I can see what all the hype is about! It is on the pricer side so go here if you want something extra flavorful and with a different edge.~~#~1
I am really loving the Mission after a recent visit.  The margaritas are fantastic and the "skinny" one is strong and delicious.  Last visit, I had the duck empanadas which were delicious. Every time the atmosphere is really fun.  I will say inside can sometimes be a little loud so if you are having super serious conversation you might sit outside on one of the patios.~~#~1
Paul Padilla comes to my house every six or so months to service my RO system. I consider him a member of a dying breed - a repair person who takes pride in his work.When Paul comes over he's pleasant and charming. He's very tidy, emptying out the under-sink contents and making quick work of changing the filters and assuring that all parts are in good working order. He always shows me the filter (the worst part of the experience because it's always disgusting), cleans up after himself and takes all his trash with him. The only evidence he leaves is better tasting water.In contrast, other repair people I've had in the house have damaged floor tile, left their trash or other messes (one person actually left pounds of sawdust everywhere), they're rude, dismissive and often do a half-ass job. These people are at the opposite pole from my RO guy, Paul.Paul does a terrific job, he's reasonable and he gets to you within a day or two. Use his service, you'll be glad you did.~~#~1
This is hands down my favorite breakfast place to go to now.First of all, they have fresh coffee outside that you can help yourself to. Secondly, there will probably be a wait but it's worth it and you can sip on coffee, sit in a big chair and people watch outside.We had the bacon bloody marys which you seriously should try. Amazing!We had the Hangover sandwhich and Southwest Flannel Hash. Both were superb and I couldn't finish the Southwest Flannel Hash but it made for amazing leftovers the next morning. The vibe inside is very trendy and fun. I loved the friendly service we received and will be back again and again! :)~~#~1
*** Oh what a cool place this is!!! I was here for the Yelp event last April 16th and boy was it fun in here!!! They have a gigantic tree house you get to crawl, walk and enjoy!! All I have to say is, that I cannot wait to have children and bring them to this wonderful place!!! Extremely kid friendly and Adult friendly too!!  Have fun!!:)~~#~1
I loved Chuy's, their baja tacos will always be a fond memory for me.  This location is closed and probably will be forever.  They weren't playing by the rules.  Go across the street for some good eats.~~#~0
This little hole in wall joint never disappoints.  The food is good and the friendly service better.   The prices are reasonable. The pizza and wings special is great. 22 bucks and  some change for a large with 2 toppings and 30 wings!~~#~1
This people are amazing. Amy is so helpful and sweet and Kevin is a genius. My daughter's 2nd birthday cake was more beautiful than I ever imagines. And the cake was delicious, and not terribly expensive! I will be returning to A Piece of Cake for every occasion from now on!~~#~1
From what I have noticed, the people that leave online reviews seem more likely to post something negative about their experience. Usually their complaints tend to come from having unrealistic expectations in relation to their budget, waiting until the very last minute for a service and expecting everybody else to accommodate their "emergency", or they just have a negative attitude in general and project that out toward the world (which brings all sorts of issues their way). At least that's what the subtext suggests after reading some of these reviews. I have been around long enough to see how rude some people can be towards store employees. I just imagine these angry shoppers primed and fired-up to slam these stores online because they feel like they were treated poorly, when in reality it is all on them and their behavior. So I always take negative reviews with a grain of salt. I think it takes a lot more for somebody to write a positive review, so I pay more attention to those.That said, I would like to leave an A+ review for Fuchsia. My wife has enjoyed their spa for a few years now and has always had a great experience. On occasion, I have even got a few massages, which were superb. Recently, I turned to Fuchsia for a few of my wife's Christmas presents and was not let down. A young woman named Lisa (she may have been the owner) helped me find the perfect gifts for my wife. She was super nice and very helpful; as was the entire staff. Needless to say, the gifts were a big hit at Christmas. My wife got really excited to see the brown and fuchsia Fuchsia bag. It is weird to think a local business played a part in our family Christmas, but Fuchsia did. We will continue go to Fuchsia. Also, Fuchsia is a local business. When given the choice, I will always support local small businesses over the large cookie-cutter chains. Fuchsia continues to impress us and we will continue to take advantage of their services and products. If you are looking to try something different and unique, give Fuchsia a try. You will love this place!~~#~1
chicken pho and veggie spring rolls? oh, yeah baby~~#~1
Clean is at the top of my list and this passes on that first point.  First timers be prepared to ask about the ordering process.  They don't make it clear and have so many regulars. As you are feeling relief from having just scored a parking spot, you walk in not quite prepared for the process of ordering. I told the cashier I was new to their restaurant and asked several questions the first two times: Where do I pick up my order? What cold teas do you offer? May I sit anywhere? How do I access the wi-fi? May I park across the street? Where can I get a re-fill? First cashier was a bit annoyed, but second was very helpful. I have regularly returned for the consistent good food since moving to the Biltmore area. My husband has commented on the portion size, but he likes his breakfasts hearty.LGO has certainly carved out a niche with the locals and I will continue to enjoy it for what it is - a neighborhood gathering spot that serves a consistent menu of quality choices.~~#~1
I've gotten sick from this food a few times. The worst food option in park central~~#~0
Haji-baba I love you!Best middle eastern food!!! :)I came here last week 3 times for the chicken shawarma plate and kabob. If I lived in Arizona I would have to come here at least once a week... it's that good!Reasonable prices, casual dining and friendly service!Stress free parking!If I ever visit Arizona again... HAJIBABA will be first on the the list!If you live in the area or visiting Arizona... and love middle eastern food... you have to eat here!Arizona I'm so jealous!I'm a fan!-Miss Yelp 2012~~#~1
Our "go to" Chinese place. Always great food and service!~~#~1
Nowhere else like it. If you're interested in getting out of the common "virtual office" locations such as where they serve burnt flavored coffee and call it Seattle's finest, try this place. It's got decent coffee and smoothies, fun bikes to ride around, reminiscent rocker music and free internet; besides you can hit two birds with one stone- quick cup of joe and a bike light (you know you can get a bike ticket without one at night, man).~~#~1
Excellent. Loved the bread and the gumbo. Great outdoor seating. Great staff.~~#~1
Worse food and service I've ever experienced. Extremely rude people work here!They were busy and a nasty waitress added drinks we never even ordered then was rude when we questioned her. She removed the drinks then was a complete bitch! I suggest you pay as you order for drinks or really check your bill before you pay!~~#~0
Since being redone, Kitchen 56 has got it perfect.  It's a great casual dining experience, not uptight at all.  The indoor,outdoor bar is great for nighttime summer dining.  I love wall mural of the old gas station that used to occupy the space.  When I think of service at a casual place, I really focus on speed.  As I sat down at the bar, my drink was on the way and the menu was there.  After ordering, my food was out in less than 10 minutes.  That's about as good as you can get for casual dining.  Especially with the quality of food. The food was amazing.  I've been here 3 times and each time I tried something new.  Last time I had the burger and it was tasty.  I like the seasoning on the fries as well.  The first time I had the handmade parpardelle with slow roasted pork sauce (comfort food galore).  They've made the parking easy and I think it's perfect for a quick stop on the way home from work.  I can't wait till it cools off to sit in the lounge seats outside and play some ping-pong!~~#~1
This branch is right down the street from where I work.  It comes in handy when my computer at home is acting up.  I have been coming here about every 2 days or so for the past couple weeks.  They have a good amount of computers.  Some are Express, which means their only for 15 minutes and others allow you to stay on for an hour.  There's hardly ever a wait to use a computer.  If you need to print something, it's 25 cents per page, which isn't that bad.  Faxing is free.  There's also several areas where you can sit down and get some work done.  I haven't looked at their book/cd/dvd collections yet, but from what I can tell, there is a wide variety.~~#~1
My hubby and I had a great time here last night celebrating Christmas in July so I thought it was time to write an update.  SanTan Brewery has pretty much become our favorite place to hang out.  The food is good, the staff is great, and the beers are fantastic!  Some of the items on the menu are just OK but the real stars are the appetizers.  Our favorites are the nachos and the hummus.  Either of these could easily be a meal in and of themselves.  If you do order an entree you usually can't go wrong with whatever the daily special is.  Also, all the pizzas and burgers that we have tried have been really yummy.  But my favorite things to order are the grilled cheese or street tacos.  The servers are all very knowledgeable of the menu and also passionate about the beer.  They can make good recommendations on both fronts if you tell them what your preferences are and can usually offer ideas on pairings.This place has a very chill vibe during the day.  It is a great spot for some relaxing day drinking, especially in the spring or fall when they roll up the big ice house style doors... so creating that inside, outside feeling.  They do have a kids menu but I have never seen any families here no matter what time it is.  Usually in the afternoon it is couples of all ages grabbing a bite while enjoying some shopping in downtown Chandler or else groups of friends just hanging out.  At night, it gets much more lively.  They frequently have a band or DJ starting at 10pm or so but even before that it can get so loud that it is difficult to carry on a conversation.  That is probably my only complaint about this place.  The concrete floors and lots of hard surfaces make the acoustics horrible.  Usually in the late evenings you will see more large, sometimes rowdy groups of 30-somethings occupying the tables and lots of singles of both genders milling around the bar.  Often on Friday or Saturday nights it is standing room only unless you call ahead for a table.  The servers are usually nice enough to bring drinks to those in the hostess area, so if you do get stuck waiting for a table it is not so bad.  They also use a smart system of taking your cell number instead of giving you a pager.  So, you can wander around the shops down the street instead, if you so desire, without fear of going out of range.  This is especially useful during the Thursday Farmers' Market, Third Friday Art Walk or other events put on by downtown Chandler.I really just can't say enough good things about this place.  I am leaving so much out in this review but check out their website if you want to see more about the cool events they do like Movie Mondays, trivia games, local bands and weekly guest beers.  You can also find more information about their beers which I think are by far the best craft brews produced in this state.  They have been really overlooked but are finally starting to get some recognition.  Don't take my word for it, though, get in there and try them for yourself.~~#~1
What a great place to eat! My brother and I have had lunch here a couple of times and the food has been excellent both times.We tried the alligator bits. As cliche' as it may sound, it "tastes like chicken".Although people always make fun of me for it, I like catfish. I ordered the blackened catfish with dirty rice and it was excellent. Portions are very large and I couldn't finish my meal (although not for lack of trying). My brother had the tilapia on one occasion and a mixed seafood dish on another. Both were great.The seafood tastes fresh, the location is great and the service staff is friendly. Also, I love the patio in the entrance area. Highly recommended.~~#~1
Between the great and friendly staff, their knowledge of wines and a constantly creative complement of unique beers, MWC is the perfect place to end the day.  Great food, live music and a fantastic patio for when the weather is perfect, like right now!~~#~1
This was definitely the best pizza I have ever experienced and I have had great pizza in LA, NY, and various cities in Italy. I came to AZ for four days and I ended up eating here two of those days. I waited over 2 hours the first time and four hours the second time. It was well worth the wait. All of the ingredients were the best quality, the crust was thin yet soft, and the bread was awesome. I ended up trying four different pizzas and all were amazing. The wait is bearable if you drink at the bar next door or the English pub across from it. You can call at intervals to check back for the approximate wait time, so you can venture out pretty much anywhere in the area while you wait. Just make sure to get there a 1/2 hour before you get called in. And make sure you go with people you enjoy hanging out with for more than a short while!~~#~1
How does this place seriously not have any Yelp reviews?! Craziness. Went here for the first time today and saw a PA, Christina Cousins... she is awesome! She takes the time to explain things and answers any questions very thoroughly. She is also not a pill pusher at all, makes sure you are totally comfortable taking medications and you know what they are  before she prescribes them. So, while I can't speak for any other PA's or MD's here, I can say that she made a dreaded doctors visit very pleasant.~~#~1
Laura Smith is THE best brow lady in town. I'm extremely picky about my brows and after having them botched more than once by others I'm so happy I've found Laura. She creates the perfect brow shape using hard wax which is gentle on sensitive skin. My brow area used to be red and irritated for hours after waxing but I no longer have that issue since seeing Laura. I receive a lot of compliments on my brows and I owe it to Laura!~~#~1
Awesome!  Pear dessert is off the chain!  Owner is a trip!  We loved it:-)~~#~1
I've been to better Outbacks in the ghetto's of Detroit.  Went once, ordered prime rib...ordered it med rare, it came out gray.  Server NEVER came back.  Wife finished meal, went to hostess stand and asked for manager.  Manager apologized, didn't take plate away.  Server came back and I asked her to get this plate out of my site.  She told me not to be angry, she had other tables.  My food was comped, got a $25 gift card, left hungry.  Gave card to a friend.  I'll never go to a chain steak place again.  I was also told by a former Outback manager that Downtown Scottsdale Outback is one of the lowest rated Outback's in the country.  Go figure.~~#~0
The Commons makes amazing coffees, teas, and fruit smoothies that are not full of HFCS! The staff is personable and the prices are just right. They also have sandwiches and cookies. Great atmosphere to just hang out between services and fellowship with friends!~~#~1
Damn this place was good!  It was so good that even though I was craving decent Mexican food after living in DC and working in Indiana, I was convinced by the smells emanating from this choice spot.We had the Mediterranean sampler (top notch baba ganoush! and local olives) and the mushroom, truffle oil, and elephant garlic pizza.  Amazing.  The sangria was good, along with the Margaritas.  The staff was quick, efficient, and friendly.  You even get a bomb-ass iron skillet cookie ice cream if you check in online via the Yelp app.  Ugh!~~#~1
This is a great family owned restaurant. great wine selection particularly the new Pinot from jwrigley vineyards. You will not be disappointed.~~#~1
We had girls night out last Saturday and were so impressed by Lucky Strike.  The vibe was good, the service was good, and the staff was friendly.  We had a reservation for 7 to bowl and checked in and got our clean bowling shoes without a hitch.Awesome drink specials from 9-close - $2 domestic drafts, $3 well drinks, and $4 house wine.  I was a little put off by the sign out front about the dress code - no "colors", motorcycle wear, construction boots, or cut-offs.  This place was pretty classes and I just hope it stays that way.  Great place to celebrate a birthday or take a group.  Awesome DJ with VIDEOS (I love that) and pool tables.:)~~#~1
Popped in here on a whim one day, and wandered around for a bit.  Didn't actually want to really touch much of anything, I felt like I was in that show "Hoarders" but the hoarder had OCD....so it was slightly organized filthy crap.The furniture in the back looked so sad, I can't imagine any other Goodwill in the valley accepting it.  Most of it looked like it had been scavenged from next to dumpsters.I did end up buying a few of the bags of cloth they have, but only because they are for sewing projects and I knew I could dump them in the washer and sterilize the crap out of them when I got home.  I love going to thrift stores, but this was slumming at a level I could not have imagined.~~#~0
One of the worst hotels I stayed in anywhere.  During my spring training visit earlier this year, almost every day I had trouble with the door key cards.  Very poor decor also.~~#~0
We ordered a couple pizzas tonight via their on-line system and were given an estimated delivery time of about 25 minutes.  We thought this sounded quite short but were willing to give them a little leeway.  After they missed the estimated delivery time by 45 minutes I called to see what the status of our pizza was.  Alexa or Alexis (not sure which) answered the phone and as soon as she pulled up our order she started apologizing profusely, she put me on hold and after a few minutes another person answered the phone with much more of a gruff voice, didn't say anything except "this is ???? (didn't catch name).  I figured the phone had been picked up by someone else so I told her I was talking to the other person.  She told me she was the manager and that the driver said he tried to deliver the pizza and the woman that answered the door told him they already got their pizza?!?!Since it's my wife and I that were home, both expecting the pizza and both irritated that it hadn't arrived there is no way that happened at this house.  I couldn't tell if the driver messed up terribly or if this was their cover story for messing up our order and not getting it out.Granted...they did offer to recook the pizzas and deliver them for free but at this point they are done in my book.  The last thing I want is a pizza cooked and delivered by disgruntled people.  This is the last time we will ever attempt to get a pizza from them and highly recommend you use caution when ordering.~~#~0
I have been to BLD's multiple times before and was pretty satisfied with the food. But my most recent one has to be put up. My girlfriend and I went to lunch on Saturday just as the kitchen was being staffed for their dinner menu. We ordered off the happy hour menu, a pita pizza and 2 burgers. Apparently though, during the kitchen change, our burger order got lost. The pizza came out in about 10 minutes (prosciutto with goat cheese and veggies, pretty good), but our burgers took about 35 minutes more. Now I have had my food delayed before but at most they give a free beverage. BLDs staff went all out. They gave a complimentary beverage to start. The burgers arrived and were fantastic, the spicy one having a nice kick to it and the goat cheese one being very flavorful. On top of that, the chef come out and apologized with a parfait dessert. At the end of our meal, the manager picked up the tab as well.I have waited longer for much lower quality in food and not had the great service as I did here. The food being great on top of that. I will definitely be bringing more people here for their happy hour menu.~~#~1
Their Filet Mignon Cobb is my all time favorite there, its already perfectly tossed in dressing and is a meal.. not bird food by any means. I have also tried their mushroom/chicken crepes and Im not a crepes fan and I was more than impressed. Great place for a date or just meeting a friend out for a bite. Its swanky yet you won't feel uncomfortable dressed down. Not pretentious and the waitstaff is fantastic. My only complaint is on their mashed potatoes..too much oil and they're whipped to death.. but hey i like mine with lumps..so it's a preference thing.~~#~1
We started going to the "BIRD" as we call it starting the second week that it first opened. As time went on they just kept getting better and better. We would go sometimes 2-4 time a week. Then they changed owners, but wanting to give the new owners a chance we went a few more times. In our opinion it went down the flusher. They starting changing certain items trying to go on the cheap. Too bad. Why people buy a successful business then change things I don't know. The killer for us was on our 4th retry the bacon was no longer nice full pieces, they were shriveled up tiny pieces that would fit inside a teaspoon spoon. We said that's enough. Too bad. Several other friends that we had recommended to go there in the beginning has also quit going due to their changes. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME !!!DON, VICKIE, & ANDREW~~#~0
You seriously cannot go wrong if you've wound up at this place.  Everything on the menu is simply fantastic.  When I finally ventured to have lunch here I got blown away by the grilled chicken sandwich.  Its really small though so you usually have to wait.  And its so small you usually have to wait outside.  Because its so small.~~#~1
Went to North with my family of 11, including the under 7 crowd. We had a good table near the kitchen, so the kids (and adults) could watch the pasta being made. Everything I tasted was really good, including:o Raviolini, pork with lemon preserves tastes so fresh.o Tortelinnio roast porko beet salad, also,with a hint of lemono short ribs w/ gnocchi Save room for dessert! The budino, salted caramel and bombolini (essentially donuts) we're fabulous.The wait staff was very attentive and good. The ambience was modern and not pretentious, with a good mix of families and others.Definitely would go back.~~#~1
The restaurant is vegetarian heaven.  My wife and I tried a couple of wraps, one with side salad and one with quinoa pilaf, and a salad with chickpeas and tomatoes with tahini dressing, and a large batch of hot herb tea, which is served in a French press.  The salad came with some amazing bread, an olive bread and a cranberry/raisin bread, which they said is from Simply Bread (I asked, it was that good).  It was all very delicious and inspires me to try to make some similar dishes at home.  The total was just under $50, but it was way too much food; next time we will probably just share one wrap ($13) and one salad (varies).  The tea is a good deal, $6 for a large or $2 for a small, and they put such a large quantity of herbs in it that I think at their prices for herbs, the cost would probably be about the same if you made it yourself.  There are many varieties to choose from, which they mix up themselves, with various therapeutic properties.As for buying herbs, they have everything, and as others have mentioned it's probably a good place to get some herbal advice, but the herbs are quite pricey.  After the Gentle Strength Coop was kicked out of their old digs and subsequently failed, there hasn't been much choice, but you can get a few bulk herbs cheaper at Sprouts (much fewer, actually).  I wish there was a cheaper option in this area of town, with a comparable selection.An example... my wife likes to make tea from linden leaves ( in Russian).  In her home town, these trees line the streets; they are as ubiquitous as oleanders are here.   At Chakra 4, the leaves are sold for multiple dollars per ounce.  It's hard to believe they don't grow in abundance nearby too, perhaps in another state.  Somebody is making a lot of money from something which is not a scarce resource at all.  But not enough people are into such diverse types of farming or collecting/packaging, so that's what we have to put up with.I really like the old Town & Country mall, and I hope it continues to survive.  Chakra 4 is also a valuable resource in this neighborhood.~~#~1
I love pizza.  I really don't have a better way to start a review other than me sharing my love for pizza.  Meat, cheese, and carbs all put together that also acts as its own servicing dish just seems genius to me.  I love Vincent's Pizza but their delivery service is awful.  I recommend either eating there or ordering pick up.Meal:  I usually order the smallest of the sizes, with Italian sausage and fresh mozzarella and cannolis.   Taste:  Vincent's has the best pizza and awesome cannolis.  Their pizza is New York style and has the right amount of "floppiness" to it.  Their ingredients seems to be top notch and fresh.  This is the real deal pizza.  10 out of 10.Value:  This is expensive pizza, but I am probably the wrong the person to ask about this because once I find a pizza I love, I will pay almost anything for it.  I wish they did serve a smaller size pizza for individuals (the fiance doesn't care for New York style pizza), so that means you end up having a bunch of left over pizza. 2 out of 5.Service/Cleanliness:  Here is why they got one star.  Their customer service is awful, awful, awful! If you ask for a pizza to be delivered, it takes well over two hours . . . even though they will wuote you that it will take a little over an hour.  One two separate occasions, the price given over the phone ends up being lower what you have to pay when it arrives to the door.  And finally, ever single time you call them asking 'where the heck is my pizza', the managers/owner always throw their own people under the bus instead of stepping up to the plate and being accountable.  Service at the physical restaurant isn't that much better either.  0 out of 10.Atmosphere:  Very generic decorating.  Can't remember if there was music.  Could use a major overhaul.  1 out of 5.Overall:  If the service wasn't so god awful, they would be my go to pizza place in the valley.  The taste is absolutely amazing . . . . it is in my top 3 pizza places.  But the service is so completely awful, the taste isn't work it.  13 points out of 30, 5 out of 5 stars.~~#~0
The Crescent Ballroom is one of the best concert venues in Phoenix. The set up is great, you walk in to a nice modern dining area where you can have pre-drinks and food before entering in to the actual venue. The Ballroom itself is small, but well set up with stadium seating along the walls. The  under 21 area is also small and doesn't take away from the viewing pleasure of all the drunkards like some other places. I have yet to try the food, but they do $5 beer and burritos on Fridays and I have heard rave reviews. This place rocks and I hope it stays this way. We need more venues like this in Phoenix!~~#~1
Great little sandwich shop!  Smallish portions, but that's ok by me.  Good prices, nice variety.  Delicious cookies:)~~#~1
We ate here before going to see the Sharks/Coyotes game in March. It was busy- most likely because of the biker rally and the hockey game- but we were seated in a reasonable amount of time. I ordered a chicken ceasar salad which was very boring and run of the mill. I actually didn't eat the chicken at all just because there wasn't any flavoring on it and it was cold chicken. Perhaps if it was warm it would have been palatable. About halfway through the meal I started to feel incredibly sick and started to get a headache. I realized once we were done that a lightbulb high on the ceiling right above our table was flickering and it made me sick. I did not bring my migraine medication with me to dinner and was forced to sit through a hockey game with a terrible upset stomach and migraine. Needless to say it pretty much ruined the game. I would hope that the management would take better care of the building.~~#~0
Brand new. Just opened. Clean and put together nice. I'm sure the items will be better here than the West Valley seeing its in Scottsdale. Busy parking lot. Come early. Usually Thursdays are the stock days.~~#~1
I came in contact with this company via Home Depot. Communication was horrible. My quote came a week later than they said and after I emailed them did it come a day later. When I had questions, I received a brief answer. I felt after 3 attempts of clarifying the quote, that I was pulling teeth to get information. It really shouldn't be that way!!I guess I'm of the frame of mind that when someone wants to do business, they try to be as professional and upfront as they can. That they try to "wow" the customer with information so that they can make a decent and informed decision. After all, I would be the person "paying them!" The way I figure it, if a company can't perform very simple basic follow up, follow through and professional communication at the start, they're not going to be successful in managing a landscaping project until the end making sure that the customer is happy. Look, they obviously did a few things right back in 2008 from the other reviews, but they are not doing so well right now. I passed on their services happily and knowing that I just saved myself a huge mega headache.~~#~0
I love this restaurant. Great lunch specials and a huge menu. Lot's of sushi specials. Fast service and a great lunch staff. Will definatley be back. Best kept secret in Phoenix. Express lunch service during the day and wait service in the evening. Several wines to choose from, also Sake and Japanese beers. Good happy hour specials 3 to 6 and 8:30 to closing.~~#~1
CLOSED?!?!?! Maaaaaan. I pretty much moved downtown JUST to get coffee here....well....maybe that's not true.....but seriously? I am sooo sad this place closed because it is some fine coffee and pastries. I have dreams about their chocolate cupcakes. I went the other day with a friend and they were unusually closed, but no sign....then returned a few days later to see their door covered in paper. Their sign says they are looking to relocate somewhere else in downtown sometime this winter, which I hope is true. Hey Royal! You can open in the open space under the Alta lofts or in the Arizona center if you wanna....just sayin....~~#~1
Love, love, love Hana.  We don't go here super often but everytime we do we say the same thing....".why don't we come here more?"  The service has always been great and the staff super welcoming.   We usually do a cornucopia of sides.  The salad with the avocado and shaved parmesean, californai rolls, a noodle dish and the marinated pork appetizer.....yum and $34.00!    Enough for 3 but 2 of us ate it.We took some friends their for lunch who lived for years in the San Juan Islands....experts on 'fresh fish'.  They loved it.   The Bento lunch boxes are great and there are so many to pick from."Sometimes you wanna go where everybody knows your name" and Hana is the neighborhood place to try.   The BYOB is a nice touch and that doesn't seem to be changing.  You can get served outside now and even take you wine out there.  It's a little lackluster out there but gives that kind of 'urban feel' to your evening.Plan to wait on Friday and Saturday and I wouldn't suggest a group inside....tight space.~~#~1
Oh my god! five stars only because of their waffles with bananas ice cream and caramel! to die for! I came here for vacation and i would go back to arizona for these waffles! I love the idea of breakfast and dessert. This restaurant was packed when we went. It was around 11-12 noon ish on a Sunday. The wait for 5 was about 30 minutes. Its funny though because i was standing right by the hostess stand and they kept telling everyone who came in the wait was 15 minutes. They told us that thats why we stayed to wait. It worked though we waited. If she had told us 30 mintues we probably would have left because we were hungry. If was pretty obvious though that the wait would be long the waiting room was packed (which is pretty big to begin with) and the outside was packed too. They also have good OJ. They make it themselves.~~#~1
When I was at Pizzeria Bianco, the second in line peeps mentioned that I try Matt's Big Breakfast. I had also saw the episode on Triple D with Guy Fieri and the dude raved that this was his fave. Now I had already put it on the "must go" list and then asked for recommendations. I was told to expect an hour wait, order the waffles or griddlecakes and the pork rib chop. Good info...It was ambitious of us to want to wake up early to have Matt's, but we did eventually get there, even with the stoopid Android GPS getting us lost at First Ave and not First St. We had made a few passes around the block and saw the farmer's market diagonally from Matt's. I dropped off Kathy to put our names down, parked in the lot and headed over to the farmer's market. Now, you couldn't plan this any better, but the market is open Sat and Weds, so what better way to kill time, instead of sitting in heat? After about 40 mins, we headed back and got called immediately.We got in and ordered waffles with a side of the griddlecakes, since Kathy couldn't decide. I went for the pesto crusted pork rib chop with home fries that were Yukon gold potatoes grilled with rosemary and onions and two eggs over easy. The batter used for both the waffles/griddlecakes were light and fluffy and when you factor in the homemade whipped butter and authentic Vermont maple syrup, the combination is Dyno-mite! My pork rib chop was tender and moist and the Yukon gold fries were absolutely perfect. The thick toast with a side of peach marmalade was delicious. I'm stoked they use locally grown produce, as that ensures that the food is always tip top. The super thick bacon that came with the waffles were just perfect balance of salt and savor. Simply bueno!I'm always in awe of the other reviewers who were expecting some Iron Chef to blow them away with spectacular gourmet food. To do the basic breakfast items and take them to another level should be spectacular in itself. I highly recommend Matt's Big Breakfast for simplistic elegance and for breakfast that truly did deserve Guy Fieri's adulation.Housekeeping items: Go Saturdays, so you can check out the Farmer's Market with all the free and tasty samples. That should keep you busy as your name floats to top of the wait list. The wait staff wants to turn over tables, so other Yelpers can get in and eat too. Stay hungry my friends and happy eatings...~~#~1
The McManager sucks.  (he wouldn't run his store Safeway card for me!)The debit/credit card swipers suck! (they don't fit in their holders and they must use a freakin' dialup modem they are so God Damn slow)They once completely ran out of MILK!Their change machine was down for well over a week!I swear to God, if  there were any alternative in the vicinity I'd GLADLY pay twice the price to shop there! Revamped store is nice to look at, shitty to shop at!  Now with free Wi-Fi! EAT ME!~~#~0
Great place! One of the few places in Phoenix with a good indoor temperature. Good food, low prices, tv screens.. Great for weekend lunch!~~#~1
I HATE JACK IN THE CRACK...the only time I can eat here is if I've been drinking and everyone in the car is craving it. Not like I got a say I never drink and drive :) so when we all pull up my drunken ass orders something. THIS PARTICULAR jack just is horrible!!!! The past 3 times!!! Drinks get mixed up...fries are missing...tomatos are there when they shouldn't...foods cold...forget my sauce for the eggrolls :( ya don't judge i tried the eggrolls and they were horrible and dry. And it's really hard to make eggrolls taste bad ,but jack in the box sure was able to do it.~~#~0
Yummy! I visited the Smashburger in Tempe for the first time last week, and it's delicious! Due to it's proximity to ASU, they offer a student discount which includes a classic smashburger, smashfries and a drink for $7.50. The classic smashburger comes with the regular crowd- lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles, lettuce and tomatos. But this ain't your momma's burger, it's huge and delicious!! And the smashfries are made with rosemary and garlic and are completely addicting! If you're in the mood for a burger, but want to try something new, you have to check out Smashburger! They're popping up all over the valley- so chances are, there's one in your neighborhood.~~#~1
NEVER AGAIN! (at least not for me...this is a hotel for a different crowd)For me, the best part about this hotel was that happy hour, which lasts until 8 serves $5 glasses of decent wine.  But you can get that without having to stay here overnight.I arrived to work being done on the outside of the hotel - apparently some rain damaged the drywall (huh?) so had to drive around the side to park, where there is nobody to direct you to where the front desk is, or heaven forbid be there to help you haul your bags up a flight of stairs.  Later I learned that the elevator down there wasn't just for parking - it could have taken me to the lobby, so again it would've been nice if there was sombody down there to let a newcomer know what is where.  Not much in the way of hospitality - but then again, this is a glorified Holiday Inn.The lobby is okay in that it's very bright, clean and somewhat hip.  The bar is off to the side where there is also a nice outdoor lounge.  Like other Yelpers, I was a little confused by the two computers in the bar acting as the business center, but whatever.My room was pretty nice.  I liked the retro, mid century look and feel.  This hotel's big selling point was the hard wood floors but in my opinion, the floors were a HUGE mistake.  Firstly, they are cheap laminate, not hard wood and anybody can tell.  But worst of all, the floors make sound travel from room to room!  I was able to hear everything next to me and above me.  And on this random Wednesday night, my floor and the floor above me was an all night party - I mean college kids running up and down the halls like crazy people, doors slamming (and I mean SLAMMING) and what sounded like a game of marbles above my head  This went on until 4 in the morning..  I think that the low price point and hipsterish feel here makes it the perfect place for a twentysomething crowd, but not a business traveler like me.  Free internet and parking does not make up for the circles under my eyes.  So bottom line is, if I were 22 and partying with my friends, this would be a fantastic hotel.  For work or a romantic weekend in Scottsale, notsomuch.~~#~0
OMG--I love this place.  My new AZ friends host an annual Mardi Gras party with a live band and I received my invite at the end of December, reminding me to start thinking about a costume.  I had no idea what to wear and decided to find a costume shop online for ideas.Easley's presented itself as the only real option that was close (even though it took 40 mins to get there from Surprise) and boasted a host of costumes that could be rented or purchased.  This was great for 2 reasons--I didn't want to buy a costume that I'd only wear for 1 night if it were going to cost more than $30 and didn't have the time/patience to throw something together as I heard many of the past partygoers suggest.  (I do have a normal day job & sewing is not one of my domestic skills!)Upon arrival, the storefront looked smaller than I imagined.  I assumed it would be like a Costco warehouse b/c there were so few costume stores in the Phoenix area, and if this were 'it' for costume stores, I just thought it would be aisles and aisles of costumes where I might have to push around one of those oversized carts and then buy a polish hotdog afterward b/c I'd be so famished from shopping.  But that was not the case.In this compact little space, they organized the store very well and utilized every possible inch of wall space to display what they didn't have room for on the floor.  Since Mardi Gras was a few weeks away when I was shopping, they had racks of rental costumes and an entire section with accessories.  I found what I needed quickly--a floor length cape for $25 and a huge gold crown.  It was perfect.  (Please note, that although the Mardi Gras costumes were my main concern & the focus of this post, they had a ton of other things in there).While I was waiting in line, I couldn't help but notice how many different varieties of bunny head masks they had for rent.  There must have been about 15 different bunny heads mounted on display.  Who knew bunny costume renters would be so particular about the facial features on a bunny head....?~~#~1
Finally, a coffee place you can brag about going to.Cartel is an intelligent coffee shop with trendy decor and knowledgeable baristas. I feel good about being there, like I've chosen wisely for not going to a run-of-the-mill coffee-bucks type establishment. Though I sometimes feel out of my element because I don't know a lot about coffee, I've always been treated with courteous and attentive customer service.By the way, major bonus points for using an iPad to place orders and being able to text or email you the receipt. Why don't more places do that?The Espresso is strong with a solid kick and does the trick. I like how they serve it in a mug instead of a paper cup. The Chai Latte is also phenomenal. As good, if not better than ones I've had elsewhere.  I'm impressed by the various coffee beans and accessories they offer too. I even purchased the Aeropress so I can make coffee like them (and because of the great reviews: http://www.amazon.com/Aerobie-AeroPress-Coffee-Espresso-Maker/dp/B0047BIWSK). *Be sure to buy it from the store, though*Looking forward to trying out their food and BEER selections soon. But, even if they only served coffee, I'd be more than happy.Definitely check out their Tempe location for a very hipster hole-in-the-wall ambiance that reminds me of drinking coffee in a place like Chicago or NYC: http://www.yelp.com/biz/cartel-coffee-lab-tempe~~#~1
Good as it gets! We all know arizona aint know socal! But this boba establishment is really yummy! and the works are always friendly~~#~1
Best tacos I've ever had, hands down.  Also the smallest, but that's okay because they were so damn good.  They were perfect.The Mission does a wonderful job of combining various Latin cultures' cuisine into a dish to make it their own.  I got the chicken tacos, which sounds boring, but they were extraordinary.  They are served with an aji amarillo sauce.  Aji is a common Peruvian pepper, which has a wonderful and unique flavor, but I've never seen it on tacos before, since tacos aren't part of Peru's cuisine.  That's what I love about this place--they married the Mexican and Peruvian cultures and made something delightful out of the union.  I can't wait for an opportunity to go back and try their arepas.  The pabellon has my mouth watering already!~~#~1
OMG. I cannot believe we didn't know this place existed until tonight. Delicious!!! We had the Mexican Hot Chocolate and the Pineapple & Raspberry Paletas. They were SO GOOD. The chocolate one was so creamy and cinnamon-y - it was rich and a perfect balance of flavors. The pineapple one tasted like biting into a fresh pineapple. It was heavenly. We will definitely be making this a regular stop - especially as the summer creeps in! The paletas are about $2.50 each. Cash only.~~#~1
Chocolate and peanutbutter are my favorite.~~#~1
Never been to a better Hooters in my life. I am originally from Ft. Lauderdale Florida and have been to just about every Hooters in the area. Not a single one of them compares. Yes one on Ft Lauderdale is on the beach and has a nice view.....of the beach. I'd rather the view at this Hooters. I swear to god every single girl there is sexy and actually lives up to the restaurants name.....Hooters. The food is the same everywhere you go but besides for the chicken wings, why else go to Hooters? Love this Hooters and look forward to wing wednesdays every week. If you havent been I strongly suggest going. Happy Valentines Day!!~~#~1
Excellent with one big caveat which I'll save till the end.First, why five stars?  The foremost reason is the place (ie atmosphere).  One of the things I miss about San Francisco (just moved to Phoenix in Summer of 2010) are the small eateries with lots of personality.  They are difficult to find in this area.  Well, Cafe Monark fits that description perfectly.  Very small tucked away nicely in a quiet corner in the Oldtown.  The owner is the greeter, chef, waiter and cashier.  The place only has about 20 seats.The food is excellent and from what I can tell the set menu changes regularly.Lastly, it's BYOB with a $10 corkage.So, for the caveat, it can be slow.  That what makes it unique (run completely by the owner) can make it slow.  However, come with a nice bottle or two and enjoy the place.  The food is worth the wait and the experience is certainly unique.~~#~1
Yum. Yum.  Yum.     The burritos here are awesome, as are the sope's, the service is super-friendly and it makes for a great quick lunch or dinner.      My girlfriend absolutely loves this place and I've become a fan as well.     Good food, good prices, good service, I'm there, and I'll be back, again and again.    Their flan is terrific and the selection of tortas and burro's is outstanding as well.     Give this place a shot, you won't regret it, beats the pants off the gringo fast-food establishments like Taco Bell.~~#~1
There are no car washes in the area except this one. You have to put exact change in the machine, and it never takes bills. You have to go inside to get a code to use the wash, which is inconvenient! Why doesn't the machine want to take your money, I have no clue. This car wash could be making a lot of money given it's location, but it's junk. I will never give this gas station my money again.~~#~0
Truly an Oasis in the Desert!! Nutritious and satisfying - every cell in my body was applauding the meals we have had here. Chef Sarah comes out to greet her costumers in person and truly care about your well-being and experience while dining. Everyone working here contributes to the ambiance. P.s: To prepare these foods takes time...., is the freshest and tastiest I have had and we live in the Bay area CA where fresh produce is abundant! I will pay the dollar amount over and over again.~~#~1
WooHoo!!!!!!  This was so much fun.  My wife and I and a friend went here Friday night around 8pm and the place was packed.  We had a seat at the sushi bar in the middle in front of the fish case.  Paul the sushi chef was so much fun to talk too and laugh with.  The food coming across the bar for others in the restaurant looked amazing and every time we ohoooo'ed & Awwwwww'ed as we gazed upon each item.We ordered several items.  The crazy boy roll, the Philadelphia roll, the shrimp tempura roll, the calamari roll, the rock & roll roll, and some tuna sushi, & smelt row.  We started with creamy shrimp  These amazing little wantons filled with shrimp and cream cheese with a wasabi cocktail sauce.  Oh my these were yummy.  I am hesitant to write this review because there are so many already on Yelp telling how good this place is and I don't want it to be so crowed when I go that I have to wait for ever to get a table or seat at the bar but this place tops and they deserve props for putting out amazing food and having great personalities at the bar and since we are in a recession I don't want to see them struggle.  So save some dough and hit this place up on your next night out or your next date night.  You wont be disappointed.  The outside does not do the inside justice.  The decor is so warm and inviting and makes you feel like your in a little mom and pop restaurant in Japan but then you walk out side and find yourself back in reality and on bell road.It's a nice escape.~~#~1
I need to update my review of Blue Fin. This place absolutely rocks; that's probably why you can find me eating lunch here 4 out of 5 weekdays, seriously. I haven't ever had a bad experience here after finding this gem and cannot speak higher of everything about they provide. Service, quality and freshness of food, as well as value, cannot be found elsewhere.~~#~1
I love this place. The prices are fair and the food is great. I was able to get Pho for breakfast at 8am on a Friday morning. I brought my mother here after an appointment at St. Joes hospital. She had never had Pho before and loved it!~~#~1
On a Sunday morning in phoenix, you are often left thinking about the fact that a good breakfast is neither close nor available.  In fact, you could sum up the valleys breakfast nooks as vacant or un found.  There is one beacon of breakfast hope that can be found in the central corridor, and Vincents be thy name.Obviously Vincents is a culinary staple in the valley that is known far and wide and adorned by all.  What is somewhat unknown to valley foodies is that right behind the main Vincents restaurant sits "Vincents Bistro."  What does that mean to the food masses? The best price point in the valley on fine dining in a great setting.  Before you engage the menu, make sure to enjoy the house made croissants and butter, this little treat will get your senses going in the right direction.  The menu at the Bistro is not complex(neither is the main dining room), but has staples such as Vincents famous smoked salmon quesedilla($10) and main lobster with handmade basil pasta($14).  The Bistro has a daily prix fixe menu that uses the following methodology. An appetizer of choice, a main entree of choice and dessert.  The price tag is never greater than $20 for the prix fixe and I challenge another restaurant in the valley to beat it.  Choices can range from prime new york steak, to lamb chops to a wonderfully cooked piece of fish.What are the cons? Good luck coordinating a take out order with the normal busyness of the operation.  Wait times for pick up can range from forty-five minutes to over an hour.  If you feel like your caught in the middle of a whirlwind circus when picking up your order, don't worry, that's just the normal pace.  In 1982 Vincent Guerithault catapulted Arizona into the beginning phases of the culinary elite the other larger metropolis cities were already enjoying.  Now, thirty years later, he has done it again with the Bistro.  I applaud Vincent and his family on their success and longevity in the valley culinary circuit.~~#~1
Awesome place! So glad they are here! If youu're a fan of obscure movies, this is the place. Love the atmosphere also.~~#~1
Definitely a must-try! The building itself isn't much to look at but the parking lot is always full and that's a great indication of yummy-ness. It caters to both meat and veggie eaters with fake chicken, duck, and beef plates. They also have mock seafood plates as well. My friend and I went to check this place out because we had heard so much about it. She ordered the lemon grass chicken and I tried the ginger duck. Both were so tasty and we were kinda freaked out because they tasted just like the real thing. The service was excellent and kudos for the waitress who kept filling up our waters...even AFTER we paid the bill. It's reasonably priced and the food portions are perfect. We even had leftovers.~~#~1
I really love this store and the computers, iPods, iPhones, as well as the accessories that I have purchased for them at this location. The staff is extremely personable and helpful when they aren't tied up with others. The only gripe that I have is that sometimes the store, especially on weekends or nights, can be a zoo and all associates are often tied up. Bonus that I only need to hand them my credit card, with no other information, and I'm out the door with my receipt emailed to me.~~#~1
This is the best Hot & Sour soup in the valley.   The Prime is my comfort meal when I have a cold as I always feel great after eating there.~~#~1
We had our anniversary dinner there, we wanted top notch sea food and boy did we get it!! Our service  was fantastic and our night was topped off with the manager delivering us our desert. She asked how our meal was as well as congratulating us on our special night. I give five stars to the food the staff especially the manager "Kari" it showed great hospitality. Good job Kings Fish House we will be back:)~~#~1
My family has dined here since the late 70's when I was a kid growing up in Phoenix. It's a point of pride for locals, serving outstanding steaks, chops, etc. it has ALWAYS looked the same and I feel right at home in the Rat Pack "themed" dining room. Enter & exit through the kitchen back door to see the busy, well-managed & friendly kitchen. This place is expensive, but the outstanding quality of food and superior service make for a fine experience. The restaurant is employee owned (at least it was... when Jack Durant died decades ago he left the restaurant to his employees along with $1 million to be divided up amongst them and rumor has it that some of the $ also went to his prized bulldogs, who are also honored by having their portraits displayed in the bar. For years & years the wait staff remained the same, and familiar to my family.)  They really put everything into their service. I sincerely hope you love it there as much as I do.~~#~1
Jojo rocks! Sunday is so good and for me it is all about the artistry of Jojo. Food good....drink prices good.....Jojo....sublime. Keep up the good work on Sundays.  Mac and cheese rocks by the way. The only thing we were wishing we had was longer live music because we were having a good time.~~#~1
Thank god for Ted's Hot Dogs!  There is nothing better in life than a charbroiled hot dog with tasty onion rings and a soda.  My cohorts at work turned me onto Ted's and I kept it secret from my wife.  Yes, I'm that cruel.  Then one Sunday morning we were watching one of those Top 10 Hot Dog shows on the Food Network or Travel Channel.  She said to me, "I wish we could have a great hot dog today."  I broke down and wept, confessing my multiple sins of all the times I tip toed to Ted's to enjoy a chili footlong dog and an all beef dog with the works. She, loving me, immediately hit me a couple of times about the head, and said "Get dressed bitch - lunch is on you."  Now, if you ever meet Marie, you'll come to know that she is sweet and understanding, but on that day, I found one of her few limits.  Needless to say, we had a great experience at Ted's that Sunday.REMEMBER:  They only take cash.  No debit cards, no credit cards, no bartering.~~#~1
I'm generally not a French food fan but this Swiss/French infusion restaurant has completely won me over.  The food is indescribably good.  Don't let the location fool you, the interior makes you forget where you are.  To top it off the chef is incredibly talented having cooked for prime ministers and heads of state.  Everyone in my party walked away feeling as though they had a dining experience, not just a meal.~~#~1
Yup, got the $10 card as usual. Found this super cute, royal blue baby doll dress. Perfect for our anniversary next weekend ;)~~#~1
It's about $30/person, and the portions are small, so you will probably feel hungry (and robbed) an hour later. Unless, of course, you are my parents and had the raw sandwich. Then you will be up all night with food poisoning.~~#~0
The majority of reviewers don't lie....it really was that bad.This event spread like wild fire, I had family members and friends talking about this event from the get-go! Me and my bf arrived around 130 to a stand still at the parking entrance, cars in front of us were u-turning their way out of there, so we did the same and parked in a nearby  field. Walking up to the event the lines looked ridiculous. Come to find out I would wait over 2.5 hours at the taco truck. Not cool. I waited by myself while family and friends waited in other lines, my sister's kids played corn hole, and some chose not to wait in line at all and grab something on the way home. The variety of games was the best part. Great FREE activities for all ages to take part in.So food wise my tacos were good. Even though I arrived on an empty stomach, the tacos weren't overly fantastic or even worth the wait. I got the veggie, chicken, and beef taco. I shared and we all agreed the chicken taco was the winner. Would I wait 2 hours for those tacos again....NOPE! My friends graciously shared their fried bread and funnel cake with the group and that was really good.Wonderful idea, poor execution. Maybe next time it will be better.~~#~0
The rice is a wonder... light, fluffy, and with a magical flavor, the beans melt in your mouth,  true happiness.I had a beef enchilada that was just bliss.    My wife had the chicken tacos that were just beyond.I wish there was a place like this nearby.~~#~1
Best toasted sammich I've ever had. I've tried a few different ones here but these days I just stick with what I know....the white widow! This place has a great vibe too!~~#~1
Military precession to detail, Quality work, Honest & Friendly. Thanks again for the quick turn around. You guys RULE!!~~#~1
I will miss you my fair, friendly, caffeinated friend...sniffle, sniffle. Good night, bad night, late night, good morning, bad morning, is it morning morning... this Dutch Bros is there for me and will be for you too. Next to "customer service" on wiki, you will find a picture of the staff. Simply amazing. Most of the time, I never had to mention my order, they had it ready when I pulled up, as well as some friendly banter. After making this my local for over a year...I felt part of the family. No burnt drip, just great americanos, excellent blended coffee drinks, and everything in between. Whether I ran, drove, walked, or crawled, this Dutch Bros was there to pick me up. As I head north to a new home...I will miss you my friend...but don't forget me, I promise to stop by.~~#~1
Having had the WORST December in my entire LIFE (cancer scare, cat put to sleep, staph infection.  Ugh!) I really needed a good way to get rid of 2007.  Yoga Pura provided the perfect opportunity to do so:  a New Year's Eve meditation.  It started at 9pm and went till the clock struck 12 and 2007 was finally OVER!  Took my intern, Tondra, and had the best New Year's Eve ever!Yoga Pura has a few different rooms for yoga, workshops and classes.  I've done the Power Yoga several times along with workshops.  Everyone is very welcoming there as soon as you walk in the door.Upon entering, there's the obligartory scent of Nag Champa, and their retail store.  They have the cutest yoga mat bags!  There are also racks of yoga clothes and different objects to decorate your house with.  A few years ago, I bought some really cool wall hangings from India.  Prices are reasonable for a private boutique.If you are going to take a class, they have a little cubby for your shoes before entering each studio.  SO much better than most yoga studios that just have a doormat with a pile of everyone's shoes.The New Year's meditation workshop was run by Jesus - I mean Yogi E.  Tondra and I couldn't help but giggle a few times during class, even though we weren't supposed to utter a sound or ever open our eyes.  OH!  During one of the several different meditations that evening, some lady started rubbing some sort of lotion on my feet.  Not sure what that was all about.  Yoga Pura also offers classes for getting certified as a yoga instructor.  If you ever need to relax, try a GREAT way to stay fit or just burn off some steam, go to Yoga Pura!  They rock!  (without making too much noise!)~~#~1
I too am also a fan of other FOX concept resturaunts but Sauce was extremely disappointing. Had seen the location at the Scottsdale Water Front but never seemed enticed enough to enter until the other night. My cousin and I met up at a central location and unfortunately this seemed like the best option in the Norterra lot.He had a pizza, which for my opinion are over-priced for their quality and size. Their menu doesn't span much taste-buds but can get any general idea of a "classy" pizza across. It was burnt and too crispy, even for just a plan pepperoni and cheese, it was boring.Torn between wanting some pizza and a salad, I ordered their "greek"ish salad which was pretty good. Although it was delicious, the salad was way to rich to eat entirely by one's self.  I was mostly turned off by their service of wine in what appeared to be a juice cup. Maybe thats fine for my kitchen but thats at home where it doesn't cost per glass. My Mom informed me later that in a juice cup is actually how they drink it ususally across the Atlantic. hmp, didn't know that. All in all, don't think I'll be getting sauced with Sauce again.~~#~0
I recently moved here from Maui, HI back to Scottsdale and thought I was SOL when it came to workouts.  Giving up my daily surf and paddle surf and moving to the desert was a worry to me.  I did not know what to do to stay in shape and continue my healthy living routine.  After hearing many people rave about this trendy whole body transformation workout I just had to see for myself.  My good friend, longtime student there took me to my first class and I was instantaneously hooked!  It totally filled my void of my ocean workouts.  The instructors are personal and genuinely good people.  I am still hooked and living a healthy lifestyle thanks this fantastic business and its employees.-Melissa~~#~1
Delicious cakes and wonderful icings and fillings. We tasted here for our wedding and we're going to choose this place!  Unlike another reviewer, we didn't have any problems scheduling our tasting. They had photo books of many cakes they've designed in the past so you can pick and choose what you want from there, sort of a mix-and-match design, or you can bring in a picture of what you want and they will create it. They have some really gorgeous cakes on display too. We took home a couple of mini pastries after our tasting and those were also wonderful. Will be back for more!~~#~1
Since we had such a great experience with the Kitchen, we signed up with them for a few glass work (shower, windows, bla...) Trouble started when they were pushing us towards a design that they wanted to sell rather than what we wanted.. they were slowly nudging us towards that goal... I did price it from several other vendors and the estimate was close, so we decided to go with Da Vinci; however several restimations and remeasurements later, they called us and told us that the original quote cannot be honored anymore as they did not consider the materials we specifically asked for + they think they will have to demolish a portion of the stucco and rebuiild it in order for the window to fit. The new quote came about 7.5% more than the original. But the whole experience left us with a bad feeling and we cancelled the remodel work.~~#~0
The BEST fritters anywhere. Seriously! Apple is my favorite. I used to live in the neighborhood, then a crack-head jumped my wall and tried to steal my bike. I was so over living cheap and we moved. But as I sit here in Surprise in suburbia safeness and chain hell, craving a donut this morning, this location of Rainbow donuts is where I wish I could be. I also miss the sandwiches/Gyros from the Shell Station at Central and Dunlap-best Gyros too. But, I digress... Tried all the various donuts and loved them,but the fritters haunt me- cheap price was a bonus. For $5 we had Saturday morning covered for breakfast. Sigh, missing the donuts...~~#~1
My dad & stepmom took me, my hubby, my sister and a family friend to Claim Jumper on Christmas Eve. The food is very expensive, yet it is sooo tasty. You get what you pay for. Keep in mind when you order the serving sizes are huge. Most of us had left overs. I ordered the Chicken Pot Pie and Potato Cheddar Soup. That was sooo delicious. We had fried zucchini and avacodo rolls. Those were so awesome. Our waitress rocked. Very friendly from the time we came in all the way til the end. None of us had to ask to refill our drinks. She was on the ball with everything. We loved this restaurant so much.~~#~1
Lisa, you were VERY confrontational on the phone and assuring us that you were not responsible for any injuries. AGAIN, he tried to tell her to stop scrubbing the side of his toe so hard and with her being hearing impaired (we were told that she was deaf, not just hearing impaired) she was unable to hear. The damage had already been done. We were running late getting my daughter to the airport that day and he didn't let me know it was so bad until we got home. I am NOT the type of person who just sues every business that I come into contact with, as a matter of fact I have never had a lawsuit against anyone in my life. We continued to watch the toe until it got so bad we had to go to the dr. I didn't rush right out and start trying to get ANYONE, you or your insurance company to pay our bill. It wasn't until talking to you on the phone that I got upset. The way that you talked to me, and I believe you were very well paid for your services that day. The way that you come across to your injured customers is inexcusible though. As for the day that this occured he did tell the woman working on my feet that it was hurting and she told him that he was just sensitive. I would warn anyone who is diabetic to go elsewhere. An injury of that magnitude could cause some serious health issues. My fiance and I are not out to make a quick buck on anyone, I can assure you of that! As for sterilizing your instruments......apparently I am not the only one that have noticed the unclean practices that your salon is guilty of.  Look at the other comments below. An understanding business owner would have been nice, you were on the verge of screaming at me on the phone. I live in Fountain Hills and can't rush right back, especially after the way that you talked to me on the phone. I can appreciate you contacting your insurance agent, but as of now, we refuse to deal with you and will only work with your agent.BEWARE OF THIS SALON!~~#~0
Some of the best burgers you can find around. Hands down.I found this place out a year ago and go back when I can. Business seems to be picking up cause I now find it pretty busy during afternoons and evenings. This establishment totally deserves it too.I recommend the Kahuna burger or Rumbi burger. Both are amazing, and come with the secret "Rumbi" sauce.~~#~1
What's going on with the food here? Is there new owners? The food seems to be getting less tasty each time I come here. The beef for the green burrito is not the same, the cheese (white) is horriible. Taste like cafeteria or hospital food. I hope the owner didn't sell and now some cheap owner are buying food now. I used to give this place a 5 star and now I would have to grade them as a 1 star until they improve the quality of there food.~~#~0
Stopped here on our way out of town after a long weekend in PHX.  We could not have been happier.  This place rocks!  Not only is the food great, but we loved their dedication to growing their own fruit, veggies & herbs and sourcing locally.We had the fabulous Insalata to start (love those crispy Chick Peas!) and the Funghi pizza (truffle oil & goat cheese!) as well a Pepperoni one.  All was fantastic. In fact, we took our leftovers home in our cooler safely tucked on ice for the 6+ hour drive home! The remaining pizza slices were devoured the next day.All I can say is that I wish we had one of these in our neighborhood.  Then again, maybe it's better that we don't!!~~#~1
Went here on a Groupon and had a terrible experience. After waiting 15 min for a table to open up, waited another 10 for menus, flagged down the waitress, asked for water, waited another 10 for water, she shoved water glasses on our table, left, waved her down, said she'd be right over, she seated, menu-ed, and watered a group of four that had just arrived. With the already horrendous service, we figured service would be faster if we ordered items we could cook on the table top. When we the food arrived, we received only two sets of dishes and silverware for 4 people.The remainder of our meal, our server never stopped by, after trying to wave her down for one thing after another, I resorted to going behind the counter myself, even taking their water pitcher to refill our waters.~~#~0
Don't waste your time at this store .~~#~0
Love Justina...!  She's got a great attitude to accommodate any type of customer.  Small joint but some of the freshest and tastiest Vietnamese around.  The lemongrass chicken, green beans, and any of the pho (Vietnamese soups) are Awesome!  Try the Vietnamese coffee for a treat.UPDATE:  Cyclo is closed on Sundays and MondaysWatch out for the busy lunch crowd... To get a seat I try to get there as close to 11am as possible.This is one of my favorite valley restaurants.~~#~1
Yes, all the Targets are the same, but this one has green lasers pointing at it and Leona Lewis or the Cranberries playing before you get inside. Oh! This Target is clean and the workers are friendly.  I think that Arizona has the best customer service.  Retail workers in the Bay Area act like they're too good to be working so they throw up an attitude and this Target totally proves that Arizona Targets are so much better.~~#~1
The best experience I've ever had at a medical office- from the front desk staff, to the hygienists, to Dr Cooper.  It doesn't get any better from a knowledge, technology, or customer service standpoint.  Outstanding!~~#~1
Good for a long flight home!  I always go through this airport early in the morning so i always get the chorizo breakfast burrito, man it's perfect!!!  Hit em up if you are passing through, the staff will take care of you!~~#~1
My favorite quaint breakfast place - love the gluten free menu especially the waffles!!~~#~1
"First we eat, then we do everything else."  M.F.K. FisherMy gods were smiling on us this evening as we had no reservation and only needed a place to gather around a pitcher of vino. My gal and I were escorted downstairs and were given one of their three finest tables, yep, hard to believe.Having frequented Richardson's, I already was a believer in the New Mexican cuisine, a style of our ancestral Mexican neighbor to the east, who made use of the local chile plant variants and the local animals. A cooking style notably divergent from that of central Mexico, and nearby Native Americans such as the Navajo, Zuñi and Ute. At Rokerij it's all about food heritage.On the menu we ordered skewers 16. Pecan wood grilled chicken, beef tenderloin, shrimp and sausage, with sauces, rice and pinto beans on a tortilla. Plus, New Mexico sausages 12. Four grilled Schreiner jalapeño cilantro pork sausages served over wood oven roasted sweet onions with pinto beans also on a tortilla.Yes Sir, 12,000 years of hunting, gathering, raising, growing, cooking right here.~~#~1
Ordered the pasta bread bowls. Got one with chicken the other mac and cheese. Chicken was raw and mushy on one and the other had no sauce and the pasta was hard. like a rock~~#~0
5 Stars for the $20 bottle and bruschetta deal. It really doesn't get any better than that. However, my favorite meals here are lunch and the weekend brunch. The soups and sandwiches are delicious and the farm scramble is tasty. Great alternative for the two restaurants across the streets. Oh, and the mimosas aren't bad either.~~#~1
I've been coming here for YEARS and just thought to review it?  WTF is wrong with me???????????????????????THIS is Mexican seafood.  I've been to other places and nothing compares!  I take a book, sit in back and people watch while creaming my "Make Me Yelp" panties as I eat my culichi.  It's D I V I N E!  Eat the shrimp with a fork but you sure as Hell better use a spoon to destroy the rest of the bowl and leave it clean!Everything is fresh and the wait staff is loaded with recommendations.  Ask, and ye shall find. The snapper Veracruz is so good I often order 2 and take one home.  The decor is fun - aquatic scenes that won't make you feel guilty for eating the seafood in front of you.  At Xmas they had a Santa at the door!  The people here a super-friendly!  They have their own parking lot.  You know it's a good place when yours isn't the fanciest car in the parking lot.  All kinds come here, despite the neighborhood not being the nicest in DoPho.  You can't miss it - even though I do pass it every time!  I think I'm too excited thinking of the shrimp culichi and my mouth is watering so much that I always manage to say "Crap, passed it again!"Go.  Just go to this place.  You won't be disappointed.  I swear.  And, you won't break the bank.~~#~1
The service was horrible! Our food was wrong when it came out and they acted as if we did wrong for calling them out on it. The music was too loud. I definitely will not be going back~~#~0
I came to test-drive a car and all of the questions I asked the salesman read the answers directly off the sticker. Since I am a literate person, that wasn't necessary nor was it relevant as the questions I had about the vehicle didn't have answers that could have been found on the sticker. Yeah, I do my own research before I waltz into these places and when I ask questions I expect my "expert" sales guy to answer them as he is supposed to know what he's selling, right?I had to leave. The next day, Salesguy Einstein called me. And then a few days later. And again, a few days after that. I'll give him that for at least being persistent. But he thought the price was the problem - not the car itself, which I decided I didn't like anymore after I drove it, and he was leaving me these ridiculous messages about selling me a "used Mercedes." It was all really annoying and embarrassing to listen to.~~#~0
Given the ancient Mexico/modern Scottsdale mashup on Barrio Queen's website, I figured it would be too trendy for me, but I ventured in around noon on two occasions and found it perfectly down-to-earth. Maybe that early hour helps avoid the service woes that are noted in some reviews.I stuck with tacos on both occasions to sample more things. The ingredients excelled on their own (as in the cochinita pobil) but were even more memorable in unexpected combinations. The best item was the taco with smoked salmon, egg and cactus - while I'm not the most fusion-friendly customer in the word this was a fascinating merger of things not usually found together.~~#~1
Wow! Great food and atmosphere! Had the spinach enchiladas with chicken! Soo good! Everything tasted very fresh and authentic. Have eaten here 2 times in 2 weeks and will defiantly return!~~#~1
I spent nearly a year in Phoenix helping my Mom through her last year of life. Essence saved my life while I was in "care taking" mode. The food matched the best I have had across the globe! My favorite? The chicken salad sandwich with basil and lemon. Also the French scrambled eggs done to PERFECTION! And, of course, that chocolate croissant! For those complaining about portion size? Check out "obesity in the USA".~~#~1
This park is beautiful.  My little boy is obsessed with train, so this is heaven for him.  We ride the train, then the carousel and after playing in the playground we visit the model train museum.  They have so many model trains in this air-conditioned area.  My kids go up and down the different aisles.  It is a great  and inexpensive way to spend a morning or afternoon with your kids.~~#~1
I cannot believe this place closed )):~~#~1
Simply put this place is outstanding.  Great food, great guys that run it, decent atmosphere if you eat in and always fast if you're getting take out.  Love it.~~#~1
If you are looking for good clean vegetarian food without all the fake meats and fake cheeses, this is a great place to go. The food is really good, a tad pricey though. But MAN they are slow slow slow. The kitchen, but the waitresses as well.  So don't go there if you are in a hurry, unless you call ahead and order~~#~1
Fantastic! The black bean fritters were as good as everyone said and I loved the Pork Paradise. My boyfriend had the ropa vieja and loved it.  He also thought the black bean rice mixture was the best he ever had!  The sangria was good, but the mojito was the best! Highly recommend!!!  If I am ever back in Scottsdale, this place will be on the list!~~#~1
What a wonderful place. They make chocolate, pastry, cookies, pies and on Sunday they make omelets for breakfast. You are handed a card with a list of ingredients, you circle what you want, and in a few minutes a yummy omelet is set before you. It was light and creamy, with all fresh ingredients. It is served with hot yeast rolls and fresh fruit. I wound up taking half of my omelet home, and finished it the next day. The coffee is really good, and the chocolates are wonderful. This is a true neighborhood gem, it reminds me of San Francisco.  It was so good, I think we are going to be regulars here.~~#~1
Shauna cut my hair beautifully and kept to my requests. My mid-length naturally coarse, wavy hair has some damaged bits from past bleaching. I'm in the process of growing my hair out, and she respected that, but was still able to weed out the crappy sections. Shauna has fabulous hair cutting skills, and is apparently a talented artist in other mediums. She is quiet and kind. I liked how she didn't need to be chatty. I also appreciate her not pushing products on me, even though I am going to pick up some pureology items from her when mine are empty. Parking can be a squeeze behind the salon. There's a back door, so it's easy in and out. Appointments are all done through the salon's site which is tremendously easy. I am newer to Phoenix and have been trying to find stylist who I consider great enough to continue visiting. I am definitely going back to Mercantile for my next hair cut, or sooner yet to shop. Be ready to peruse some great vintage clothing and jewels. I don't often write reviews, but I feel like salon reviews can be extremely helpful. I hope this one helps you decide who cuts your hair next.~~#~1
What can you say but great food at great prices. A little bit of a wait for the food. We had tacos al pastore and carene asada, and the little masa fritters. it was great. I liked the fritters a lot would order them again in a heartbeat.  the tacos were awsome as well.~~#~1
Loves it!  This restaurant is for the die-hard-pho noddle lovers!  You really  can't get anymore authentic with hoisin, sriracha and fish sauce preset on each table and poorly cleaned restrooms.  The bean sprouts are white, plump, and crisp, and the thai basil is plentiful.  The soup is hot and well flavoured.  The price point is great as 4 spring rolls and two bowl of pho were under $19.  I brought my room mate here, and he was first reluctant about beef and noddles in the soup.  Now he won't stop talking about it; infact, we may have to go back tonight.  Slurps up!~~#~1
I am not one for clubs the continual "dance dance dance," but Junkie has the best blendThe weekend extravaganza started on a Wednesday (hehe) , if it was up to me it would have ended here. Why I like this place: Get past the Scottsdale douchbag; you want to truly know what a Dbag is...go to scottsdale. Although, in a wonderful turn of events I must say I have never received so many  free shots from people I just met, and if you are like me and enjoy fun conversation, people here are picking up what your laying down. R\_NOte: I have a theory, I think people go to places lik this and clubs because of one underlying feeling....feeling on an implicit boredom. hmmm ponder.~~#~1
This is my neighborhood store and I am so glad that it is, shopping here allows me to get a quick healthy meal or snack whenever I wish. The store is always clean and the staff is friendly. About 3 months ago when their ground turkey breast was in their Fearless Flyer  Ad and they couldn't keep it in stock, after my 3rd trip there I gave up on it and purchased a higher priced item but then asked the manager when would the next shipment arrive they told me the date gave me a card to call them to have the item held and refunded my money on the higher priced item making it free. You gotta love that kind of service. Oh and bananas for .19 cents each is always a treat.~~#~1
What a fun little place to visit while I was on my spring break vacation! The building was an old house that just as fun walking through as looking through the delightful selection of vintage clothing.There was so many clothes to look through, vintage western shirts, dresses, coats and an AMAZING selection of jewelry. The owner is very friendly, nice to talk to. I am definitely coming back to Cheap a thrills on my next vacation. Oh and don't forget to look in the building next door that has furniture and a scattering of home decor and fabric.~~#~1
slow, very slow.  you would think for what they charge they would move a little faster. slow, sloowww, sllloooowwww.~~#~0
Saw this place the other day while driving home, and stopped in to pickup a quick dinner. My boyfriend & I are from Chicago where you can always get a yummy gyros, but we haven't found anything great so far in the east valley. I must say the gyros here are surprisingly delicious gyros. We also tried the kabobs which were also yummy although the rice was a bit dry. The hostess/server was very friendly. I would definitely eat here again & I can wait to try other menu items. Highly recommended.~~#~1
Excellent place to eat - we love this place.~~#~1
We took our Italian Greyhound Blu in for several lumps he developed on his belly which had swelled up and started to break the skin causing bleeding. We took him in to see Dr. Miyahira who was great, he took the time to explain all the options and let us know what made the most sense for Blu. He also educated us on how this is common in our breed of dog and how it is accelerated by Blu's love of laying out in the sun. Since Blu is 13 years old our primary concern was his age and making sure we focus on quickly fixing the issue and not get bogged down in doing test after test and additional expense. Dr. Miyahira agreed going right to surgery was the best route to improve his daily life and took special care due to his age. Surgery went well for Blu and Dr. Miyahira even took the time to remove additional lumps that he suspected might also become a problem later at no additional charge. There was also no additional charge for our follow up visit to remove stitches and see how Blu was doing. We are very thankful to Dr. Miyahira and staff, it was a very positive experience in a bad situation.~~#~1
The restaurant and downstairs bar are very cool and the food is great. To me, these aren't the types of meals you can make at home; which is a big reason I go out to eat in the first place.~~#~1
this place plainly sucks, unless you have not taste for great Mexican food than you should go here.  The food was discussing and the black beans were way undercooked, which he said that's because they were for the salad ( I want them cook even for my salad) nothing like a cold crunchy bean. The salsa was way to runny and had no flavor but the chili powder or what ever was it in. It's not worth the price they want...GROSS GROSS GROSS~~#~0
Wow - John and Rob were my saviors!  After months and months of wedding planning, flowers were the one thing that I put off.  I checked out several different places and didn't have any luck finding someone who would work with a limited budget yet still be able to create something beautiful.  I had just about given up until a friend mentioned Flora Bella.  I called and told them my dilemma - my wedding is in two weeks and I have a small budget!  No worries, they said, we'll take care of you....and that's what they did!  We worked together to create a simple and elegant centerpiece and gorgeous bouquets.  I received exactly what I wanted for a reasonable price, and couldn't have been happier!  On a side note, they aren't necessarily in the store or available by phone during their business hours but rest assured, if you leave a message they'll get right back to you!~~#~1
Chicken thigh and leg came medium rare. Entres were lukewarm. Apppetizers were incosistent. Pork shoulder was cooked at too high a temp and not long enough, stringy and dry. Beans were not cooked long enough. Fire alarm went off twice during meal and slow service with attitude. Carnitas tacos were ok. Terrible experience, pretty much ruined our dinner, look elsewhere for good mexican.~~#~0
Haven't been back in a while just because I have been too busy.  I know they have gone through some ups and downs.  I am in the industry and I know.  Staff is always friendly.  The owner Renny is the sweetest guy and Regan the manager is kind and accommodating.  Give them a try!~~#~1
Love their sandwiches! Service is great, and they are FAST.  If you ask me, sandwiches come down to the bread..and their bread is AWESOME.  We've ordered multiple times here for work as well (20+ sandwiches) and they get the order right every time.~~#~1
Great food, great service.  I'll be back soon!Nice to find a great place!~~#~1
This is the Best fast food burger anyWhere to be found, BETTER THAN FIVE GUYS and RAY'S HELL BURGER HANDS DOWN.  IT IS FLAVORFUL AND DELICIOUS, NOT GREASY AND NOT OVERPRICED!  THE BUN IS GOOD AND THE CONDIMENTS ARE GREAT TOO!  The other thing is the polite and courteous staff, the place is immaculate too!  I wish they'd coem out East!~~#~1
Great place to hang out with your pooches. The crowd is generally mellow and the dogs adorable.  MY 2 dogs love it .  Extra perks are the doggie obstacle area if you are into that . Also there is plenty of room for running which the little gal loves. Also there is a smaller enclosed area for little dogs or puppies.~~#~1
Went again for lunch! Yuuummmm yummmmm Polished off a huge bowl of Curry Eggplant! Its so fucking delicious!!! Hawaiian guy and Indian girl i went with loved it as well. It IS a bit more spicy then your run of the mill average Indian joint. So be aware of that. I am sure they will be happy to tone it down for you, but then, of course, you toning down your experience. I loved it as is. Its awesome and i am sure as hell coming back!PLEASE!!! P L E A S E do not listen to retards who bash this place for various stupid non-related shit!!! Stop by and try it. I brought half a dozen people there at various times and not one walked away disappointed - From actual Indian people to Alabama hick, to Scottsdale snob to average Joe.~~#~1
Too,.....Tooo Much!  Incredible service, atmosphere, skillcraft in art (LIVE), and what terrific Jazz and DJ galore!The drinks are generous, full bodied women, men, and dancing space!Motif is spit-spot!  How I loved  mingling with the well crafted people of all sects and genders!  I HOPE I AM THE FIRST TO YELP THIS PLACE!!!!   LOVE YA ALL!!!!!~~#~1
Due to the economy, there are some phenomenal deals out there right now for this place.We stayed in a luxurious 1000 sq ft King suite.      Granted we were there in the off season, but the pools were not crowded, and the bar service at the pools were speedy, both here and at the main resort.The property is very walkable - giving the option of two pools at the villas, or two more at the main hotel.    There are separate adult-only pools, which is awesome.   Then again, all the 'kids' on the waterslide at the main resort were 40+ :)   Either way, you'll have fun.Having a kitchen was great - my only suggestions are as follows:1.   It tis a tiny oven - and a newfangled device which I had not seen before:   a dual convection oven/microwave.    All of the heat comes from the top, which made it quite difficult to say, cook a frozen pizza.    Keep this in mind when grocery shopping.2.   You hate to buy a lot of groceries if only staying a week - consider bringing along some things, like coffee filters,plastic baggies for snacks, etc.   Yes, they will hit you up for a time-share presentation.   We declined each time it was offered and that was that.Our only disappointment was with the conceirge(s) at the Villas.   We'd ask for a recommendation on a Mexican restaurant, they'd hit print (without even speaking), go the printer, and come back with a single recommendation.   No "I like this place because" or "here are three options that popular".   Made me think all recommendations got a kick back.   Free wifi.~~#~1
This place is awesome. The trainers are skilled and very detail oriented. They will push you to the limit every time you go. This place is not for the feint of heart, so be prepared and excited to learn and work, and you will have a great time. If you want to disappear into a crowd of people learning kickboxing while punching the air and standing in place, go do Tae Bo. Their schedule is great, with classes all day everyday. I work a typical 9-5 and could make it to class every day if I wanted. They've got gear for beginners to use and will sell you your own set of gear at a reasonable price if you would like it.The trainers are great, and the general atmosphere in the gym is always positive. Other students will offer help while you are learning, so listen and learn. If you're coming in with some skill this is still a great place for you to learn and grow.I've had a great time here and would recommend this sport, and particularly this gym to anyone interested in learning.~~#~1
Let me preface my review by stating a few facts.  #1 My boyfriend and his family are Chinese, and they were dining with me.  #2 The aforementioned Chinese people in my party ordered everything for us in the spirit of authentic Chinese cuisine.  #3 I put on a happy face and ate as much rice as I could to fill up.  :)  I like to start any decent meal with a good hand-washing, especially when eating with my Chinese in-laws when they're in town from China.  I went into the bathroom at Diamond's, and I almost hurled.  I am a mortician and around putrid smells every day of my life, so for the smell of a bathroom to turn my stomach is reeeally saying something.  I felt obligated to stay and eat.  I left the bathroom and used antibacterial hand sanitizer instead.  :(  So the food began to appear.  We ordered a big pot of oolong tea to accompany our meal.  We were warned that it, along with the glasses of water on our table, was tap water.  The steamed white rice was fine and dandy, and I ate most of it.  We got dungeness crab, served chopped up but still in the shell and smothered in a brown gravy sauce that was none-too-tasty and killed the delicious crab taste.  We also had lobster that was similarly served chopped into pieced and smothered in sauce, with the meat still inside.  This method of serving made it difficult to handle the food without getting your hands dirty, including serving it to yourself from the lazy susan.  We also had cod with all the bones in it and the eyeballs still in its head, completely intact.  I did not even taste it, as I've had some bad experiences with fish bones.  The rest of the table ate the whole thing, including the fish brain and eyeballs and cheeks.  *shudder*  Just a matter of personal preference, but I can't do that.  All in all, I would never go back.  Ever.  And I'd advise anyone with a weak stomach or a strong sense of smell to avoid this place at all costs.  Again, this is simply my preference and opinion.  But I like to taste my food, not just the seasoned gravy thrown onto it.  And the smell... oh good heavens!  Check please!~~#~0
I'm not a big meat eater, but my god, if this was my last meal on earth, I'd die a happy (and uber stuffed) woman. My friend was visiting and she's from Argentina so this was kind of similar to the way the meats are prepared over there. We decided it would be wise to basically starve ourselves (with the exception of water) before our dinner at 7. We also decided to skip out on the salad bar and went straight to the meats to ensure that we could get maximal stuffage in our bellies. They also give you an unlimited ammount of yummy sides (mashed potatoes, sauteed bananas, polenta cakes and this awesome cheesy bread that was so moist and fluffy). Since there are over 15 choices of meats, I'll only name the ones I really liked and ones you might want to skip. Good meats: top sirloin, filet mignon, filet mignon wrapped in bacon, flank steak, sausage, and lamb chops (I am not a lamb fan, but boy was this good)Skips: chicken wrapped in bacon, lamb shank, and pork tenderloin (only because ours happened to be dry)The guy that seated us gave us helpful tips and pointed out this place is similar to other Brazilian buffets but with better looking servers. Agreed =)One of our servers told us the reigning champion is a 115lb woman who ate 12 lbs of meat on her birthday (with 2 plates of salad, and a plate of desserts). Gross. Steve Nash apparently can only eat 5-6lbs.~~#~1
I had a stand by appointment for a certain day which gets you a cheaper trip charge.  They did not show up that day and asked me to reschedule so I did.  Now I understand why they charge a trip charge, it's because they are so overpriced that i'm sure that a lot of people send them away once they hear what they want to charge.  It was about double what another company quoted me without charging me a trip charge.  I had to pay $49 for the service guy to come to my house and show me their outrageous prices because they wouldnt give me a quote over the phone.  Their price list is a no fuss one price only so I really don't understand why they couldn't give me a quote over the phone.The trucks are really nice looking though!  The service guy that came to my house was nice and knowledgeable.~~#~0
Food is unique and tasty. I got the grilled burrito with pork and let me tell you, I was extremely impressed by the succulence of the pork and the big array of flavour in my food. It's definitely not Mexican but a melting pot of all the different Latin countries. I was not much of a pork fan until I ate here with my wife. She got the chili verde enchiladas, those were spectacular!Will definitely be going back!~~#~1
Three different occassions I have gone to purchase items at this location and all three times they were out of stock. The third time I even called in advance and was told the merchandise I was looking for was in stock. The clerk, when I asked, wouldn't even go in the back to see if there was additional supply that hadn't been put on the shelves. These were not "on sale" items - I was looking for every day computer and/or video cables and components. Save yourself a trip: Make the trip to the Best Buy in Surprise or to the one on I-17 & Thunderbird.~~#~0
I've been using this "service" for two years and I kept expecting it to get better but it never has. For some reason that's beyond my understanding they can't seem keep their website up to date based on their current stock.  It seems to me that since the whole premise of this service is that you can order groceries ONLINE that they should at least have the site current.  That's a minor inconvenience unless you're missing the ingredient you need to make your planned meal or you don't have body wash etc.  If you're the type of person who likes to live on edge never knowing if the items you ordered are going to arrive this might be the perfect service for you.  You might even find it exciting!  If so then there you go you can thank me later for the tip.  This is all sort of annoying but wasn't a deal breaker for me, what is a deal breaker is that recently we've occasionally not received our orders at all.  There have been several occasions where they over book their drivers and we don't find out until 10pm that our order won't be arriving or even once their system accidentally deleted my entire order.  Keep in mind that if you want to schedule a redelivery the next day (and you have a job so you need an evening appt) you'll need to allow them a 4 hour window to fit you in which means if you had plans that evening their shot. All of sudden this service that is supposed make my life so much easier is more of a hassle then driving to the store. I would avoid it.  Maybe one day they'll figure it out or better yet maybe Fry's will get on board and do it right. That'd be nice.Oh PS their customer service call center sucks~~#~0
Went for coffee at this McDonalds today.  Three of their rising stars were in the drive through line, eividently the microphone at the menu had the day off.  With three of their brightest doing the work of a sign and a microphone, the line was backed up and getting worse by minute.  The courtesy of the staff was beyond lacking and the dolts who lined up for McDONALDS was scary.  I went inside to get my coffee having given up on the "helpful trio in the drive through" only to be met by the team who weren't good enough to qualify for the parking lot gig.  I would recommend dumpster diving over going to this restaurant.  Unless you are in a coma or have nothing else better to do, I would avoid this place.  WOW.~~#~0
Took my girlfriend here for Valentines day and was very glad I made the choice.  Loved the modern decor and the friendly wait staff.  We sat at the bar area and was able to watch Chef Josh and his crew deliver an unforgetable dinner for my girlfriend and myself.  Favorites included the Fanny Bay Oysters, Foie gras & the duck confit wrapped in a crepe.  Dont be fooled by the negative reviews written by amateur diners this restaurant is top notch.~~#~1
This place kept impressing me throughout our meal! From the quick seating time despite arriving at prime time hours on a weekend, to the gracious service even though we were only ordering apps, to the AMAZING food, I'm so glad we stopped by.I loved this place when it was Fine's Cellar, and I'm glad to see that 5th and Wine stole their menu and concept, because it's just as awesome. Unfortunately, none of us ended up having any wine even though the selection looked amazing, but the food more than made up for that.I ordered the butternut squash soup to start...and I mean business when I say this is the BEST SOUP I'VE EVER TASTED! (Sorry, Grandma...you know I always loved your matzoh balls, but this is in another league!) The soup was velvety, smooth, rich, and sweet, and even though I burned my tongue after one bite, I could instantly taste how wonderful it was. I have no idea what compelled me to order soup in the first place because it was at least 110 degrees outside, but I am soooo glad I did! I will definitely order this on my next visit!I also ordered the bruschetta, which comes in two, four, or six increments. I chose four (and kindly shared one with the bf): two "Apples, Brie, Fig Jam, Honey and Agave Drizzle", o ne "Tomato, Mozzarella, Basil, Balsamic Reduction", and one "Smoked Sockeye Salmon, Brie , Eggs, Onion Capers". The smoked salmon was the weakest, and the sauce that came on it wasn't very tasty, but the deliciousness of the other two bruschetta flavors definitely made up for that! The flavors on the  apple one just melded well together, and there was both red and green apples on it. The balsamic on the other bruschetta was very sweet and yummy, and the tomatoes were clearly very fresh. Would definitely order these two again!   A really nice touch was that each piece of bruschetta (which were very sizeable) was cut into thirds, making eating and sharing very easy. Bf ordered a strawberry salad that he liked, and our other dining partners loved their bruschetta as well. They  ordered a few different ones than I did, though I can't remember which ones. The service was impeccable, and the ambiance was very chic and fun, with a live band playing while we ate. It was difficult to hear each other  at times, but it was a lively setting. When our server asked if we were ready for the check, he even offered to split it up  between the two couples. That rarely happens to me-usually we have to request it, and the server will hem and haw and then agree (I've been a server and I would hate it too, so I understand), but I liked that this server took initiative. He even pointed out that if we bring our receipt back in the next two weeks, we get a discount on our meal. That's pretty awesome.Overall, awesome place, affordable too. I wish they were closer to Scottsdale Road so they would get more foot traffic! But then that would mean I'd have to wait longer when I want to eat there :)~~#~1
I first went here yesterday for lunch to help support Dining Out for Life.  My two coworkers and I were all new to the lunch spot and we were all impressed when we left.I had the chicken salad sandwich with some jalapeno chips, one friend had the southwest salad and the other had a bagel and lox.  Yes, the service was a little slow.  We weren't on a time crunch so we were okay with it, although really hungry!  All of the food seemed very fresh and I think the delicious wheat bread for my sandwich might have been made that day.  It even came with a pickle - an added touch I like with my sandwiches and burgers.The menu had a lot of options and the portions were good, but not overly huge.  Another plus - the price is right.  They also serve b-fast all day long - one of my favorites!  I will definitely be back here and now I have another work-lunch option in the area.  Woohoo!One weird side note - I think we were the only people under 65 in the joint save one family with small children sitting outside...~~#~1
This was a great end to a dreary rainy gloomy draining no good very bad day! A bottle (or two or five) of wine shared among friends, great food for us to nosh, and Thomas the quintessential host to keep the good times rolling.And chilled Patron with fresh fruit? Why we must have left too early!~~#~1
We used Chocofin chocolates for our wedding favors, and the owners were very friendly and accommodating.  They're extremely knowledgeable about the fine art of making chocolates, and it shows in every carefully crafted truffle or chocolate they make.  They even have sugar free chocolates, which was an important factor for us since we had a few diabetic people at our reception.  The chocolate raspberry and the banana macadamia nut are absolutely amazing!  I highly recommend them.~~#~1
We have been in to this Brake Masters location several times over the past 5 years with several different cars.  With each experience we are more convinced that Travis and his staff are truly concerned with the customers situation.  They have always relayed the alternative repair (when there is one) and given us the decision of how to proceed.  We never feel pressured to "trade up" to a larger repair than is required as we have felt with other Airpark garages.  We rate this shop as professional, helpful (occasionally we have needed to be driven back to work) and honest.  While car repairs are never a "fun" expense, we always leave Brake Masters feeling good about the work they have done.~~#~1
HOLY SMEEKS!Smeeks is the greatest news for Phoenix; especially with businesses closing right and left.  I'm so happy to see another great addition to my favorite complex.  Stinkweeds, RHR, Frances, Halo, AND NOW SMEEKS. Too much greatness for my little heart.Let's be real, where else in Phoenix can you find a 5 cent treat? Also an awesome photobooth, plus I love that I got to add my photo to the wall.  If you're disapointed by Smeeks then you must also be disappointed by Christmas morning, all birthdays, and dolphins kissing. Let me recommend the fat pig chocolate. SO GOOD. LIKE BEST CHOCOLATE I HAVE EVER TASTED GOOD. (are these capitals getting through to you?)If you're going by call me, I'll meet you there.  if you're looking for m&m's head over to circle k...and enjoy your beef jerky.~~#~1
One of these just opened by my house, and my husband and I were really excited to try it because everyone says such great things. I was so disappointed! I agree that the fries were limp, and I'm a crispy fry lover. The burger tasted good, but I felt pretty ill shortly after eating it. Not food poisoning ill - more like over-greased ill. I don't really eat fast food so maybe that's it, but I will not be returning.~~#~0
love this place. they have gluten free food! and they save your take out order in the computer so double bonus for me. we eat here all the time everyone in the family loves this place. they do not have gluten free soy sauce anymore.~~#~1
So, my car had been vibrating for about a week and I thought I needed an alignment so I took it to the nearest place I could find that did alignments, after price checking around.  Turns out their prices are about average for that kind of thing so I went to them.  After they looked it over they said my steering gear assembly was bad and that my tires were moving almost 4 inches independently of one another!  Because of this the alignment wouldn't be any good until I got it fixed.  They also said my front 2 tires were bad and needed to be replaced (which was true, I knew that for a while).  Safe to say, I was scared for my car!  They quoted me $921.60 for everything.Luckily I never do anything without a second opinion so I dropped in on my family mechanic, Bill at Black Canyon Automotive, in North Phoenix while I was in the neighborhood the next day.  He put it on the lift, he brought me under the car with him and he pointed out that there was nothing wrong with the steering gear, the tires were moving perfectly with one another, and an alignment wasn't the issue.  The vibration was from a bubble in my front driver side tire because one of the tires belts was broken.  I went to Discount Tire, got 2 new tires, and all was well for only $200!Thinking back I realize how bold faced the lie Purcell's fed me was.  I mean, if my tires were moving 4 inches independently of one another the car couldn't make it out of the parking lot, forget about slight vibrations over 65MPH!These guys are liars and crack pots!  Avoid them!~~#~0
I bought a Groupon for Blue Fin a couple of years ago and never used it. However on my last trip into the city I decided that I would go and redeem it for the purchased value while I was out that way. Boy am I happy that I did!!Quite frankly, this place impressed my socks right off. I had heard that it had some good items however I must say that is quite an understatement. Best Teriyaki in the city by far; their panko chicken is also to die for!Bottom line: I live in south east Gilbert and have driven to eat here 3 times in the last month. Enough said.~~#~1
Had to wait in line over an hour.  Meanwhile, other car rental counters were open and available.  When I finally got to talk to a clerk that spent 15 minutes trying to upsell me after I had prepaid for everything online.~~#~0
"OMG" Le Chalet was fabioso... Entertainment, Great clean comedy for a Sunday evening. Food, sooooo delicious. Service was great!  Price, we split between a party of 6. Bottle of wine , 3 desserts, 6 meals and our ice teas. 27.50 a piece. Not bad definitely awarded Analynn's :) Great girls night out! Thanks ladies and to Le Chalet!. If you decide to give it a try you have to try a Crepe. One more thing; you get to watch the chef on a big screen TV prepare your meal. I have down loaded a few pictures hopefully they go through.~~#~1
nasty!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!~~#~0
I have zero complaints about Lowe's! Since moving to the Chandler area, my fiance and I have made countless trips to Lowe's to buy flowers, sprinkler heads, shovels and even solar-powered outdoor lights. Customer service is helpful, there's never any lines and my favorite part about the garden center is if you are not 100% satisfied with flowers you can return them with a receipt! We had some Ice plants that were starting to look a little sad so we returned them (brown and all) and got our money back, no questions asked!~~#~1
I love this location, it always has the best movies playing in the biggest theaters. but the thing draws the 5 stars at this location is the child's play center there. Its the same price as a movie and you can let your child play there while you are in a movie they can't or don't want to watch. My daughter has been there more than 10 times and sometimes she wants to go to the movies just to go in there. They have games, movies, toys, arts and crafts. My daughter has never had a bad experience there and always comes out happy. As for the movies it is a very clean location and always enjoyed every movie experience that I have had there. Go here with confidence.~~#~1
This is one of last "true family integrated" businesses! You need to find a way to get here. The multiple varieties of "dogs" and sausages are wonderful. My kids love the attention they get from the staff, makes them feel great! Try and go next Friday or Saturday to try their authentic South Carolina Barbeque! Fantastic food, fantastic fun, fantastic family business.....~~#~1
This is the best pizza I've had since Bianco. Why would I wait 3-5 hours downtown when I can slide down Glentucky to grab a hand tossed pie and homemade tiramisu? Not to mention, my parents said the pizza was on par with or better than what they've had in Italy.~~#~1
"The Bite Means its Okay to Eat" is the motto at this paleteria.  Consequently, the mold used for making these delectable popsicles has what appears to be a bite mark.  Going in I did not know this, and was aghast when I noticed that someone had taken a bite out of not one but all of my paletas!What sets this wonderful spot apart from ice cream parlors - is not just  ice cream on a stick.  The ice cream is handmade, and only local and seasonal ingredients are used to guarantee the utmost in freshness.  Spices are ground, no preservatives are used, and it's virtually like enjoying a homemade treat.Favorites:Chocolate: blend of chocolate with spices.  Ever had Mexican chocolate?  Decadent, creamy gourmet chocolate with vanilla, cinnamon, and a dash of chile?  This is the ice cream version, and so gorgeous I could not devour it fast enough.Platano: Bananas foster, complete with homemade caramel and Anejo Rum.  Chunky bananas, blended with the sweet and spicy flavors of the rum and caramel - absolutely phenomenal!Zarzamora: Blackberry and Lavender.  Aromatic, tangy and sweet, calming, and just beautiful.Fresa Con Crema: Strawberries and Cream.  Tasted like I had whipped up a batch of strawberries with fresh whipped cream and sugar.  Superb!I recommend this as a wonderful stop after dinner for dessert.  There is plenty of seating inside and out, to sit back and relax and enjoy the flavor explosion.~~#~1
A good reason to drive to Coolidge Arizona. Wonderful local family owned restaurant. These folks know how to cook.  Highly recommended. Thanks Ted~~#~1
This is one of my favorite "restaurants" in Phoenix.Their food is yummy. If you haven't been adventurous and tried the 7th Inning Stretch Dog- do it. Sounds weird, but it is so good.  I have loved every dog that I have tried.~~#~1
I have a very personal relationship with breakfast burritos and carne asada fries.  This place really brings a smile to my face.  I also just discovered a burrito called the Patron Burrito which is awesome!!  Another new favorite!~~#~1
I mean, they just do it right.  Everything from their service, to the quality of the food, to the bathrooms, to the piano music, to their professionalism, it's just spot on.  I have been frequenting My Florist for several years.  They were one of the first places that started to change the way I felt about Phoenix....  They sort of teetered the totter that was heavily leaning in the direction of "the people are losing the fight in Phoenix.  Corporate takeover is assured."  Breath of fresh air to walk in and see a lot of the same wait staff that has been there for several years.  That says a lot.  The food is delicious.  Very fresh.  Very artisan, far from run of the mill, but still simple and not overly ridiculous.  The portions are large.  Large sandwiches, enormous delicious salads.  The servers are full of fabulous suggestions, and their daily specials are amazing.  I've been there many times, and I don't think my beverage has ever gotten empty without being offered a refill, and they have never failed to check back with me to see how everything tastes.I always tip extremely well here, because it is deserved.  In fact, I randomly ran into one of the servers at another establishment, and he just couldn't think of where he knew me from (me either) and then his eyes got bright and he said, "Oh wait!  you come into My Florist!  You're a great tipper!".  So next time you are pondering whether or not to leave the extra coupla dollars (c'mon, you know you'll just blow it on something stupid), leave it for your server when provided with great service.  My Florist is a place that recognizes their fan-base, and consistenly comes through.  I recommend the brie salad, the turkey and brie sandwich, and any of their soups.  Yes, I like brie.  It's freakin delicious, okay.~~#~1
One of the reason we fell in love with CAve Creek, was C4.  Great atmosphere, good place to sit on the porch and watch the world go by.  Live music most nights of the week, bigger concerts in the back in the Spring and fall.  Coffee, wine, beer, come in the morning and leave after dinner.~~#~1
I've only tried their chicago style pizza.  IT IS GOOD!  I am not FROM Chicago but I have been there and had chicago style pizza from several popular restaurants there.  Nothing is ever exactly the same as the city it originated from, but this is dang good pizza!  I recommend the meat lovers toppings. The cheese they use is top quality and the sauce tastes homemade.  I am trying to get a pic of the pizza to put on but we always forget and start eating before taking it!~~#~1
This place is a ton of fun, seriously. And it's a place where gays, straights, and lesbians exist harmoniously. Which is rare. There's a patio, a lounge upstairs and at least a few good looking folks. It warms up after 10, so if you go earlier, it'll be pretty empty, so wait it out. The drinks are pricey but not insane ($9 for a decent pour Absolut Vodka). I've been here twice (one Wednesday and one Thursday) and had a great time both times.~~#~1
YUMMY! OK so I live 2 blocks away from this place and I pass by it all the time and I've always wondered whats going on in that place and why is it always so packed? I'd never cared to try it because I believed it to be all patio but little did I know of the awesome inside dining area. my favorite neighborhood breakfast spot was Matt's Big Breakfast but sorry Matt the line @ your place today blew me right into Local Breeze, and in my opinion is the real "BIG BREAKFAST" and is now my new neighborhood place for breakfast. I had "The Plate" 2 eggs cooked to order atop a hearty pile of freshly made potatoes O'Brien and 4 big pieces bacon with freshly baked buttermilk biscuit served with what looked like homemade preserves. I had the nerve to also order a half order of apple brandy french toast... omg if that was a half order lord help me! The total experience @ Local Breeze was absolutely delicious and right in my backyard... I can't wait to go back and yes it was about $20 for myself alone but with those portions and flavor it's well worth it!~~#~1
I used to come here on occasion and always had a blast; HOWEVER, this time around has put me off forever.  Went to eat with friends; waitress I found to be rude as she acknowledge my guy friends and barely made contact with me throughout the night.  Sat in my chair, did not look at me nor apologize when I came back, to find her sitting there beside my significant other.  Odd...Since I found her demeanor to be lacking and found her to be rude, and short, I tipped her 10%; which she in turn told me that was "shitty" and proceeded then to call me a "bitch" several times.I kept my composure while she continued to have issues with her anger and I asked to speak to the manager.  I knew from her tone that the manager would not be helpful at all, and I was correct.  He was insincere and unhelpful.  The waitress should be reprimanded or sent to anger management as this is the first time I ever had such an experience, especially being called names.  Talk about immature.~~#~0
Still love it! Finally decided to try something new, and just had to chime in about it...it was the pork burrito on the specials board. Pork was a little bit sweet, lots of flavor, and just plain delicious...And still fast service...love it!~~#~1
First let me say the portions this place serves are HUGE. My first visit here was with my boss for a lunch meeting. I ordered the pesto pasta bowl. YUMMY. I ate as much as I could and still had enough for lunch again the next day. My kids loved the bread bowl. I had the happy ending infamous cookie dough ice cream. Loved it all. I will have to bring my kids with me next time I visit because I see that they give the kids pizza dough to play with while they wait for their food.~~#~1
Completely worth the wait! If you can plan ahead they do take reservations for parties of six or more. I recommend planning ahead for this one. Mr. Bianco is one of kind. He is the only one to touch your pizza, and he makes sure that only the best goes on it!~~#~1
Beautiful decor ... poor service. We made a reservation for which we were only 10 minutes late for due to traffic. We were told that it would be a 15-20 minute wait for a table. After waiting for 40 minutes (it is 730 pm now), a hostess told us it would be another 15-20 minute wait.  They did offer a sit at the bar if we wanted to eat there, and that they were 'very sorry'. Did I mention that it was a Tuesday night? We drove all the way from Mesa, and it was my birthday! We got a babysitter for the night and they couldn't give us a table!!I'm pregnant! No, I don't want to sit at the bar in a stool after watiing for 40 minutes!!!! So we left. After waiting all that time. And we still have to pay valet. Save your money. There are other fine steakhouses in Scottsdale.~~#~0
This is my all-time favorite bar/restaurant in Scottsdale.  The drinks are expensive but they pour the best martinis in town.  They're huge, and one is like 2 in some other bars.  A server once recommended a blueberry lemon drop and it's been my favorite drink ever since.  The drinks may be spendy, but the food is relatively cheap.  I love the ceviche and the picnic chicken, but I've never had a bad meal here.  You can't beat the atmosphere with the cool patio overlooking the civic plaza...especially fun late in the day during the Culinary Festival with Mr. P-Body spinning records.  The bathrooms are super-cool (strange comment, but it's true)  Once you locate the appropriate one for your gender, you feel like you've been let in on a secret!  And, one of the best things about AZ88 is that every 6 months or so they completely change the decor and add funky art installations.The crowd seems a bit more sophisticated than other Scottsdale places that are filled with the typical posers.  It's very gay-friendly and on Friday nights the eye candy is delicious, even if they aren't paying attention to us straight girls!  You'll find all age groups here, which ends up as a nice mix, like an interesting dinner party.~~#~1
Lost my tire center cap, broke my radiator hose. Nice work otherwise.~~#~0
Besides the fact that this liquor store has an excellent selection of beer, wine, and booze, they also have a small walk-in humidor to buy cigars!  There is nothing I love more than being able to pick up a nice hand-made cigar while buying a bottle of good whiskey and some good beer.  This place is located near Four Peaks Brewery, so I will often stop here after I leave the brewery for my at home liquor and smoking needs.the cigar selection isn't huge, but they have basic good brands like CAO, Punch, Macanudo, Partagas, Acid, and others.  If you are a lover of fine cigars and booze like I am, this is the liquor store for you!~~#~1
They have a sort of build your own pho and it's cheap! Delicious and full of flavor, I didn't need to add anything to my tofu, egg yolk and bok choy pho. Absolutely perfection.~~#~1
What an incredible experience.  They sit you at a counter, overlooking the kitchen, watching chef Juan do his magic.  For $65  you get a great four course meal, a shot of good tequila and 3 nice wines to go with the  wonderful food.  It's called the "Wine Me Dine Me"  Not only that, I mentioned that the ceviche looked really good.  Even though it wasn't on our menu, he whipped up a small plate for me.  Terrific.  We had a running conversation with the chefs and learned all about their backgrounds.  All in all, one of our favorite dining experiences.Ron B.~~#~1
I've eaten an both this location and their Scottsdale location as well.I'm always happy with their food and drinks. Service is great.~~#~1
I decided to give province another try and I was pleasantly surprised. As usual, their wine collection was fabulous. The waiter I had was extremely courteous and helpful, making it an overall fantastic experience.Instead of starting with apps, I decided to try small portions of the Pan Seared Rare Hawaiian Tuna and the House made Papardelle Pasta (I love the fact that they have small / big portions for some of their entrées!).The tuna was delicious. It had the right amount of lemony zest and the romesco sauce was outstanding. this is def one of my favorite dishes. The pasta was fresh and tasty. I loved the mix of mushrooms and monchego.  Having been to quite  a few of the restaurants in phoenix, i will say that province is right up there with the best!~~#~1
Bertha's Cafe Just opened up at it's new location, 32nd street and Indian School Rd.!!!!!  I have been going through withdrawl!!! So happy they are open.~~#~1
This place is great for lunch!  (Only time I have ever eaten here)  Very reasonably priced lunch specials make it even better.  You can get a personal sized pizza and a small salad for around $10.  The chopped salad is delicious.~~#~1
This place has opened up exactly where Blue Nile was closed down. The menu is almost exactly the same (with some Americanized add-ons), so you could just as well say  they changed the name. Same furniture and decor even, though they are showing a lot of wear. Love the the tables with the beans and lentils inlaid. The service is always better than at Lalibela - this is almost like a hidden gem after 4 years, though the strip mall lot continues to look seedy. I always share the vegan combo with the hubby, and the Wats kick ass - they have tonnes of vegan options. The sambussas and lentil soups are good too.  Finish off with the orange flavored vegan coffee cake, ALWAYS! How do they make that vegan cream??? Never tried the east of the red sea stuff - there are plenty of places where you can eat hummus and falafal, so why have the usual here? My only gripe is that Blue Nile rarely had the goat cheese on plantain available, and now Juba says they don't make those anymore. That really was some gourmet appetizer!~~#~1
I call this place the "G" spot (and I know I'm not alone).  For good reason.  It is amazingly delicious, some of the best gelato I've ever had! Sooooo fricking YUMMY.You can try as many flavors as you want too.  So naturally I try no less than every flavor available- haha- (they are more than happy to oblige you) whenever I go.  I have gotten pints to take home, it's that good.  It's a wonder I don't weigh 500 lbs.  I try to exercise some self restraint or I probaly would be.  But hey, isn't gelato supposed to be better for you than ice cream?? Something about the density so you eat less?  ;)Try it, you won't be disappointed.  I've only been to the Camelback location, although I'm sure they're all good.~~#~1
We had a business meeting here and pretty much took over the place.  It was early in the morning and there was still room for the other customers.  We got yummy eggs and muffins, and probably the bet cup of vanilla latte that I've ever had.  If I lived in the area, this would be a regular haunt for me.~~#~1
I've been to other restaurants serving Indian cuisine (in Sacramento) and Jewel of the Crown delivers. This place impressed me with its understated, elegant ambiance, service and food quality. Not only was the mixed kabob tasty and filling, the presentation was equally impressive as well (please see the photo I took). I think the food was reasonably priced and the service size very generous. I would go back the next time I visit Scottsdale.~~#~1
Love the Modified!i have been coming here since i was a wee freshman in highschool!one of my favorite venues in phoenix, gets crowded and loud stinky and awesome in a hurry, or it can be empty pensive and introvertedly artsy! just depends i suppose. I cant wait to be back, check out their events calendar on their website for gallery shows or concerts or film viewings. love you modified see you this friday hopefully?~~#~1
Have a co-worker in from Denver-has read my blog and wanted to take another co-worker and wife to dinner.  I suggested Tommy V's.  We went last night and Chef Doug out did himself again!  Amazing.  We ordered a bottle of Nativa Carmenere Reserva, Curico Valley, Chile **Organic and Crostino Di Prosciutto Toasted bread capped with prosciutto & melted mozzarela sprinkled with fresh sage and Mozzarella Caprese Fresh Mozzarella, Vine-Ripened Tomatoes, Basil, EVOO Drizzle to start.  AMAZING!!!  SO YUMMY!!For dinner 3 of us had the Grilled Shrimp Risotto Corn, Preserved Lemon and Snipped Herbs and 1  had Tommy's Amazing Homemade Pasta Trio - Tortelli Wild Mushroom, Portobello Mascarpone, Ravioli Spinach Ricotta Truffle and Gnocchi, Brie, Asiago Cheese, Brown Butter Sage Sauce.And for dessert we had the limoncello sorbet and the chocolate tartufo.  Chef Doug - you are truly a rockstar!  Love, love, loved dinner last night!Thank you again for coming out and chatting with us.  You know I just like getting you out of the kitchen ;)Can't wait to go back with the girls and do a girls night out!~~#~1
Hooray! A new place to eat great food!  How can you not want that?  I had the god fortune to get t watch this diner built from the get go.  I have gotten to know the managers and the staff, all of which rock.  These guys are doing an amazing job.  I had never eaten at a Pei Wei prior to this one opening and have to say I'm now hooked!!  I have tried almost everything on the menu and have yet to find something that I didn[t like.  The food is always hot and fresh and ready when they tell me it will be.  Parking is a bit of a problem, but with Starbucks Coffee literally right next door, it's worth the trouble.  This place definately puts yummy in your tummy!!~~#~1
MAPS MAPS MAPS MAPS MAPS MAPS MAPS MAPS MAPS!!!!!!!!!Old maps. New maps. Big maps. Small maps. Paper maps. Laminated maps. Framed maps. Globe maps. This place has all the maps. I don't think they were too happy with me when I walked in one day looking for the cheapest world map I could find (I was only going to be tearing it up for an art project), but they totally had me hook line and sinker with the gorgeous framed maps, globes and vintage road maps they held within their walls. I will be back. Because cartography is awesome. And who doesn't want to dream about the places they can go?The staff is pretty well versed on maps. I've never seen anyone more knowledgable. It also looks like they will make you custom maps of an area you are needing (part of a city, etc...). Bonus is that they offer a AAA discount too. Because AAA doesn't have all the maps. Like world maps. You can only get those at a wide world of maps.~~#~1
My movie going experience is always good at this location.  No lines, clean theaters and clean restrooms.  I love the reward concept.  Now is the time to get your new cup for 2011. One dollar sodas for the rest of the year!  I think I may buy a t-shirt this year so I can get free popcorn too.  My daughter loves the kids box....popcorn, a drink, and fruit snacks.  When she finishes her popcorn I just poor some more from my bag into the box and she is one happy camper.  Most of the time I have attended films on the weekend. I can always find parking and I don't have to arrive an hour before the film starts to get in line.  I love Harkins theaters. My only complaint is that I wish they would show more independent films at all the theaters and not just their Camelview location.  Thanks Harkins for making movie going fun!~~#~1
The Asst Mgr, Roddy went above and beyond in helping me to resolve an issue with homedepot.com. Thanks to his exceptional customer service, and patience with this extremely upset customer, I will continue using Home Depot as my supplier. Great Job~~#~1
Great BBQ.  Definitely worth stopping by.  Better than all other bbqs in the area.  I've been to them all, trust me.~~#~1
I used to love shopping at Sunflower!!  The produce was great.. with a nice selection of organic and organic binds... the prices were good..cashiers were nice!!!  WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THIS STORE!!!  First the produce was old..lettuce was old and soggy in the container, the onion I bought yesterday sprouted!! The kale was obviously old and yellow!!  I started returning things..something is wrong at this store..Then I was in over the weekend..t only got a few things..and went to the bind with organic Apricots..the bind was half full..I took some out..AND THEN I NOTICED INSECTS, FLYING AROUND INSIDE THE BIND!!!  Thats it, I'm done..and will take my business elsewhere..~~#~0
Always like this Macy's it used to be The Broadway many years ago. It was nice back then and it is still nice now.  Lots of parking and there is even covered parking in the garage ,great in the summer months. They carry a nice selection of clothes, jewelry ,cosmetics, and household goods.  The customer service is always good. So i really like them and give them a 5 star rating!~~#~1
what is this filth that i am eating?had it delivered ... but whoops!  forgot the rice.  how do you forget the rice?anyhow, the peanut sauce was deplorable ... it was literally the consistency of water, i could pour it down the drain - and did.the panang curry was the same -- more like soup and less like sauce.  this place is easily in the bottom 3 of thai places i have ever eaten at.~~#~0
Our family has gone to Dr. Hackenyos for years. All of us think the world of his superb care. He has accurately guided us through rare conditions, he refers when he feels we need a specialist. He explains things in understandable terms. He LISTENS and asks questions to refine his care. I can say without hesitation he is absolutely the best doctor we ever have gone to! We found him in the phone book and feel we won the lottery! I am glad he doesn't give medications to those who don't consult him when they expire. To me each of us are responsible for his own care. I too, am caring for a mother 90 and I have several medical issues. He has helped us through dealing with my 93 year old father-in-law as he was in hospice. My adult son suffers from a debilitating permanent side effect because of another doctor's careless prescribing. We are glad he is diligent and careful.~~#~1
All the reviews are in and they are right. This place has the best tacos in town. The location is somewhat scary, but you'll get over it. The food is top notch, the pricing wallet-friendly, and the owners run the place. Ask for some of the hidden hot sauces if you feel like crying and running home to mamma.~~#~1
OK. We live a quarter of a mile away or so. Partially due to proximity but mostly due to their food, my boyfriend and I (sometimes separately) eat here probably once a week or at least a few times a month. This place is a fantastic mom-and-pop place owned by a great couple that care about their food and their customers. The waitstaff is attentive and friendly. If you're not familiar with Vietnamese food, this is a great introduction as there are "easy" things on the menu and they serve beer and wine. For those of you that are used to eating pho and weirder things, these guys add extra tendon for me at no extra cost, which makes me drool with happiness!! Pho is a little pricey at about $10 for the combo bowl. We're happy to pay though for the convenience and the quality. The place is clean and comfortable and the ingredients are fresh and the food tastes great!~~#~1
Friendly, reasonably priced, incredibly professional staff. Will definitely be back! Also- lots of available appointment times, easy to find, and plenty of parking.~~#~1
Mike & Lou are great !! Very friendly & honest.  Being a woman you always fear being overcharged & sold things you don't need, definitely not the case!! Use them you won't be disappointed !!!~~#~1
LOVE IT!!  Table side guac is a must have!  So yummy!~~#~1
Attentive staff, succulent offerings, incredible mixologic concoctions...Citizen continues to inspire with it's near-perfect...okay, PERFECT menu of entrees, cocktails, and starters that plow new ground of satisfaction. I went to AZ88 after this place tonight, and I'm convinced this IS the best place in Lower Scottsdale - -and perhaps the Valley entire, to enjoy...everything!~~#~1
To top it all off, instead of the nice aisle seat I originally requested on a bigger plane, I got stuck boarding a mini one with a seat in Siberia, next to the lavatory door that wouldn't close and the attendant had to use a pen to keep it shut during take-off. My seat was soiled and the window cover was cracked and you couldn't even pull it down because it was being held up by a crumpled piece of newspaper. It was so uncomfortable and dirty, I didn't even want to lean back into my seat. I almost cried. I've sat on cleaner seats in the BART. HORRIBLE!! Never again.~~#~0
I love chick-fil-a!!!Im a huge fan! I usually get a number one (original chicken sandwich combo) with a sweet tea. If Im in the mood to be somewhat healthy I get the grilled chicken sandwich. Their honey mustard is really good too...my favorite kind from any fast food. I just ate at this particular one today and had excellent service. The  lady that was helping me was really sweet. She just seemed happy to be there and in a good mood unlike other places. She even gave me a free breakfast sample (a sausage biscuit) since it was right after breakfast hours. I have never got this from any place before. It was a nice gesture. I didnt try it though, I just saved it for my boyfriend...he said it was really good though (and it was reheated)~~#~1
Since we always come here for happy hour, I thought to stop by for lunch one day for sushi.  Um, yeah, there aren't very many sushi specials for lunch.  The only thing on the menu was 4 pcs sushi with soup for $10.  The menu was puzzling - had clam chowder, burgers, and non-existent sushi options.  Very disappointing.~~#~0
There's nothing better than a tasty cold beer and some good tunes on a warm lazy afternoon, and TMI is an awesome place to kick back and enjoy just that.  The beer selection, albeit somewhat small, is handpicked and lists some of the top beers around AZ.  One of my personal faves is the Imperial Stout - not only does it taste great, but I'm pretty sure its over 8% and definitely packs a punch.  The one-page menu has a tasty selection of appetizers, salads, and sandwiches, as well as some incredible desserts!  One of the first dishes I tried was the green chile mac n cheese, and what a great first impression.  I'm kind of a mac n cheese junkie... TMI's is creamy and yummy and the green-chiles give it just a bit of kick.  I've had several of the other menu items as well.  The artichoke dip is sooooooo good.  Even my housemate, who typically turns his nose at such appetizers, loves this one!  And the chips are from La Tolteca - perfectly crunchy and a little salty.  The salsa is being made in-house now and is so much better than before - great change, guys!My absolute menu favorite is the recently added CASH MONEY sandwich, which is a house-made cashew butter, cabernet red pepper jelly, and sliced banana sandwich, toasted ever so slightly and served with chips (which are great when stacked on the sandwich, too - love that crunch!).  My second favorite entree is the Coney Dog.  Sorry to all my veggie friends, but this is so good I just can't help it!  This dog is topped with finely chopped red onions and house-made brown-ale-mustard, served on a small baguette.  I haven't had a thing at TMI that isn't delicious yet!And if you like desserts, you MUST try the chile-chocolate cheesecake.  It might sound a little weird, but believe me, its just the right amount of chile to give an incredible flavor to what is already a delicately delicious cheesecake.  I've also tried a couple of the ice cream flavors and they totally deliver.  I haven't tried the Imperial Stout float, yet, but I'm pretty positive that's going to knock my socks off when I do.I've always experienced excellent service at TMI.  Matt and Courtney always greet me with smiles, as do the rest of the staff.  One of my pet peeves is a sweaty drink dripping all over the table, so whenever I sit at the tables I ask for a coaster for my beer -- the servers (O'Leary rocks!) are always pleasantly accomodating.  I've never been ill treated or ignored, and not once has my server just disappeared when I'm ready to ask for the check.As for overall decor, TMI is in a historic house in the Coronado neighborhood and is casual enough for jeans and sneakers, but for those folks who wave the fashionista flag, not to be discouraged -- TMI is swanky enough to support your trendy ass, too!  Inside are two small rooms with what appears to be the original wood floor and a candlelit fireplace.  The furniture (a couple high tops, couple low two-tops, and a long 16-person farmhouse table) are all cozy and comfortable while still giving an upscale impression.The bar itself appears to be one big solid piece of wood, and its my understanding was custom made by the guy who owns the Royal coffee shop at the Phx Public Market.  But nothing sets a restaurant apart, in my eyes, like an awesome patio.  TMI has a huge patio that wraps around the house, and there are plenty of tables and shade to enjoy Matt's custom playlists (mostly laid-back hip hop). The music isn't so loud as to ever be overbearing, but loud enough that you'll eventually notice your head has been nodding in time to the music as you munch out.Hands down I absolutely love this place, and its pretty awesome that I can walk the three blocks over to hang out. :)---------------------------------------------I am editing this review to add the following helpful suggestions:- In summer months, a coaster would really keep my table tidy because the cold drinks sweat so much.- Printed menus on nice paper are a great touch, but they should be swapped out with fresh, clean versions when they get smudged with food.~~#~1
On Valentine's Day went to Fogo De Chao for the first time. This was also my first Brazilian steakhouse experience. I am going back next month for more! It was very busy the night we went but we had reservations which I would suggest. We had great service from the team styled staff. The salad bar was good but I filled up on all the meat! I also loved the sides of mashed potatoes, fried bananas. My favorite meats were the Lombo (pork loin encrusted in parmesan) and the filet mignon.~~#~1
I am very familiar with bike shops, and this one is by far the coolest one I have seen.  The bike shop was very organized and had a big variety of accessories and quality bikes. The coffee shop is why we went, and it was fantastic. Definitely the best coffee I have had in a while. My fiancee got the large iced caramel swirl and his only complaint was that he wished he'd ordered 2. I had the americano and was impressed. The staff, Brian, seemed to have the alter ego of a comfortable, friendly, coffee barista, as well as a knowlegable, down to earth, bike guy. When we stood at the cafe I felt like we were in a cafe. We sat on a couch and played mancala which made for a great Sunday morning. The place is not like a bike shop with a little half-legit coffee area with packaged doughnuts, it's worth visiting just for the coffee. When you're there, it's like a coffee shop with cool bikes for eye candy. But the bike store is big enough that it can handle all of your tech needs and stocked enough to give you a big selection of products. Will definitely come again, love it!~~#~1
customer service stinks- enough said.  i asked my doctor for a dermatologist referal and was given this guy.  in doing my own research i couldn't find a web page for them besides a single page with no contact information.  i called and after immediately being put on hold for 5 minutes i got hung up on.  yeah, i really want to go there now- heck, i don't even trust my primary care doctor after this~~#~0
I LOVE this place!  My sister jokes that the only reason she comes to visit me in Arizona is for Postino's!~~#~1
It's been a while since I have eaten here, but when I last went I had a horrific experience.  I got the chicken salad, which was full of dark meat, bone, gristle, skin, etc.  I had to run to the bathroom and get rid of it.  When I returned to the table, I calmly explained to the manager I was unhappy with the food (you could see that the quality of food was really low.)  The manager was rude and I had to argue with him to remove the meal and my drink from the bill.  I would think that after a customer was caused to vomit he would have already taken my meal off the bill...at the least.  I'd never go back.  I wrote a letter to the head chef of the chain and copied the manager and got absolutely no response from either.  Poor food.  Poor service.  Poor management that goes all the way up to the highest level.~~#~0
The carnitas is amazing, burritos, enchiladas, or tacos. Try a burrito enchilada style!~~#~1
This place is amazing.  The selection is excellent.  This place is second only to Hi Times Wine Cellar in Costa Mesa California.  They have a great craft beer and wine selection.  They also have free wine tasting going most of the afternoon Friday through Sunday.  When I went they had some free tasting for some flavored vodkas as well.~~#~1
Fantastic flavors, nice presentation, good portion size, novel menu, vegan and gluten-free options, appealing restaurant design, clean, friendly staff. Ordering spicy (vs mild) it was actually spicy.~~#~1
The location of the restaurant lays on the fine line between upscale Scottsdale and the old town Scottsdale. Literally, you can look across one street and see beautiful homes, turn around and look the other way and catch a glimpse of peopleofwalmart.com in person.I give this OG a 5 star rating because of our waiter, Corey. He was the best waiter. Ever. He had a sense of humor (which is almost never seen in a waiter) and attentive but not overly so. Corey, if you are reading this, you deserve a raise! The food is standard OG. Endless salad and breadsticks. But if you are lucky, Corey will be your waiter. Be prepared for an OG experience like you've never had before.~~#~1
Really like this location because it's conveniently located next to the Dollar Tree and they always have sales on their pet items! After my initial visit, I switched my cats food selection to Blue Buffalo per a cashier's recommendation.  At first I was skeptical looking at the size of the bag & its price tag but as she explained off the top of her head the ingredients and even her own cat's experience with the food, I was sold. Needless to say, I've been coming back ever since to purchase their food and once in awhile, toys. They have a great selection of feather sticks with any and every attachment you could ever think of. Another plus: they're all pretty reasonably priced!~~#~1
Fuego bistro is amazing! I love the food, I was so impressed by the flavor of the dishes. This is one of my favorite restaurants. There is a nice patio you can sit on and I love the decor! Fuego BIstro is mouth watering.~~#~1
We went in November 2010 and our stay was Completely serene.  The staff is ABSOLUTELY professional and wonderful! They saw us walking through the parking lot with luggage and they swung into action .. zoomed over took our luggage from our hands, and offered us a ride to the lobby! Wow THAT is service! The room was extremely conducive for resting and rejuvenating! We arrived at 10 pm and the room service was delicious and FAST! Very happy about the interesting LOCAL vegetables that were indigenous to the native Americans there. The bathrooms were INCREDIBLY clean and luxurious! They had thought of everything from hairdryers to light up mirrors! A sunken extra wide tub and a gorgeous glass shower that made you feel like yo were in a waterfall!  All night we heard the wonderful stream from the river and all the wildlife!  ~ this is a place for a real get away vacation with amazing trails to walk, ride horses, have spa treatments, and just sit by the pool and hear yourself think!  The little gift shops and restaurant was cozy and DELICIOUS! Everywhere you sit it appears that you are out of doors in the old west BEFORE it was settled! My guy and I were caught up in the charm and romance!~~#~1
Eat here at least two--three times a month and its always awesome. Food, Bar, Customer service are great. Its a pleasure dining here. Lots of locals from Paradise Valley. Bar is as good a place as any to sit. KISSKeep it Simple Stupid~~#~1
I am in love with Switch, AKA Switch Bakery.This newly opened joint is right on Viriginia and Central in Uptown Phoenix--squeezed between Scholtzky's and Durants. I used to loathe the fact there weren't many quality restraunts in the area where I work on Thomas and Central till I found Switch.They opened 2 months ago and feature a variety of sandwiches baked fresh everyday. You can find turkey and a variety of meat, humus, prusciutto, murano chicken etc...all outstanding, the salads are great too. There is a large communal table/ bar right in the center of the restraunt, and the room is beautifully decored in 21st century Noveu! There is also a large outside seating area between 2 walls which creates somewhat of a courtyard that opens to the back parking lot. It is absolutely delightful to dine with professionals in this al fresco setting. I love the fact you can sit anywhere without being shown to your seat, just look for the blue card that seat is open. Service is prompt too and the staff is well trained. I was surprised how busy it's been when I've gone there, apparently word has gotten round. You can check the entire menu on their website, www.switchofarizona.comA must for anyone having lunch in the uptown Phoenix district on Central Ave.They are open till 11PM too. Can't wait for happy hour.~~#~1
I dig pirates, freedom, and tech, so when I caught wind of Gangplank via Twitter, I had to check it out.  The Web site is real pretty but didn't give me a solid idea of what to expect -- I was imagining something like an ASU computer lab or some ish.  Lucky for me, mi amigo David Daniels (@launchclinic) from Pragmatic Marketing was presenting at the weekly brown-bag lunch talk, so I slipped up in there to find out what's really hood.As it turns out, the only thing that Gangplank shares with the old Computing Commons is computers (and it's BYOC at that).  Whereas a lot of shared workspaces can feel either sterile or stifling, Gangplank put its electric vibe on me as soon as I walked in.   Whiteboards and bulletin boards on the perimeter are host to flow charts and slogans ["Walk the plank"]; folks collaborate intently on cool-looking  'jects; rooms off to the side are used for recording podcasts and incubating new ideas.  The presentation (or "roundtable," as Daniels called it) was dope (and streamed live), and there was a lot of insightful discussion during the session.  After Daniels wrapped, I hung around for a few minutes to meet  a couple of the other attendees and Gangplank honchos (including SimpleSeating chief Steve Swedler), all of whom were very personable and really nice (+ scary smart) folk.Just to make sure it wasn't a fluke, I popped by for the next Wednesday talk, this time by James Archer (@jamesarcher) of Forty Agency.  Different topic, same fresh experience, same crowd of in-thar people.  That's two for two -- next week, I'm going to get some work in during their Wednesday "hacknight."This joint has the kind of exciting, inspiring atmosphere that gets Frankenstein's monster off the slab.   Vibrant, fun, rebellious, yet hella focused.  The kind of place where ideas flow and real things get done.Gangplank is the only movement I can think of that lives up to its own hype.  Highly recommended.~~#~1
If you live near fresh water (San Francisco, Seattle) don't eat fish here. Everything - EVERYTHING is frozen. Sand dab, no, - scallops - no, prawns eh, no- even frying it didn't help. just don't eat fish in AZ. Veggies are good Wait staff is goodMojito was GREAT - not a mix~~#~0
Finally an upscale Chinese buffet, where have you been all my life? Away with the mess hall atmosphere, since it is in the old Claim Jumper restaurant, the seating is nice and secluded. Sushi station has a ton of variety and the other choices are plentiful and high quality. The cream cheese wontons are the best and the fruit is cut up, ready to eat - even the oranges came out of their peel. Don't even get me started on the desert selection. Well, if you must, I tried the straw mouse and the chocolate mouse, both delish and even the mundane chocolate or tapioca pudding is served in appetizing little containers reminding me of the wicked spoon in Las Vegas. So much better than the piles you get at other locations.Absolutely my favorite Chinese buffet from now on, I shutter now thinking of my old digs.~~#~1
Why did I agree to go here? BLAAAAAAH! Even for fast casual Japanese food, it sucked. I got the low-carb (no rice) teriyaki salmon bowl. The vegetables _ a mix of cabbage, broccoli and carrots _ had no flavor whatsoever. It was like hospital cafeteria veggies. Ever hear of salt or using a flavored broth? The sauce on the salmon was OK but once you eat off the top layer, no flavor inside at all. It was not worth $6.62 or whatever the price. I rarely go so far as to say "Oh I could have cooked better at home" but in this case, it's true. One of the worse meals I can remember having. And their shiu mai dumplings obviously frozen and then cooked because a) way too labor-intensive otherwise and b) that had more flavor. How can it be next door to Cherry Blossom Noodle? I need a good meal to counteract this.~~#~0
Walking this place is like walking into Willy Wonka's fairyland.  A million beautiful flowers?  Check.  A mile of produce, much of which I've never heard of (and I watch Iron Chef)?  Check.  Amazing sushi samples?  Check.  Samples of EVERYTHING? Check.  Starbucks, amazing deli, smoothie bar, olive bar, salad bar, cheese department, bakery, fresh cinnamon sugar tortillas... Yes, yes, yes.  Covered parking?  Yes.  Valet?  Yes.  A soda machine where you can put some cherry syrup in your sprite?  YES!  AH!  TOO MUCH!!!Employees in the store always offer to help me.  Maybe they work on commission and think I'm an easy sell when I'm walking around with drool coming out of my mouth.  Who knows?!~~#~1
This place is top notch! Fun and clean as well as cheap to stay at! Since the rennovations this place seems much better than people on other website's were saying. They said watch out for scorpions and its dirty and loud.... I saw none of that. In fact all I saw was quality. Wanna get trashed and walk around to all the resort bars? go for it... Need a cheap cab to scottsdale and back? They got you covered.... wanna sit in the jacuzzi and drink margheritas? Thats very doable. Theres only a couple of complaints I had which to some might be bonuses! This place has alot of kids and family activities.... This is incohesive to my continual vacation alcholism. This place has beutiful exotic views of phoenix and the camelback as well as upscale candlelit restaurants to see these views perfect for any couple. I travel alone. This place does not have the screaming drunk girls you may find in Hoboken NJ or NY NY, dressed in less than nothing and having had too many cosmos wants to talk to every guy she see's.... agian I travel alone I had to goto scottsdale for that though theres plenty in scottsdale for everyone... Overall if your from the east i reccomend it ... compared to NY prices its DIRT cheap as is everything down in phoenix...~~#~1
Bad service. Really really bad. Food is okay~~#~0
My favorite independent bookstore in all the wide world.~~#~1
They say Phoenix's greatest restaurants are found in strip malls and this is a prime example.  A good friend took me here on a Monday night and we were greeted by the Italian husband and wife owners and shown all the fresh hand-made pasta specials of the evening.  I chose the crimini infused pasta with crimini mushrooms, truffle oil and....magic!  Caprese salad is the precursor to any italian meal and they have it perfected- adding roasted peppers.  The suggested wine was incredible and the pasta left me speechless!  It tasted just like the night in Rome when my new friend Fiorella took me on her vespa to the "restaurant where typical italians eat".  I savored each bite at Marcellino just as I did in Rome!It is a bit pricey, but worth every cent!  I can't wait to go back!P.S. I tried to incorporate the genius term "American Bastardization" into my yelp like Anne W, but couldn't get it to fit.  The analogy Marcellino:Rome as Olive Garden:American Bastardization of Rome is my best attempt.~~#~1
OMG OMG OMG, the happy hour hamburger is so delicious (I think it's the bacon that does it). I've only been here twice, and both times for happy hour. They have an excellent happy hour for the quality of food they serve. I've tried, obviously the burger and also the crab cakes, both which were yummy. The drink specials are great too, they make a great margarita and have an ample wine list. I'll be back!~~#~1
I love small museum that pack a big punch S.M.O.C.A. delivers a hard conceptual hook. Yeah, the museum closes before one can truly experience Turrell piece but that's modern art for yea ! But what this museum has going for it - is that unlike major institutions that have to caterers to their collection - S.M.O.C.A.  can host cutting edge curatorial projects.Go, if your in the area...~~#~1
So far we are at 5 stars i write drafts as i'm at the place, then finish them later, the staff has been great! Our server was the best server that I've had in awhile, she was on top of everything got our drinks for us fast and hung out when she wasn't busy, if we walked outside to the patio she found us and would check up on us! She joined the rest of the girls in the punching game in the back corner of the bar and she could throw a punch for a little girl did better then a couple guys that were there and had tried. They have cotton candy that come in a metal martini glass and they also have outside on the fire pits that have a pan above the fire and they put some stuff in it to make it smell good, not that it smelled bad out. The other thing they have there is a meachanical bull, that only women should ride because when guys ride the bull it just doesn't look right! Overall I would love to come back to this place simple based off how great of sevrvice we recieved! And it doesn't hurt to have all the other stuff they have there.~~#~1
Ok, I am a pizza perfectionado.  grew up in NYC where great pizza is one almost every street corner.  As of late I've developed a taste for the true taste of Neapolitana style (real italian pizza)...  I have become quite expert in making my own neapolitana style pizza at home too, but when I do eat pizza out Cibo's is my very favorite.  It is set in a converted bungalow for a very homey atmosphere.  The proprietors Tony and Karen Martingilio and their son Michael Krasner are the most gracious and caring hosts I've ever encountered.  Guido Saccone is the Italian born and trained pizzaiola.  He crafts fine neapolitano pies my favorites are the margherita and sausage.  They also have great salads, antipasta, and at lunch time great sandwiches on homemade bread.  If you still have room, defintely try one of the crepe and Nutella deserts.  My favorite is the one with bananas.  Cibo's also has a carriage room suitable for private parties and can hold up to 60 people.  Also on Tuesday and Wednesday they are offering pasta specials homemade and handcrafted by Chef Guido.  So for a great all around dining experience you should check it out!  Tell em Lloyd sent ya!~~#~1
There are so many things on this menu that I love - the pizza is delicious, the salads are fantastic... and now they have beer!!!   I remember when they had room for two tables when they first opened, and now - wow - after the expansion, it's just a great relaxed place to hang out.    Wall-to-wall people over the lunch hour, no surprise!   YUM.~~#~1
I've been an avid Nordstrom shopper for many years and was disappointed when we moved to a state with only two Nordstrom stores. After getting over the fact that there were no longer 4 Nordstroms within 20 miles of my house, I ventured to the Fashion Square location. Thank goodness it is one of the best Nordstroms I have ever been to!I typically shop in the women's shoes, point of view, t.b.d, active, and juniors sections. The staff at this store really take the time to explain their products and offer valuable style advice. The girls in the point of view section recognize me each time and remember the brands I like. I've used the tailoring service at this location (free if you buy a full-priced item) and was very satisfied with the results. I also have the business cards to two people from the shoe department who offered to set up appointments and pull shoes for me before I even come to the store. It's that kind of supreme customer service that makes Nordstrom unique.Sometimes I like to shop without interference. I find the associates to be less pushy than some of the other Nordys I'm used to in California (of course, it varies by department). Also, the shoe department is kept very clean even during the busy anniversary sale.Parking is pretty smooth. The lot next door connects to the store on multiple levels and it usually doesn't take longer than 5 minutes to find a spot.~~#~1
Had gone to firestone in Tucson while in college, figured I could trust the company/brand in Scottsdale. 1year old civic, 15k miles...went in for oil change and was given a $600 list of recommended services.I declined (thank g.) & and took it to Honda for my next oil change (4k miles later) everything was fine. Firestone lost my business. Sucks most bc zipps is right next door. Boo!!!!~~#~0
Mexican food is funny because it's one cuisine that we tend to have so many favorites in that we need to make sub-categories. As such Comedor Guadalajara would be filed in my database as the Mexican seafood place that I won't eat all day in anticipation of over-eating at. This is a very thin category, in fact it's the only one. The Veracruz style snapper is single-handedly responsible for keeping me from moving to another city. The shrimp tacos certainly pitch in on this retention campaign as well. Let's go back to the snapper for a moment, shall we? This dish serves an ample portion of fresh snapper  in a near stew-like combination of jalapenos, onions, bay leaves and a rich tomato sauce. If that's not enough, you have the option to add shrimp. If I'm not feeling like eating off the coast, the chicken mole is sure to get my vote. The mole here is so good that I get a little insulted when I see it on menus elsewhere. The chicken is pulled from the bone and seems stewed as it's very tender and juicy. Service is always quick and friendly here. Decor is not the most inspiring here, but in Mexican restaurants I think that is a badge of honor. Folks of my pale pigment may pass on this place because it's location is rather industrial and low rent. That's fine by me, they can go to Macayo's and I'll take my usual booth under the spray painted swordfish.~~#~1
Great food!~~#~1
Had a lovely meal here last night for my husband's bday. We enjoyed the $5 aloha happy hour at the bar. All of the drinks were fabulous. The lobster roll was good and fresh, but it was difficult to taste the lobster. The calamari was great, but the sauce was far too spicy for our tastes.They had a special birthday message in the menu as well as chocolate bday wish on a small dessert plate of cookies and a picture of the two of us to commemorate the special occasion.My Mahi was very good, although slightly dry. The husband's shellfish sampler was superb. The chocolate souffle was delicious! The restaurant made it a very special dinner.~~#~1
My friends and I had a blast at Benihana on a recent visit!  I'm sure we could have found better Asian food in Scottsdale (especially the sushi) but you really go to Benihana for the show.  The chef at our table was great and actually was able to get all of food on our plate, even the stuff he threw.  You can't go wrong with the Tepanyaki anything (and it's a great place to go if you're doing a protein diet).  As for the sushi--ehh--go somewhere else for that.  We all left laughing and happily stuffed.  They're opening a location in Chandler soon, too!~~#~1
Great place to buy appliances. Delivery was prompt and hauled old appliances away. Check for sales during holiday weekends.~~#~1
Total charge - zero for fix a flat~~#~1
I wish I had read the reviews ahead of time about being upsold insurance you didn't want, because that's exactly what happened to us.  I complained when we returned the car and of course, they refused to take it off.  In 30 years of renting cars, I have always DECLINED the insurance, and that's exactly what I thought I had done on Monday, Jan. 2, 2012, but Dollar is apparently making too much money on the insurance to hear you when you say, "Decline."  I will NEVER do business with them again.~~#~0
Amazing:-sweet & attentive service-music-atmosphere for no one there on a Sun night!- prosciutto pizza-italian meat slicer-white glass christmas tree-beet salad-overall experience~~#~1
If you enjoy kitschy, vintage toys/furniture/collectibles then you will love this store.  I have found some really awesome stuff in this store and it's by far my favorite store to hit when I'm in the downtown Glendale area.~~#~1
Changed to Native New Yorker - same owner (Rod Ticknor)~~#~1
Was in the area on business and did not expect to step into one of the best in the West.  I travel often and will drive long and far for great coffee.  I've sampled the best in the Seattle, San Fran, LA and New York and this place ranks near the top if you're looking for quality coffee experience.  I ordered a breakfast burrito and cappuccino.  The burrito was piping hot and perfectly balanced between contents and wrapping.  Unlike burritos that blend too much cheese to confuse the quality of the ingredients, this modern version of the classic is a very modern Panini wrapped interpretation of the classic that possessed just the right amount of contents.  All high quality and made with precision.The cappuccino was lovingly prepared.  The ratio of milk to coffee was perfect.  The grind was both smooth and robust.  PCR exceeded expectations on every level and I look forward to sampling their full coffee menu.~~#~1
This place is great! I had my navel pierced here about 4 years ago and the staff was very professional and friendly. They autoclave all their instruments, meaning they're 100% sanitary, and they answer any questions you have. They also offer a 24-hour pager service in case you have an emergency. I'd go back, though I don't know what else I would get pierced. :-)~~#~1
I'd have to say that I am definitely a fan of this place. Very small and kind of out of the way in the strip mall, but great nonetheless! We got takeout here all the time after work. The food was always good every time, and they were always very friendly! We would generally just split an entree because they are so big, but they would still give us at least 2 fortune cookies and enough supplies for 2 people. (Many places we've ordered takeout from only give you one fortune cookie for one entree... not really a big deal since we don't even eat them, but I thought it was a nice touch here at AJK. It's the thought that counts! They are very thoughtful! :)We recently decided to dine in for the first time, and we were just as satisfied as before. The food was the same quality as take out of course, but the service was phenomenal. It wasn't very busy at all, and everyone was extremely polite. We had Plum Wine and Oolong Tea, but quickly realized we needed some cold water with the hotness of our food! Both spicy and temperature... It was all very good though! Our favorite thing to get there is the cream cheese rangoons, and they are the best we've ever had! So delicious! I could eat tons of them for my entire meal, but I don't ;)Some of the dishes we've ordered weren't so great here, but that's just personal preference. What we do like is excellently prepared, and we've never really been disappointed. The dinner for two thing we had when we dined in was a mistake... it was more like dinner for 3 or 4!!! Or maybe we're just not American enough. One entree and 1 or 2 appetizers would be enough... the dinner for 2 came with spring rolls, cream cheese rangoons, soup, a huge plate of rice, and 2 entrees. We had tons of leftovers, which was okay with us I guess! You definitely get your money's worth here though.Oh, and the place is small, but very nice inside. Nice atmosphere... nothing spectacular, but it's comfortable and quiet. They also had 2 flat screen TVs that I saw, but I didn't really pay attention to what was on. Sports? idk.~~#~1
Victoria secret Tempe market place sucks!,,,if you hurt your self there they don't care, they care more about selling you bras rather than asking and see if you are ok, instead of are you ok? Can I order you bra online? Ah! HELLO! I can order my own bra online! I made a complaint already ! 3 times people! Nobody called me ! I guess nobody gives a SHIT!Z!~~#~0
So conveniently located right of the terminal when I got off my flight. The gal working there made sure I had the freshest, gooey cinnabon. Great service and awesome food!~~#~1
I LOVE LOVE LOVE to eat here!  I never had an InO burger til I was a student at UCI in 1991.  From that point on, I was hooked.  In 04 I moved east and every time I'm near an InO, I have to stop!  I got off the plane yesterday and asked the rental car lady how to get to the closest one.  I'd been once before but couldn't remember the directions.  My partner and I jumped in the car and zoomed over.  We were on a mission.As soon as I walked in and smelled the burger grease, I knew I was home.  I showed some restraint in only ordering the cheeseburger combo (I normally get the double double).  I inhaled my food and left.  I'm plotting as to which day I'll be returning this week--and I will get that double double.  YUM!~~#~1
It's hard to review food when the cleaning chemicals are so strong you can't eat.  The section I was seated in was being cleaned with strong disinfectant, I was asked to move my feet so they could clean the floor under my table but they swabbed my feet too!!!  I was here for food, not a shoe swabbing.Well, I got sick from the disinfectant, paid for my food and left.  Yep, they make you too sick to eat, then charge you for food that hasn't been delivered!!!So I can't comment on the food, but the cleaning products stunk and left stains on my shoes.   Not really the experience I was looking for.~~#~0
A TOTAL DIVE WITH AMAZING FOOD! Guy Fieri needs to go here, and I am emailing him to let him know about this place.  We went on Thursday, April 7th as it was my daughter's birthday and she chose this as her place to go for lunch. She had been here before but it was my (and the hubster's) first time. If you don't know where you are going you would pass right by this place, and from the outside it doesn't look like much. Once inside, you pick a table and a waiter/waitress will come to you. The decor is not fancy, but it is fun and festive. We were asked for our drink order, and then the chips and salsa arrived. They bring a pot of red salsa, and a pot of green salsa. AMAZING RED SALSA. Be warned the salsas are spicy. You can take a first taste,think nothing of it... and then like my husband say, "It's not so hot"...and then came the heat after he took a large amount of the red salsa on the next chip I ordered a milk for him because the water and beer were not putting out the fire party in his mouth! We did order 2 more pots of salsa (fyi there is a charge for extra salsa). I liked the red much more than the green. The green was good too, but the red salsa has a great flavor and heat.      My daughter ordered a bean chimichanga with red sauce, I ordered the chile relleno dinner (act surprised), and the hubster ordered a green tamale dinner. 2 of us had beer, and one had a sprite. Shocker I know that I didn't order a margarita. The food is very, very good. I love chile rellenos and my dinner at Los Dos didn't disappoint. The hubster stated his tamale dinner was very good, and my daughter's chimi plate was also very good. The flavor of the food is authentic, and so good! We ordered guacamole and it tasted like they just made it...so yummy!     Parking can get very interesting during peak times so be aware. The service was great, and we will return here again. I can't wait to take my mom here, she will love it.~~#~1
I highly recommend RR Limousines Car Service! They are extremely prompt, proactive, courteous and professional drivers.  They're excellence in what they do make all the difference in world especially when utilizing their services for airport transportation; they absolutely take care of you curb-side to curb-side, and get the job done!~~#~1
Pane Bianco is to sandwiches what Pizza Bianco is to pizzas, namely heaven on earth. Both share Chris Bianco's dedication to using only the freshest, locally-sourced ingredients.  Pane Bianco features home-made bread baked in on-site wood ovens, hand made mozzarella, basil and greens out of Chris's own garden, and high quality meats from locally owned Schneider sausage. You can't get more local, or better quality than this. Pane Bianco has the added benefit of being a sandwich counter, which means you don't have to wait hours for a taste of deliciousness.  Although as others have mentioned at the lunch peak you may have to wait a few minutes; after all quality can't be rushed.  Take the opportunity to grab a coffee next door, or better yet, get to know your fellow sandwich fanatics--this is how community is built.  If you are looking for an infinite selection of sub-par ingredients, or care more about price than quality, there are several other sandwich shops for you. so please don't bother coming here. And if the idea of ordering along side individuals who don't look like suburban clones scare you, this likely isn't your place either.  Check out one of the approximately 1,912 other sandwich shops in strip-malls throughout the Valley that cater to your tastes.  But if the freshest,and highest quality ingredients, knowledgeable service and authentic surroundings are are important to you, Pane Bianco is your type of place.And if you do value quality over quantity, and authenticity over generica, but still feel that $8 bucks is a little steep for you in the current economic climate, share with a friend. The portions are generous enough to share and still feel satisfied. (although be sure to snap the chocolate treat for yourself!)~~#~1
I will never wait in line at Biancos again unless it is just for the appetizers.    This is really good pizza and worth cramming into the little restaurant.  They make the biggest pizza I have ever seen and if you have a small car it probably won't fit for take-out so be prepared to strap it to the roof or something.~~#~1
Wow!  The guacamole...Graphic art meets Culinary art!  If you're in the mood for Mexican, this probably isn't the place because its not what we white folks think of  traditional at all.  However, if you are in the mood for an experience (both for food and ambience) this is your place!  Small and quaint with a large selection of Mexican beer and Tequila and great happy hour deals.  Don't forget to check out the bathrooms - seriously.~~#~1
Amazing instructors! Best workout I've had... The studio has every piece of Pilates equipment, so the workout is never dull. I feel wonderful and more energized after each session! Highly recommended to all!~~#~1
We tried out a nearby Pizza place tonight, Began's Classic Italian Pizza. It's tucked away in a dying strip mall on Baseline, west of McClintock. You really would need to know it's there to find it. I was expecting a strip mall kind of joint but was quite pleasantly surprised by the place. It's very nice, well decorated and perfect for a romantic dinner. They have an outside patio and seats at the bar in addition to ten or so tables inside. We split the Mediterranean Mix appetizer which was Feta Cheese, a selection of olives and a basket of warm, soft and tasty bread. It was a nice starter that we followed with the Diavola Pizza. That was topped by homemade Italian sausage, pepperoni, crushed red peppers, jalapenos, fresh mozzarella and tomato sauce. Really good!The pizzas are 12 inches so plenty for two. We actually only ate half of it and are saving the rest for breakfast. My friend enjoyed a nice glass of Chianti with her meal and they have a pretty good wine selection.The service was friendly and efficient. Our server told us they've been open for seven years. I can see why they've managed to do so despite the location.Total cost of our meal (I had water) was $31 which is a great value for the food quality, quantity and service.~~#~1
Read the reviews and went to the hidden gem for dinner tonight (Saturday night) and it was dark.  Either temporarily or permanently closed.  Call before you spend the effort...~~#~0
Probably the best sushi in town. Fresh fish - always ! (not easy in AZ)We always enjoy the strong drinks . Not much changes in the menu and the specials repeat, so I would like to see more creativity but overall I love this place! The bar upstairs should be open for people who eat at the restaurant. You should not sand in line or pay the bouncer to get in after you spent $200 at the restaurant... I would definitely recommend trying this place! I think they have great happy hours and summer specials right now. Worth a try !~~#~1
I ordered some cupcakes from Urban Cookies. They were wonderful! Everyone loved them, and I really liked the variety of flavors (Orange Blossom, Strawberry, Double Chocolate, etc.). The cupcakes had a great texture and were really delicious. I'd recommend Urban Cookies to anyone.~~#~1
The BEST TEA SHOP on the planet!!!  Super knowledgeable and warm staff.  It's as if this tea shop were in a small town because the staff knows EVERY customer's name.  They aren't pushy with sales either because the tea speaks for itself!!  I have been to many tea shops in my day and I have to say that I have never experienced such a down to earth and authentic shop as Souvia, not to mention such quality tea for such a great price!!~~#~1
Very tasty food.  Extremely pleasant employees.  Great check-ins through the meal and the drinks didn't go dry.~~#~1
How in the world have I not reviewed San Tan?! Since Chandler, Arizona's become a second home, we'd always meant to visit the local microbreweries, especially after seeing a small article about it revolving around small businesses and their handcrafted delights. I think there's like 20 in the valley, with Rock Bottom and BJ's accounting for a good chunk of them. Went to San Tan, got up to the bar, and was greeted by a cute barkeep asking us if we'd ever been there before, and when we said no she started asking us what kind of beer we like and poured a couple samples of their draughts and only charged us when we finally picked what we wanted pints of ($3.75 apiece - happy hour price). The boyfriend got one of the IPAs, and though I'm more of a cider drinker I picked up their hef mixed with pineapple juice, as the bartender suggested. Despite my aversion to pineapple juice (drinking it usually makes my stomach turn, though eating the fruit itself doesn't do this), the two beverages complemented each other nicely. As far as wallet-friendly microbrews go I'd say San Tan's among the best in terms of quality. All the bartenders were pretty cool and casual, and we left feeling a bit on the giddy side so we took a long, looooooong walk around the park area across the parking lot. I think we walked around that column with all the farmers and settlers on it a good 40 or 50 times before we were good to go.~~#~1
Me and my family go here all the time.  It is authentic Mexican Seafood for sure.  I've had several different items and all are great.  Sometimes the service is a little slow (depends on which waitress you get and how busy they are) but the food makes up for it.  Don't worry about not speaking english, go enjoy and you won't regret it.Yes the music is loud and it's always super crowded on Friday and Saturday nights.  If your not from this part of Mesa yes you would think the neighborhood bad but we have never had a problem.Again the food makes up for it all!~~#~1
They say there is nothing new under the sun.  Considering we have lots and lots of sun here in Phoenix, and even more sub shops than days of sunshine, what's one more sub restaurant?Well, I have to say that Port of Subs does it best.  They don't waste their time with cute and gimmicky bread flavors.  They only have white, wheat, and sourdough.  And this is real bread, with some texture and flavor, not some lifeless excuse for generic Wonder Bread.  And you can get a 2 foot sub here, which I can have split up for the whole family.  Their staff is so friendly here, that they will cut it into as many slices as you want, which is great for my kids.  The manager at this location is particularly good.  He goes the extra mile to make sure you get your food how you want it, and he makes you feel welcome from the beginning to the end of your experience.So you ask, "big deal, they have a 2 foot sub here - what really makes them different?"  All meats and cheeses are sliced to order so you know where it comes from and it's not sitting there drying, oxidizing, and degrading all day while sitting out.  This is a huge difference from other places.  The other huge difference is that their bags of chips are bigger, and their standard drink sizes are bigger than any other sandwich place, not to mention the variety of drinks and chips are superior.~~#~1
Sorry ... not impressed with the pizza ... greasy ... could not finish the 1 slice I ordered ... Salad was blah ... free popcorn had no taste, no salt no butter ... blah ... not returning~~#~0
I ordered a dozen brownies as a birthday gift and had it shipped to California. The brownies arrived in an insulated, chilled container and arrived exactly on the day I requested. Each brownie came individually wrapped, which was nice. I was worried they would come open and they wouldn't keep for very long. Every time a new brownie is open I have to sneak a nibble! They have all been so yummy. The caramel one has been my fave so far but I am DYING to try the raspberry one and the mint one. I might have to sneak them out of the refrigerator. They include a coupon for your next order in the box and I will definitely be placing another order!~~#~1
I gave Fast Track full points because of the very cheap rates and excellent customer service. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. They literally pick you up and take you to your car versus making you drag your luggage around the parking lot in 110 degree heat looking for your spot - which I liked allot. The bus that takes you to the airport also drives over to your car to pick you up which I thought was also nice. As far as the rates, a tip: Go directly to their website for cheaper rates. We originally scheduled through some other website and paid an extra $3 per day. Still reasonable, but one of the staff members let us know that we could save a bit by going directly to the site. Thought it was great! would definitely use again!~~#~1
As a New Yorker, I'm always yearning for a good deli experience in the desert. After all, my people wandered around one for 40 years. You'd think we could find a decent nosh!! Anyway, this place ain't it. As pathetic as it sounds, I still can't find anything better than Chompies, and that's a pretty low bar to cross. My wife and I took 4 of our 5 kids (oldest at UofA) and we were hopeful for a taste of NYC as we had been here for breakfast once before and it was decent. Our lunch experience was far from it. I had the special - a skirt steak sandwich. My wife had a half chopped liver sandwich and a cup of soup (can't recall which one). Kids had bagels. Portions were ridiculously small. There were 4 strips of steak on my bread. My wife had an ice cream scoop of chopped liver. Bagels were large, but nothing special. Service was prompt, but devoid of personality. Come on, if you're gonna work at a deli at least give me a little attitude! Anyway, if you're Jonesing for deli, avoid this place. It won't help.~~#~0
Went to Spotted Donkey today and sign says they are closed!~~#~0
Just gave another try last night to see if Saigon is worth to hold my heart, but obviously it is not. To be honest, I've tried real authentic Vietnamese food so if you try the food and you think it's good - then you haven't tried the real food!Since they just changed the owner, quantity is more matter than quality. They just wanted to cook quickly, serve quickly to meet the demand and if someone don't know the real taste then it's their lost!Last night we had to wait more than 15mins for the food to come out. I ordered Pho Tai with beef on the side + xtra beef (because I'd prefer to eat them medium raw) and my bowl came out as a big disappointment: They didn't use eye round steak as advertising - they used some kinda different beef and it made me wanna vomit right in the first bite. I am not talking about the siracha, I'm not talking about bean sprouts, not about any other either - I'm talking about the broth. I just felt like I ate a bowl of boiling water with some MSG!My friend ordered Mi Hoanh Thahn (egg noodles and wonton) - she let me try the broth and both of us agreed that the broth tasted like boil water plus some xtreme fish sauce!I'm not even try to come back here in a mean while - I can get much more than I expected at other places. I just feel bad for those who get deceived by the price and such.. bc they would never know they can enjoy something better than that!Sorry Saigon, but I need to cross your name out of my list!~~#~0
What a GREAT place to pick up some snacks or lunch on the way into or out of the airport. We flew in and out of Phoenix on either end of a car trip. We found this place on Yelp on the way into town, and stopped there again on the way back out because we loved it so much. It's 5-10 minutes from the airport by car. We especially loved the meat pies, the grape leaves, and the spinach pastries. Don't forget to get a tray of baklava from the sweets counter in the back - they were the perfect snack for a road-tripping family.NOTE: the service is pretty slow. Try calling in your order 10-15 minutes before you get there. You might still have to wait in a line at the sandwich counter, but at least it'll save you a few minutes.~~#~1
simply put, I think this is the best Mex restaurant in the valley.  At least of all the ones I have eaten at.Get the guac salad.  SO GOOD!!!Also the mole sauce is to die for and even better their pork in chipotle sauce.  In fact I have eaten their many many times and had nothing less than an exceptional meal.LOVE IT!~~#~1
I've been coming to Yuphas for about three years, and an absolutely addicted to their drunken noodles! Their staff is really quick for lunch service (which comes with a small salad bar and vegetable soup, and spring roll), which is great for a workday lunch. I'm really excited that they're now open for lunch on the weekends too. My friends and I are regulars and the staff always remember our orders and bring us extra hot chili sauce. I highly recommend Yuphas!~~#~1
Bruschetta: GreatWine: GreatAmbiance: GreatPizza: AMAZING. The Crust! The cheese! The Texture! The perfect taste! yum yum yum!  I typically get the Tricolre and sub tomatoes for the meat. But really, anything you choose is going to be AMAZING. I will spend my entire life hoping that I can find another pizza place as good as Cibo, and it will never happen.~~#~1
In a word fantastic.~~#~1
EFF YEAH!!! they have stuff that's been on fire,  they have burritos,  they have sopes and cow heads and big ass bags of roasted hatch peppers and 60 kinds of mexican cheese,   and giant cauldrons of aguas frescas,  and MY FACE IS MELTING RIGHT NOW WHEN I THINK OF HOW GOOD IT ALL IS.  Plus their prices on produce are damn affordable.     So I'm going to get really fat soon apparently,  and it's all Phoenix Ranch Market's fault.~~#~1
Yum yum yum.....yum. Love this place! Excellent food, good wine, awesome atmosphere. Perfect for a drink, perfect for a date, perfect for catch up time with a friend. Perfect.If you don't order the bruschetta, shoot yourself. K don't do that. ALL of them are delicious. DEF pass on the Tuscan bean though (mush), and the Mozz Tom Basil is pretty plain. MY TIP! Order the Chopped Tom and Pesto and ADD mozzerella. BOOM! Soooo good we order double of that everytime. Original...yes and perfection...yes. I could give details on more of the choices, but really ALL of them are wonderful, so order up. And don't worry about their "Choose 4" you can do whatever combination you want, pretty much a la carte.Panini's are awesome for lunch too. LOVE the Chick & Mozz, and if you're up for something a little more rich try the Prosciutto with Brie.Only a couple small issues. 1. wish they would upate their seasonal more often or rotate some new ones in once in awhile. 2. would like a little more of a selection on their by the glass wine options. 3. add some more Spanish wines por favor!The set it up is awesome. Clean and open, nice patio seating, cool corner booth table for larger parties. Great music! Contemporary little accents all around. Sometimes a little wait, but no big deal. We're there a couple times a month!~~#~1
Burrito, after a few bites I discovered I had been chewing on a piece of what appeared to be plastic like cigarette clear wrapping the size of a playing card, the food is always cold, between the food being cold every time I get a burrito there and now foreign objects in the burrito! Come on, its Arizona, there's plenty of better places to get your burrito fix...~~#~0
In from out of town and they helped me out in a bind! Really helpful and I greatly appreciated the extra effort put forth to help me, when I'm not even a paying customer. Thank you!!! :)~~#~1
Amazing food, ultra cozy atmosphere, and a huge patio (a little too cold for the patio tonight). The owner operators are obviously passionate about great food and great cocktails.I had the Scallops and she tried the Pork... both done to perfection. Try the creamed corn with jalapenos for a side!!!The menu is simple yet diverse (steak, chicken, pork, shrimp, scallops and fish), and they also offer nightly specials if you burn through the menu too quickly. Highly recommended for a romantic dinner... I will be back to try lunch next time I'm in the area.This gem is off a side street near 7th and Bethany, and in a courtyard off of that street... Good luck finding it :) *Thanks goes to Groupon for helping me find this place...~~#~1
My Sister-in-law's mom forces her and my brother to take her to Knock Kneed Lobster every time she comes into town from Baltimore.  We met up with them .2 piece fish and shrimp w/chips.  They even have pasta for the vegetarians!  The Mizithra Cheese Pasta was WAY WAY WAY better than The Spaghetti Factory!  We got a side of hush puppies...SOOOO YUMMY!  WAY WAY WAY better than Pete's Fish and Chips (which is still good).There is only 1 problem ... no Diet Coke ....Pepsi products :(~~#~1
I heart you. I don't know why it has taken me so long to write your review, frankly, I'm ashamed of myself. Anywho, I love this place. I dragged the ole ball and chain out on Saturday night for his first time here and we had an amazing evening of meeting and chitchatting.  Everytime I go I have an unforgettable time, the music selection is bomb diggity, they always have an entertaining flick showing, the bartenders are witty, snarky and personable (shout out to Rando and Justin!), great selection of booze, fun crowd of people (in general...I mean, it's impossible to keep a bit of riff-raff troublemakers out of a public bar, but the good thing is that the undesireables only show up once or twice before figuring out that they and their 'tudes aren't really all that appreciated).  All in all, a great neighborhood bar with some deliciously dive-like qualities.~~#~1
Lucky's Pizza is great. This is what Independence is all about. The ability to have an idea and to go out and make it happen. The family of Lucky's pizza is great and there are several locations in the west valley and each one is owned and operated by a family member. Cousin, uncle, brother, Etc. :) It's a great thing. There pizza has a great thin crust with fresh toppings. They get there sausage locally and cook it up fresh in store and then slice it thin on the slicer. no precooked or packaged crap. Real fresh Italian Sausage. It rocks. I highly recommend trying it. The wings have a great sauce and they come out crispy and juicy. They don't disappoint. I am a fan of Lucky's pizza and several other independent pizza joints around town. Arizona is Lucky, to have them. :)~~#~1
Trying to shop at this store for a bra for my 80 year old mother was an exruciating and miserable experience. Troubles began when the salesperson insisted my mother be fitted for a masectomy bra when she hasn't had a masectomy ! When we tried to express our concerns about the poor fit of the bras they were giving her to try on the 2 staff that were present were unresponsive to our concerns and rude. Needless to say we won't be returning. I would advise potential customers to reconsider where they would purchase their lingerie unless they can fit their own bras and don't expect any customer service. The needs of the customer are not a concern for the staff at this place of business.~~#~0
This place was a great surprise.  I thought it would be intimidating based on their website, but I felt immediately at home, they were even welcoming to our sleeping baby.  The server was extremely friendly, and altered everything to be completely veg-friendly for us.  The food was great, and the desserts blew us away.  We were very, very happy with our visit.~~#~1
I can't get enough of the Phoenix Art Museum, I come every few months and always have such a good time. I really enjoy the Philip C. Curtis art, it is probably my favorite part of the museum, but the upstairs is also sweet with the more modern/contemporary art and the fun "firefly" exhibition. I also came most recently to a Heidi Duckler event, if you get a chance to see her dance group here I would definitely recommend it. The only issue I've ever run into is obnoxiously loud guests, which is not the museums fault. You've got to come here if you never have, or if you haven't been in a while, it's a beautiful facility with good staff and some schools get you in for free, and with a good sized gift shop with tons of cool trinkets, you just can't go wrong.~~#~1
Three words: PO ZO LE. The pozole is da bomb. Spicy broth, meat that just melts in your mouth but still has that smoky flavor. I will drive the 6 hours back to Phoenix just to have another taste of this nectar of the gods. Oh yeah, the rest of the food is good too...~~#~1
I have always had trouble finding a great shrimp fried rice in the Valley.  Once I stopped into Yume, I knew I had a favorite!  Most places don't really fry the rice, but Yume does a great job--8 shrimp included for a lunch price of $9.95 which includes a miso soup and salad.I had tried their sushi as well, and have always been impressed.  The owner is always there, rolling sushi and cooking.  He loves talking with his customers, and the service has always been wonderful!It's a little hard to find in the mall, but they are worth it to me!~~#~1
I referred Palmer's to my close friend who was in a pinch and needed a water heater so he can shower!  I met the owner TJ at a networking event earlier this month and having contractor contacts for referrals has been great for me.  He took great care of my friend and had his water heater replaced right away.  They also are contractors that can remodel your home but I like that they will even do smaller jobs so you have one contact for all your contractor needs.  Since the customer service was so great for my friend I have decided to hire them to install a gas line at my home so I can purchase a gas stove instead of using my electric....keep an eye out on my next review to see how that turns out.~~#~1
Hands down the best steakhouse/fine dinning experience in Phoenix.  If you are in the mood for a true experience Durants is the best.  I love entering from the kitchen, it is nice to see where your food is coming from.  The ambiance reminds you of a scene from a 1940's movie, you full on expect Frank Sinatra to sit down next to you and order a martini.  Not to mention that the food and the staff are amazing.  I come here for all my special celebrations and make it a point to let out of town guests experience Durants as well.~~#~1
OMG, this place rocks!  Not only is the pizza fantastic, the staff is friendly and fun and the place itself is very entertaining.  Salads are good too, haven't tried anything else other than the pizza and salad because I love their pizza so much, I can't go int here and not get it ;o)~~#~1
I ordered from hunan Chinese delivery last night and was not impressed at all! I was so dissapointed when I opened it all up. I had gone on here to find a good delivery and this place had good reviews so I thought I'd try it out. The prices are good for what you all get but the quality of the food was terrible. The orange chicken was super soggy and so was the rice. I did enjoy the egg roll though. My husband ordered the teriyaki beef and didn't even want to touch it. He said looking at it just made him want to get sick. Def won't be eating the mounds of leftovers today...~~#~0
I no like.I thought the atmosphere was awful.  Too bright and hospital like for my tastes.I thought the staff was incredibly snotty, inept and downright rude.I thought the wine selection left a lot to be desired.It was cheap because it was happy hour.  We got the cheese plate only to discover that the cheeses were from Trader Joes cheese section, and were rather... commercial and blahIt also came with sliced pepperoni.  Pepperoni?  Really?I just didn't like it.Which is truly a shame, because I was hoping it could become my new wine happy hour staple.   But alas, I'll keep searching....~~#~0
Elegant sushi art at it's finest!. A class unto itself. My FAVE sexy cozy spot.  The fact that they have amazing, and I mean amazing orgasmic food and ambience in this strip mall is crazy! I close my eyes with every bite and melt into my seat. I am so happy I found this little slice of refined sushi heaven. Top notch, top class. Worth finding and worth every single benjamin.~~#~1
Friendly service and a convenient location make this one of my favorites!~~#~1
The BBQ sauce is ketchup-based and sickly sweet. The potato salad tastes like it has Thousand Island dressing in it instead of mayo or mustard. I exchanged the potato salad for "BBQ pit beans" it was so bad. The beans taste like pork & beans from a can with a few kidney and Lima beans thrown in for color. Who serves Lima beans with BBQ? Yuck. If you're from Texas or Kansas City, don't waste your time or money. If I could give zero stars, I would.~~#~0
I was on vacation in Gilbert and wanted to leave a bouquet of flowers for our hosts.  I found Lena's via google and called them at 9:00am.  I asked to order a bouquet that i saw on their web site.  They told me it wouldn't be ready until 2:00pm.  I had to catch a flight at 12:50 so I told them that wouldn't work for me and even explained I had a flight at 12:50pm.  I asked if they had any bouquets already prepared in the cooler and they said yes.  I told them i would take one from there and said I would be on my way to pick it up.  They told me no problem to come on down.  I arrived at 9:45am and waited quite awhile as there were a number of people picking up prom corsages/wristlets.  They were completely disorganized and couldn't fin people's orders.  One was completely wrong so they had to redo it.  When they finally got to me 15 minutes later, the woman at the desk turned to the flower arranger and asked if she was done with my order.  The woman said no, it says "2:00pm" on the order sheet.    At this point I was already late to pick up my family so I told them to forget it and walked out.I realize they were busy with prom orders but they should have staffed the store accordingly.  I would advise people to order flowers elsewhere if they are in Gilbert AZ!~~#~0
I recently flew US Airways from Phoenix to Chicago. It was the bargain on Hotwire so that is what I went with. I cannot complain about the rate... $237 round trip is cheap these days. However, you are nickel-and-dimed for luggage check-in, a coke, snacks, etc. I limited myself  to just one small suitcase, which added $15 each way. (Thankfully I did not exceed the luggage weight or there would have been another fee.) A second suitcase would have been an additional $25.So fair experience overall, HOWEVER, I discovered that passengers can bring cats and dogs on the airplane. Maybe I have been living in a cave, but how is this even possible? First of all I am severely allergic to cats, and I know I am not the only one out there because that is a very common allergy. Guess where the little feline was?! You guessed it, right under my seat. For whatever reason I seemed to not have much of an allergic reaction. I am not sure if it was the recirculated air in the airplane or what. I did ask the flight attendant if they were indeed allowed. She replied with a plastic and enthusiastic smile "Oh yes! We allow cats and dogs and have for quite some time." No doubt she probably had a cat at home. I inquired about the possibility of the animals peeing or worse! Again with the plastic smile, she explained they are in carriers -- as if that solves this biological need. Really????  I don't know about you, but I am not crazy about being trapped 10,000 feet up having to smell cat urine on a 4-hour flight. How is that allowed? How does that meet health codes? Are other airlines allowing this too. Whasssuppp pussycat?!?!~~#~0
Exactly what a bowling alley should be.~~#~1
This is a cool bar. The patio gives it a big edge over Hanny's or Sidebar any day. The inside is clean and inviting (ReBar side). I had the nachos and chicken wings - both were delicious. This is a decent alternative to some of the places downtown and uptown.~~#~1
Okay, so it's not their fault that the parking sucks like no other....it makes me feel like I'm back in L.A. though!The atmosphere here is fun. It's noisy, it is great for people watching and there are a lot to see (and, if you're like me, BUY)The staff always seems to be smiling, and are helpful when asked, BUT this will never be the Nordstrom of restaurants.So here are the things you have to try! They are WONDERFUL!Mia's French PancakesCroque MadamCommuter Sandwich (either with avacado or salmon, both are great)Jersey Girl OmeleteThe Cubano SandwichThe RuebenGuacamole BLTI forget the name, but its either a Spanish or a Mexican Latte is wonderful!I also love the little pickle slices  they serve!! So good!The Tammy Coe cakes are so good too! I love the designs! very creative use of fondant!~~#~1
(Testing out this new iPhone app!) Carry the world's problems on my shoulders has been a pain in the neck, so I began investigating my AZ State health insurance plan to see what I could get, before I get canned or before AZ decides to discard all benefits and lower wages so McCain and Sheriff Joe can buy bigger guns.  Coworker recommended this place, Dr. Genet is great, staff friendly, low copay. Weight of the world...still there, but body (and mind) is better able to deal!~~#~1
A must visit anytime your anywhere near Scottsdale! The wait can be long, but, find a place at the bar and enjoy the wait!!You can't miss If you try the roasted chicken and rib combo. Also gotta get an artichoke....its fire roasted!!U~~#~1
So......disappointed after everything I have heard about this place.  We have a great work team and we are always planning HH around Mill Ave. as we work in the vicinity.  So, to get our group to stray and try something new, we thought Thirsty Lion a few miles away Tempe Marketplace.  I was really excited about HH starting at 3pm,  So, at 3:30ish, no one is there...few people at the bar, the high tops all have a reserve sign.  First, few team members to arrive, try to get a seat for our group...and we are asked about  our reservations. WHAT! on a Tuesday?  All the high top seating are vacant.  Anyhow, they did let us have one of the high tops.  So, now we are ready to order our HH specials.  Remember....there is no one there.  It took forever to get our drinks, they had nice options with their HH food menu, so we order a couple appetizers.  They were really nothing special.  So, I order the pretzel...looks interesting w/the beer batter sauce.  So, I am waiting , waiting, waiting....had to order a wine...I'm waiting, waiting, waiting.  Finally, I asked where is my wine...oh, it's coming.  How about my pretzel order.....the waitress forget to put the order in.  She did ask if I wanted her to put the order in, I said, no.  Now, I am ready to leave and a friend and I close out our tab.  I give her my credit card, that took forever too. The bill was incorrect.....she switch our tab and put the incorrect amount on my card...so now she has to reverse it. REALLY?It took awhile to get out of here.  As some of our team members arrived at 5ish the place got really busy.  They would put in their orders, but no drinks 10 mins later still waiting.  Finally, they just had to go to the bar and get their beers.  It was a very disappointing experience.  I guess we will stick with the Mill Ave. area.  Too bad I'll never try the pretzel.~~#~0
Time after time, I visit this little gem in the Carefree area, and find that the food is consistent - quantity and quality wise!  I continue to send family and friends to Sesame Inn when I hear they plan visit AZ.Sure there isn't "lo mein" on the menu, but if you actually know your Chinese food like I do, you'll realize that this isn't a Cantonese style restaurant -- where lo mein is usually served.  I'm just sayin'...~~#~1
Terrible flight. Unaccompanied kids crawling on me, spilling drinks, throwing games. Contacted US Airways repeatedly, wouldn't offer _any_ material compensation whatsoever for 4.5h of discomfort. Their official policy is that if you get from point A to point B they don't care what happens in between. Avoid, awful.~~#~0
What an extraordinary resort this is. One of a kind that will never be forgotten. Built into the side of a mountain to co-exist with it.   Natural and architectual beauty wherever you look. Even in the cafe which has an exposed boulder face for a wall with a great view of the surrounding area. There I surely room for improvement with respect to the food. They can't cook a burger properly, but they sure make a a great egg white omlette.~~#~1
I had an emergency just 30 minutes before they closed and despite having a full schedule, they made the room for us to see one of the top docs.   Not only did every staff member come by and love-up my very uncomfortable boxer-baby; but they took several hours to give him the most thorough work-up ever!    My previous vets would have gouged me with high fees and/or unnecessary tests for a last minute emergency like this;  so imagine my delight to hear them suggest very sensible tests under a price schedule that was surprisingly reasonable.  In fact, the final invoice was BELOW what they quoted me in the room!    Doggy and Daddy are very happy; and planning to make AAWC out new regular vet.~~#~1
What an incredible way to end our Spring Break trip to AZ!  We got to see our beloved Texas Rangers beat the Dodgers on a beautiful afternoon and then we had the best meal, service and hospitality EVER at Zing!  Our party of 5 enjoyed 3 cheese grilled cheese, monte cristo, mac and cheese and those ever-tantilizing sweet potato fries with tiger sauce.  We loved it all.   James, the owner, and our server  made us feel like family and the chef even came out to talk to us.  We HIGHLY recommend Zing for the food, atmosphere, drinks (something James whipped up special for us) and all at a cost that made it a tremendous value.  Don't miss this spot the next time you are ANYWHERE near the Phoenix area.~~#~1
Love.  This.  Place.~~#~1
First off, they don't even deliver! Wtf!! Pizza is hands down the worst in surprise. Ate there once and that was enough for us. Service was horrible. Dominos is way better~~#~0
This past Saturday was my second visit to Roka Akor, first time with my husband, second with my sister. Both times we had exceptional service and food. First time we had the tasting menu and while I don't remember much of what we ate (it was a lot!), I do remember everything was delicious.My sister is visiting and she loves sushi so I knew she had to try Roka. We ordered the scallops appetizer, a salmon roll, unagi roll, sweet corn, mushrooms, BBQ crispy rice, teriyaki chicken and black cod. Everything was absolutely amazing! The flavors, the presentation, the aroma. The salmon roll was ridiculously good, a nice piece of salmon atop the roll, fresh and melting in your mouth. We barely even talked while eating because we wanted to enjoy the food:) My sister doesn't like fish (only raw) and I had to keep her away from my black cod! Oh! And the drinks are amazing too! It is pricey but very much worth it~~#~1
My favorite pizza, alas, since moving to the east coast in '01 it's a rare treat afforded only on trips home.  Seriously, though, Barro's has the best chewy flavorful crust and sauce.  They are generous with the cheese and veg (my preferred toppings) and the veg are fresh and tasty.This Greek style pizza they have out east just can't compare to a little taste of home.~~#~1
Could not ask for a better place!~~#~1
This is real Central/Southern Mexican food--del Distrito Federal.  If you don't know what that means, you probably have no concept of real Mexican food (and FYI, burritos are NOT real Mexican food) and need to travel outside of the resorts in Rocky Point, Cancun, Acapulco, etc.  My wife (del D.F.) and I are here every weekend because this is the real deal.  The tortas are equivalent to (and, in some cases, much better than) those to be found in Mexico City (and yes I can say that from experience).  Their quesadillas, sopes, and huaraches are huge and are on-par with everything we've found in el D.F. and el Edo. de Michoacan.  Not sure how they can mimic the authentic taste of la masa de maiz here in the USA, but they certainly pull it off.  All ingredients are fresh, and the meats are juicy and delicious.  Ceviche is top-notch.  If you do want to Gringo/Norteno out, they do have burritos with green and red chile sauceand flour tortilla quesadillas.  Atmosphere is friendly and clean--this is not gourmet, but not a hole-in-the-wall either.  The original 7th Street location is the best we've found in the entire US--bar none.  The Western location leaves a little to be desired in terms of taste and service.  Plenty of wait staff fluent in both English and Spanish, so be patient and they'll take great care of you!  CANNOT GIVE A HIGHER RECOMMENDATION!!!~~#~1
I can't believe the reviews that this place has received so far!  WOW!!I concede, yes it is very expensive when compared to other gyms, but a BMW is expense when compared to a Ford....In my life I've belonged to The Courthouse (tiny gym), LA Fitness, ASU Student Rec Center, Q Fitness (now 24 hour fitness) and the YMCA and I can honestly say that all pale in comparison to this facility.  Quick disclaimer: Not all LifeTime Fitness centers are the same!  The one in Gilbert is great, but not as amazing as this facility.  When I moved to MN (home of LifeTime Fitness) I actually plotted out where we would live based on the proximity to one of their gyms.  The closest one to me is in no way comparable to the facility in Tempe and as a result we are no longer members.  If I lived even remotely close to a facility like this one I would join again in a heartbeat.  Now on to the review.My wife actually signed us up under the family plan without me around.  When she told me how much it was (~$90/month for the entire family) I was a bit put back.  But after my first visit I felt the money was well spent and that we were even getting a deal!I often describe this facility as a "country club".  Everything about this place is just amazing.Locker Rooms - Incredibly well appointed with a ton of space, a lounge, sauna and steam room.  The lockers are large and their card/key system saves a lot of time for those of us that always forget to bring a lock with them.Cardio - There's no way anyone can complain about this!  Even at peak times there are almost always machines available in every category (treadmill, bike, elliptical, etc).  The machines are well maintained and the abundance of large screen TVs will keep you distracted from your achy legs.Weight Machines - You name it, they have it.  There are more here than I would ever use, but if you want to work that little muscle that connects those two things that you n ever use, they probably have a machine here to do it.Free Weights - They have a ton of free weights with some set-ups that I have yet to find in other facilities.  Plenty of space to workout and plenty of weights for everyone to use.Basketball - Two full size courts that are open and clean.  Great courts to play on.Squash - Probably my one complaint is that they have squash courts and no racquetball courts.  Of course most would argue that squash is more technical than racquetball and I should get some skill and stop bitching.Rock Climbing - Probably one of the most underused aspects of the gym.  I rarely saw people on this, but is was a heck of a set-up!Tennis - This was extra and since I'm not much of a tennis player I didn't sign up for this feature, but it seemed like a nice facility.Pool - Indoor and outdoor pools, so you can swim all year long.  The outdoor pool had some AMAZING "scenery" during the warmer months.  I wouldn't go so far as to compare it to a Vegas hotel pool, but it was darn impressive!Kid Zone - This is one of the things that sold it for us.  The facility for kids was outstanding, with separate areas set up for different ages and an abundance of activities and areas for all kids.  Indoor, lower hood basketball.  Outdoor play area.  Huge indoor "jungle gym".  Computers.  Crafts.  This truly was an amazing part of the gym.  And the great thing is, if you want to relax instead of work out, this aspect of the gym becomes even more helpful!  You want to get a haircut and a massage?  Drop the kids off and head to the spa!  You want to sit back and relax?  Drop the kids off and head to the pool or hot tub.  The kids look forward to it and it's great for the parents!Spa - My wife used this more than me and was happy with the experiences that she had here.  We didn't use it as much as we could have, but no complaints.Cafe - Decent food for a little cafe in a gym.  I ate many a breakfast there on my way to work after a cardio session.  Overall I just don't think that I've ever been in a better gym.  Yes it's expensive, but even at a higher price I feel as if I always got a good deal for the money I spent.~~#~1
The Barrio Cafe is a "best of" Phoenix. Oh my, that guacamole made at your table is fantastic.  Who knew that pomegranate could make it taste so good.  All the dishes - especially the slow roasted pork - are excellent.  We're never disappointed.  Great south of the border food right here in Arizona - highly recommended.~~#~1
This is a great place for gelato!!! They make their own gelato on site, the owner has a degree from Gelato university in Italy. This is real authentic Italian gelato...really one of the best I have tasted. I bought a cone with pistachio and the chocolate cookie flavour...was yummy!Forget about the Gelato spot -- i tried their pistachio and it was not authentic gelato! Spread the word on Cool Gelato  - will def go there again on my next trip to Phoenix. They were a little hard to find but definitely worth looking for!~~#~1
Spectacular!  You definitely get what you pay for at Elements.  The pork chop with cherry garlic glaze and the Foie Gras appetizer are superb.  Our waiter Jim was great!   It was an outstanding experience!~~#~1
Wow.  The perfect combination of creative and authentic.  Small, funky, hip and intimate.  Great service, killer ingredients, and a fun atmosphere.  We literally loved this place; oh, and we are serious foodies.  Guacamole was a fresh spin on a classic, yet truly scrumptious.  We devoured it.  Tacos - slow roasted Mayan pork - were crazy delicious.  The serving was 4, with double corn tortillas, so I divided them and made 8 tacos - holy mackerel, they were good!  My wife won the Mexican food lottery, however: Chile Relleno Nogales or something like that.  It was sweet and spicy; a chile stuffed with cheese, fruit, nuts, and lightly layered in a sweet, nutty sauce.  Literally the best Mexican dish I've ever tasted (including in Mexico itself).  It combined the best of savory and sweet.  We didn't leave a single morsel on the plate.  Amazing.  Tip:  order a simple margarita (off the menu), with tequila, lime and agave nectar.  So simple, yet so tasty.~~#~1
Postinos little sister! Went here for lunch very good! The staff was friendly and the prices were good!~~#~1
My dear friend and I went to Season's 52 for lunch.  Ken was our server and he made the whole experience especially wonderful.  Great food, comfy booth and very pretty surroundings.  If you go, ask for Ken.  He is personality plus and he will make sure you enjoy every minute of your dining experience.  I love the menu and its variety of choices to suit various dietary preferences.~~#~1
I took my husband to Famous Dave's a couple days ago for a quick dinner since I was in no mood to cook. We always like to sit at the bar instead of a table, mainly because its easy to watch a few sports events and get our order in fast. We quizzed each other on trivia questions from the Trivial Pursuit cards that are sittting on the bar. I took a look at the menu and even though I LOVE their brisket, I was in a ribs mood. I can never eat a half slab, so I got the 4 bone rib meal. Saw they have some new sides, so I decided to try the green beans with potatoes and spicy mac and cheese. My husband ordered the same sides as me and the half slab. Our food came out pretty quick and it was a nice surprise to see they gave me 5 ribs instead of 4 :). The mac and cheese is my absolute fave now. It had pieces of jalapeno in it and gave it a great kick, but not overly spicy. The cheesy mac was creamy and delish. I did like the green beans with red potatoes, though I kinda miss the regular firecracker green beans. Of course, the ribs were so good they fell off the bone. I enjoy the Devil's Spit BBQ sauce, though the ribs were pretty saucy by themselves. I always save the cornbread muffin for "dessert"...though next time I might try to save room for the always scrumptious Bread Pudding, which is to die for.We had a nice meal and I was satisfied with my BBQ fix.~~#~1
I have been to this location on several occasions thinking I would give this place the benefit of the doubt, but boy was I wrong. The prices are great, but the food is NOT. All three times I have gone to this location the people that worked there had messy work outfits/uniforms and smelt like smoke. They also had dirty fingernails and were acting very unprofessional. The first time I went there the pizza tasted like dirt and another time it was still doughy. I love Little Caesars, just not this location.~~#~0
Love the vig, I just wish a few less people did too!  It can be tough to get a seat after work but it always seems to work out.  Parking is a pain.  You can either go to the free valet (just tip them when you leave) or park across the street.  If you have an extra couple buck I'd suggest the valet.  Quick, easy and frankly it makes me feel "special".Happy hour is stellar and everything I've had there is great.  Burgers, wings, salmon.Great beer selection and even better patio.  If you read my reviews you will quickly notice a theme of 4 things...  1. Love bars 2. Love patios 3. Love food 4. Love my wifeThis place satisfies all.  They have bocci ball to boot.Grab a cocktail, put on some shades and loung in one of their comfy chairs.Oh - staff is always on point from the bartenders to the bus boys.Oh - (another one, sorry) I heard the owner opend a bar called Little Woodys down the street.  Haven't been but if its the same guy I'm sure its a nice spot.~~#~1
This is one of my favorite places to eat.  It has the best chicken fried chicken I have ever had, and the mashed potatoes are excellent.  The salad is simple yet delicious.  The thing with Texaz grill is that I believe you can only go there and order 2 things off of their menu.  They are famous for the chicken fried chicken and the chicken fried steak, this is what you must order, and this is what everyone comes back for. If you are not a fan of these 2 items, then this place is not for you. Everything else on the menu is just average.  The portions are huge, you can easily split an order with someone, or take half of your meal home for left overs, which I think is a great value.  The decor is like a in the middle of nowhere Texas bar,  it's not fancy, and it's not meant to be.~~#~1
It is right across the street from where I work. Everyone is always so friendly and nice. The food has always been perfect and have amazing chocolate chip cookies. It's nice having a little local place such as this.~~#~1
The two beers I had here last night were both great, particularly the vanilla porter, which I finished in about three minutes.  I also had fish and chips, and that too was excellent.  The fish was lightly breaded and perfectly crispy and delicious.  The bartender that served me was as nice as she was attractive.  Happy hour starts at 11, not 10 (as some places say).  The normal prices are good for beer (4.25) and the happy hour prices (3.25) are amazing. There was a very good crowd at 11 on a Thursday night and the large porch was particularly full.~~#~1
Horrible service!My friends and I (party of 6) arrived at 7:00 and were told it would be a 30 to 35 minute wait.  At 7:50 we were finally seated.  Next, my friends ordered sushi and I ordered a chicken salad. Big mistake.  All of the sushi came out at different times, and finally at 8:25 I asked where my salad was. 8:35 the server comes back and says they accidentally cooked it with dark meat and asked if I still wanted it with white meat, to which I replied yes, I wanted it with white meat. (My friends were done eating at that point.) He then unapologetically stated that will be another 10-15 minutes.  8:50 he brings out the salad and I ask for a fork. 8:55 he comes back with cheater chopsticks and tells me they are all out of forks.I mean REALLY?!?Long story short, my friend stood up for me and told them to comp my salad, which they did, but the manager never came out to apologize.  And no, I did not eat my salad with chopsticks; I took it home to eat instead.  Good food.  It's a shame they have such lousy service.~~#~0
Love this place, exactly what I have been looking for!! I have taken a number of different classes and I am hooked. I'm in my 30's and was looking for a dance studio that was not to serious, but provides a good workout (no recitals). This is a great place to get some exercise and have fun doing it!~~#~1
The quintessential local spot that is hip, excellent food & service. But like an eariler review states it is cool but "not trying to hard".  A great place for groups or smaller parties. It definitely gets busy, and parking is vallet.  Just a great sense of style, taste and casual place to just hang out.Excellent food, a great combination of different flavors and styles.  Service was excellent, prompt and attentive.  Full bar, excellent wine menu and beer selection.The salads are excellent, very generous portions,and combinations of flavors.  Make sure you always ask about the specials.  Absolutely incredible.  Generous portions, you will be happy you popped by!~~#~1
This place pretty much rocks! Our friends introduced us to the place last night. Our experience was so exciting that we went again today for lunch. The first meal was a philly burger, amazing, and a gyro burger, an another amazing! Both burgers were spot on with big flavor! The burgers are great, but the other thing that made the place pop for me was the selection of artisan sodas. The place has a giant selection of sodas that are so rare to find. I'm from Maine and they had Moxie. I can't get Moxie soda anywhere here in the valley, that is except at Rocket Burger! This review isn't for the soda Moxie, it is definitely an acquired taste. Rocket Burger on the other hand is not a place that has to grow on you. You'll fall in love with it right away.~~#~1
I've been here twice for brunch and it's great! My carnivorous son got the steak and eggs and it looked pretty high quality. My girl likes the Chilaquiles and I've enjoyed the vegetarian omelet and I totally vouch for the Huevos Rancheros.I'm excited to head there for lunch or dinner to try the margaritas and something that's not on the brunch menu.~~#~1
Professional body piercing. That is an important phrase people. Body piercers who are first aid certified, cpr trained and could essentially work in a doctors office. Because these people are putting things under your skin, its important that they know what they are doing!The staff at HTC knows what they are doing. It is one of the most comfortable shops to get piercings done I have ever been. They have awesome jewelry and an awesome ability to explain what goes into a piercing and how the body will react to the damage being done. They do not do tattoos, or use piercing guns, or sell t-shirts, bongs, or any of a hundred other things that I have seen in other grimy piercing places. This place rocks!~~#~1
If you are looking for REAL NY pizza, then look NO FURTHER than Ray's!!! My first time there I was taken by my Mom, who obviously has GREAT TASTE, and told it is the "BEST PIZZA IN TOWN!" And no truer words have been spoken about a pizza joint! The pies have HUGE slices! The employees are TRUE BLUE New Yorkers!And BEST OF ALL...... GREAT TASTING PIZZA!!! You've got to try it to believe it......I guarantee you won't feel the same way about pizza!~~#~1
Love it - great location close to work and I had a great gel manicure. Friendly service and great pricing!~~#~1
Urban Cookies - I love you.  Ollie Cakes - I REALLY love YOU! I am a girl with a massive sweet-tooth.  There is nothing better sounding to me that a shop that sells nothing other than cookies and cupcakes (well, and drinks, of course).  Most cupcakeries are a huge disappointment to me - overpriced and underwhelming.  Ollie Cakes, on the other hand, are scrumptious! They are reasonably priced (so I never feel bad when I get 2...), and seriously the most delicious in town.  I especially love the carrot cake flavor.  Mmmm. Must go back.  Daily.  Hmm... maybe that would be bad for me?~~#~1
The only thing you need to know about this place is that it's the best dim sum you can get in Phoenix.  Do yourself a favor and go try it.~~#~1
I used to watch New Scandinavian Cooking on PBS just for the girl in the pigtails. Now, I find that I should have also been paying attention to the cooking, too! All the five star reviews are totally warranted - incredible Scandinavian dishes, friendly family service, and a low price point. Best new cheap eats place I've been to this year.~~#~1
There are very few places I can wander into and meet people I know well, each from a different personal life zone of mine.  Lola on Roosevelt is one of them.  A true "3rd place" I suppose - especially since I live over 6 miles away.The coffee is chosen, roasted, ground and cooked with the obsessive passion that we've known and loved the past 10 years at all 4 "3rd places" - Lux, Lola Tapas, Lola on Central and now here.  The barristas are elegantly poised professionals who can handle crowd "spikes" calmly and rapidly - a very rare and precious talent [why is it done in these places so consistently?].  The confections have always been excellent - I wish the grains weren't so highly refined is my only quibble there.  The old building is just perfect!  What they've done to it makes the space achingly exquisite.  And comfortable.  And comfortingly urbane.I wish I lived next door.~~#~1
Staff friendly, rooms very clean. Dining is upper scale but it is a resort. Food is very good, with no complaints. There is additional dining within minutes outside of the resort. I came here for a conference and had a terrific time while here.~~#~1
If you can avoid going to this hospital I would STRONGLY recommend doing so. Your wait time in the ER will be at least 2 hours and then another hour waiting for someone to come see you. If they start you on antibiotics, you can expect another 60 minute wait for your medicine. We had a recent incident that I can't go in to for privacy reasons but all I can say is potential lawsuit. Every time I have come to this hospital there is a hassle, staff always takes the path of least resistance, and are sometimes just downright unhelpful. I have also heard horror stories from other people about Del Webb. I'm normally not a complainer and usually have great experiences wherever I go, but it has been one thing after another with this place. If you can, drive another few miles to Arrowhead, Estrella, or Thunderbird. Even though they are all Banners, Del Webb must not invest in their staff or just don't care but whatever the case is, compassion and care is not anywhere on their list of priorities.~~#~0
This is a "must" visit whenever we are in Scottsdale - always a great experience. LOVE the Grilled Artichokes and Wild Mushroom Soup (when you can get it!) and the WCG Bacon Blue Cheese Salad too.  Too many great choices, so little room in the stomach!~~#~1
This is a great place to meet someone for work or just to hang out in on weekends.  It's a little bit loud, but I actually think the coffees are quite good.  They make great Christmas coffees.  I've never had a problem finding a seat either.  Tip, if you go during the week during mid-morning and mid-afternoon, you won't have any noise problems.  Now that the kids are back in school, it's awesome!If it's too loud inside, and not too hot outside, you can grab a seat on the patio.  And you can't beat the free Wi-Fi.  This saved my butt during one recent meeting.I have noticed on the weekend that the patio turns into a see and be seen scene, but what part of Scottsdale (Phoenix really in this case) isn't?~~#~1
One of my big pet peeves is when people review restaurants and bitch about how dingy, etc. it is before talking about what's really important.  the food. After all, you can see what you are getting into from the parking lot and ya still went in!!!!!My pet name for places like Los Cerritos is 'El Divo', pronounced with a loooong 'i', and one of the things you can usually count on from little dives is great food. Los Cerritos doesn't disappoint. We pulled into the drive-thru yesterday morning, ordered breakfast and were treated to cheesy melty goodness wrapped up in fresh flour tortillas. My Bacon-Egg-Cheese Burrito had more bacon than anything else in it, a two fisted fattie just waiting to be crowned with green sauce. J's steak and egg burrito looked just as good. He asked me if I wanted a bite and with eyes glazed over I looked at him and said "naw, I'm doing just fine here on my own..." The dog drooled as we drove away, two hungry Mexican foodie fans quietly chewing their way to Nirvana.P.S. that trip to Nirvana is available anytime thanks to the giant "OPEN 24 HOURS" sign you can see from a block away ;-)~~#~1
Many of the businesses in this area of the city are converted houses and Made is what started it all. It is my understanding that they got the idea of buying dilapidated houses, fixing them up real nice, and turning them into neat little shops, restaurants, and bars. Kudos indeed!Made itself sells unique books, hand-made and other cool cards, cool artist-made jewelry, some artist-made and small label clothing, and art from local artists. The people who work there also know the area really well, and are more than happy to suggest other businesses in the area.~~#~1
Awesome food and great service!~~#~1
Zen Buffet in Glendale Arizona:  Run away.  Fast.  Am usually the kind of guy that can find the silver lining in almost any situation i.e; "our server was a most *excellent* mouth-breather..." - but as I write this review I still remain unable to find any redeeming quality whatsoever.  It should be known:#1:  I'm a guy;#2:  I'm single parent w/ kids;#3:  I can be Stalin-esque when it comes to buffets i.e; "quantity has a quality all its own' - which should be a godsend to ownership when rating a buffet.  My expectations are low to start.As such, I am also very forgiving regarding buffets.  Food doesn't have to be awesome for a passing grade from my boys and I - it just can't suck.  Same thing with service:  If we're missing a place setting or salt - I'm the kind of guy who will just snag one off a neighboring table - and still tip.  Place has to reeeally go below and beside the call of duty to rate a negative (and yet I'll still tip...but that's how I roll  :-)Zen Buffet - how much do I love thee?  I'd planned on making  list thanks to the generous 15% off Zen was offering if you mentioned "Yelp" - but alas, we've yet to find a thing.  What we *did* notice however is as follows:1.  My boys and I have renamed the restaurant "The Dancing Queen", as this was the *only* song that played repeatedly for the 1st 44 minutes we were there.  We were having fun watching and listening to the folks around us as they would come to the same sudden realization :-p2.  Much of the food was empty i.e; crab legs (Hey: at $12 for dinner, I'd like to have the crab legs as advertised!).  I asked the attendant  refilling the food *twice* if she would pleease refill it.  It took asking the gentleman who was seating up front to get anything crab legs - and then the other patrons were busy waiting in the wings gobbled them all up in about 90 seconds.  Never refilled again either. Oh HEY:  I actually *can* say something good about this place:  They refill the rice and noodles quite well!  But now back to it:3.  One of my favorite dishes - salt & pepper shrimp - was misidentified and not available despite signage indicating otherwise.  The salt & pepper frogs legs were as advertised - just ultra weak in the spice and ultra old.  The shrimp in the bin that had the 'salt & pepper shrimp' sign was red.  And breaded.  And cold.  Health department?!?4.  The lo mein noodles were bland and devoid of any flavour whatsoever, as were the rice noodles.  And the creepy looking fried rice (bright yellow) was so hard, bland and cold that we spat it out.  1st time.  Ever.  5.  The wonton soup had not wontons (picked out);  no baked scallops in the 'baked scallop" (it was chopped 'krab' that was baked in a scallop shell).It took us that long (and $40 bucks) to realize it was time to leave.I decided to take one quick walk back around the sushi spot.  Like before, most of it was out.  The sashimi on the far left side of the line looked like it had been cut and set out the day before yesterday.  Quite unappealing and I was actually afraid to touch it.  Felt I owed yelp a review due to the 15%, and I really feel bad for the ownership who will in all likelihood be out of business soon.  And the summer hasn't even started.  Looking forward to my first *real* review when I can report on a place that I actually want to go to (vs. hungry boys who spotted this place again as we were driving by today).  Off the cuff review here, forgive the spelling/tense/general spaciness.  We're still hungry - but for something edible :-o~~#~0
I really love coming to Postino.  They have great food, a great selection of wine and a trendy atmosphere.  The restaurant itself is pretty open and airy, but when it gets packed in there, it gets PACKED.Postino definitely isn't lacking for customers- that's for sure.  My favorite things on the menu are as follows:The olive appetizer (I LOVE olives), the cheese course, the bruschetta (you get to pick a few ingredients to put on it and it's amazing), the vegetarian panini and the warm chocolate tarte. I've never had a bad food or wine experience at Postino, and I could tell that the staff is highly trained on all menu items and the wine they offer- which is a refreshing change. Our server also recommended a really good dessert wine to go with the tarte, and it was fantastic. I wish I could remember the name of it, but I can't.~~#~1
Our neighborhood, locally-owned sushi place and NOT a chain (as someone suggested in another review). I had to weigh in because we have been going to Ichi Ban for 7 years and the owner, Seth, and his staff have been consistent, attentive and friendly. And the sushi is fresh, creative and tasty in my opinion. Order something off the "specials" menu posted on the wall and you can't go wrong with the spicy tuna. It also isn't as expensive as other sushi restaurants and there are other menu options for land lovers. Great sushi place for lunch or dinner and right on the light rail.~~#~1
The Italians....not only do they have the best food, some of the best wines, the most beautiful country-side....but now its confirmed...the best dessert...GELATO!!....what can be next??I cant believe that this place has been here for 3 years....and its within walking distance to my own fort. These 2 italian women are definitely onto something here. This little shop has about 30 different flavors... so far I have tried the Tobblerone, Dolce Latte and Spagnola (eggnog!).....I will be back to try the 27 other flavors!~~#~1
Damn! This stadium is straight up legit! The stadium is beautiful and you have so much lawn space to spread out and enjoy the game!They have an insane amount of options for food and drink so you're bound to find something you like. And after you enjoy a couple margs or beers at the game, you can hop on over to Old Town to continue the fun!~~#~1
When I first moved to the area 2 years ago I had to find a place that had Bulgogi.  I searched but never found a place I liked.  A neighbor introduced me to this spot and I am now a regular patron...  I usually seat myself (if I come alone) and the owner never gives me a menu.  I've tried most everything on the menu but I always come back to Bulgogi, Galbi and Bibimbap.  It is kind of pricey but the food has a homemade feel.  The ambiance of the restaurant is nice, too.~~#~1
I would have written a 5-star review about Spinato's anyway, but after an experience this weekend, I had to Yelp about it ASAP....  I drove from Mesa just to pick up pizza for my family (yes, it's that good), and when I was getting in my car to leave, I was holding the pizza and the box caught the corner of my rear-view mirror.  The entire large pizza spilled in the front seat of my car, all over the console, gear shift, seat, floor, etc.  It was a mess!  I tried to clean it up, but I really needed soap and water, so I went in to ask for some napkins.  The manager, Tim, overheard me ask and asked what happened.  When I explained, he immediately got me wet towels to clean up the mess and made me a new pizza, free of additional charge!  He obviously didn't have to do that, as it was not Spinato's fault in any way.  Plus, the place was packed (as usual), but he bumped my pizza to the front of the line.  If I wasn't convinced before that Spinato's is the BEST-- not just for food taste but for customer service-- I would be sure of it now!Things to get:  the Sicilian pizza.  It's thick and awesome.  Order jalapenos on top.  They are a nice balance to the sweet sauce.  Also, get the starter salad and the raspberry vinaigrette dressing-- it's tart and perfect.Something unique:  the spaghetti-filled calzone.  Yep, you heard me-- carbs baked inside of carbs!  :)The servers are great, the management is great, the location is great (easy parking and plenty of it, including street parking), and the food is SO WONDERFUL!  Try one of their multiple locations throughout the valley-- you won't be disappointed.Tip:  they don't take lunch reservations, but if you get there earlier than your appointed time, they have no problem pulling together multiple tables for larger groups.~~#~1
Ate here months ago for the first time. Just now getting around to the review. Service was efficient and friendly. I ordered "to go" and they gave me an extra flatbread/bun on the side, just in case the dog they prepared got soggy. I ordered the veggie dog, toppings were generous and tasty.~~#~1
This place is definately a dive! Its small, run down, dated, and unclean. Ive been twice now, and both times were not by choice. Both times, my water glass had nasty stuff on the outside and inside. Very disgusting. Their tacos are puny, expensive and flavorless. Their guacamole just tasted weird almost like there was too much lime juice in it. Oh and those pictures that are posted on here are not accurate examples of what you get from LuLu's. Everything is tiny and doesnt have much color. This place does not impress me whatsoever and I about cry each time someone suggest that we go   :(~~#~0
This place is awesome!The service is excellentThe food is excellent, they have every kind of burrito you can think of, this place is really authentic.My kids and I go at least twice a month and are always satisfied, they have amazing portions and the taste is great!Their rest rooms always clean.Highly recomend~~#~1
"Viad Tower Restaurants" First off, I'm not sure that this is the correct name for the restaurant.  I will tell you that this is the restaurant on the second floor of the Viad tower in Midtown Phoenix.  What a great find.  This is a nice upscale cafeteria style restaurant.  Everything is Homemade from carved sandwiches to pizza and daily specials.  It was Chicken Enchiladas yesterday.  I had a tossed Cobb Salad that they made and tossed in front of me.  It was great and huge.  I could not finish it.The prices are very reasonable.  I will be back next time I'm in the neighborhood!~~#~1
Eat and you will see 8 )  The Shoppe Tacos are the Bomb & you can only get here!!!!Mike will set you up...~~#~1
Oh my goodness the food was amazing! Pesto and sourdough bread, artichokes and greens were so good!~~#~1
The husband wanted a motorcycle.  We bought a motorcycle.  And then we went shopping for insurance.  It was time to find someone who could cover my 2 cars, the house, and the motorcycle.  After multiple quotes, Scott came out on top as the best price for motorcycle insurance.  Here's the kicker - we never insured the bike and ended up selling it but we kept Scott!  Scott made great recommendations on the coverage to get for the car - so much so, when someone decided to total my car for me it saved us so much heartache!  State Farm was all over it.  We became the poster children for under-insured insurance!  Not saying he would do this for anyone - but when the fuel pump went out in my truck, Scott himself picked me up, picked up my kids from daycare, and took us home.  WAY ABOVE anyone's responsibilities - probably really likes us too - who knows :)  I'm just saying he is WAY more than good neighbor - he's a friend.~~#~1
Took two girlfriends here who had never been here...everything was perfect. I got the Filet Mignon which is smothered in green and red peppers and onions and placed on a corn tortilla which is covered in cheese with fresh slices of avocado with a side of black beans and rice pilaf! While my friends had the new york strip steak and the some other 3 cheese entree. The food was all amazing the service was excellent. I finally got to see the Mariachi player play guitar and enjoyed the ambiance of this place very much...I almost didn't want to Yelp about this place...and wanted to keep it a secret...but I would rather that people go all carrot mob on this place so it stays in business. One of the best places I have been to eat in phoenix. Truly deserving of it's five stars rating.~~#~1
My third time here and all kept getting more disappointing than the previous. The pizza has a rock-hard crust. First visit I had the roasted mushroom pizza. I really don't want al dente fungus on a pizza. Second visit I had the Mac n Cheese. You have to step your game up for Mac n Cheese in this neighborhood. I guess if you like really salty Mac n Cheese, this is your place. Third visit, the egg pizza. Seriously, after being open for a couple months, have your oven dialed in so not to dislocate your jaw trying to eat the crust. Total disappointment for a needed neighborhood pizza joint. They do have good beer prices for happy hour. That's a positive.~~#~0
I just bought a home nearby this hidden gem and have been back several times since I moved in. The tortas are a go-to but honestly, everything I've ordered has been better than expected.  Even the simple bean burrito con queso is better than most places I've been.  Enjoy!~~#~1
Its been a long time since I've eaten anything for breakfast other than your standard US Egg/Diner food. Metro is in a class all its own. I seriously had the best breakfast I have ever had in AZ.  The service was friendly & professional. Also, very helpful & knowledgeable AND PATIENT while describing the French items. At our table we had eggs benedict, THE BEST eggs benedict I have ever had (not like the quail egg on a cruoton you get at T. Cooks) beyond delicious salmon crepes,and the egg white omelette was even good for  being healthy.  I cant wait to go back bc I've heard (and now seen) the famous tempura bacon. If you need a good breakfast, skip all the rest & come to the best. You won't be disappointed!! This IS the ONLY spot for breakfast. Not to mention an entire "hangover cure" cocktail menu. GENIUS!!!!!~~#~1
It sucks that my liquor cabinet has a huge selection of booze but they're all only about a quarter inch full.  Now enter Total Wine and More.I get weak in the knees when I come in here.  I just want it all.  I LOVE the fact that they always have wine tasting going on when I come in and I can be counted on to buy a bottle of whatever they are serving up, gotta support the cause.  One of my favorite places to shop!~~#~1
New info from AJs, they have reconsidered and plans to close this store are currently on hold.*************************************************************AJ's will be closing this location at the end of March 2008.The currently are planning to replace AJ's with a Sportsman's as they bought the name several months ago.~~#~1
Still the best!~~#~1
I have actually never been inside this place because of my newborn son I am the drive thu queen (lugging a carseat in and out is a pain in the summer and always wakes the sleeping little guy), but I love the coffee and tea here! Beats Starbucks hands down in fresh taste. I wish I lived closer to his location but always drive out of my way for a treat here~~#~1
This has become my go to restaurant for burgers. It all started with just wanting a cheap burger alternative to fast food. Mondays their burgers are $5.55. Great! Little did I know it would become my favorite burger ever! I'm referring to the Switch house burger. Ordered medium rare it come out a perfect pink inside and super juicy. Only once has it not come out as ordered and they were happy to take care of it for me. I have had other dishes there that were very good. They have food and drink specials every day. Very reasonable prices and excellent service.~~#~1
In the very great and wise words of my father "Holy Crap That's Good!". There is no wiser sentence that can describe how amazing this place is! One of my dear friends took me to this place that he knew about. It apparently is the "IT" place to go in Vegas. I had my doubts. We drove up to the place and it looked a little dumpy (apparently this is a sign of a great place to eat). There wasn't much on the wall except for a menu with about 30 different subs. I allowed my friend to order for me since it seemed like he knew what the best thing to get was. He ordered a turkey sub on wheat with slaw and extra Russian. The kids behind the counter couldn't have been much older then 17 and reminded me of every single person in my graduating class. Helpful and pleasant enough to not get fired. When they were done making my sandwich I swear it was the biggest "medium" sub I had ever seen. When I took my first bite it was to die for! It was not a sandwich for the dainty. The sandwich got all over the place and was the best sandwich I had ever eaten! I had never eaten a sandwich with Cole slaw on it, but it is something to be tried. I declare that everyone needs to eat here!~~#~1
If I could I would give Spinato's 10 stars! We love this place...basically we are addicted. I am in love with the Nicole's new favorite . The flavors are perfectly infused. The thing is the food is just the half of it. The service is amazing...it makes the dining experience perfect. We have been there about 6 times over the past 4 months and not once have had bad service. Everyone is so friendly. Tonight we had a new waitress we had never had before. She suggested a wine that I fell in love with. Also the waiter we had the last time we were there stopped by said hi and made sure we were being taken care of. They really are great at what they do, Other restaurants need to take tips from them.The food is so good you want to run in the kitchen and yell "you guys are awesome."~~#~1
So, mother always said if you can't say something nice don't say anything at all. When I finally reached someone at Ladlow's after two unanswered voice messages and an email about a bench ordered in September they were quick to refund my deposit after we determined the bench wasn't on order. They blamed it on the manufacturer and slow demand for the piece but the manufacturer said in an email to me they were surprised at that response and couldn't find an order from Ladlow's for the item. I was glad they sent the refund check so quickly. That's as nice as I can be.~~#~0
Great local gem !~~#~1
I was in a pinch and my taxes were late, I was also juggling some issues with my small business and just moved to the Scottsdale area. I called Thomas' office and I'm happy I did. He was quick to answer questions and his prices are fair. He was able to clear up my tax issues within 2 days!  I would definitely recommend him.~~#~1
Do not trust this dealer. Originally I agreed to a $500 deposit on the vehicle I was interested in. When I found out that the dealer was building-in a bunch of extra costs in to the MSRP, I found a better deal. When I told Johnny Medrano that our deal was off, he tied-up $1000 in my account. Zero class, zero professionalism, not to be trusted.~~#~0
When It Comes To Chili's, I'll Never Get Cold FeetI usually visit the Chili's on Camelback in Phoenix, AZ. I always find something delicious to order and my dining experience is always great. I like the fact that I can eat a great meal at Chli's and still pay an affordable price. Chili's staff is knowledgeable about menu choices and often make helpful suggestions about specific menu items. I also must comment on the relaxed atmosphere and cleanliness of this restaurant. Overall, a five-star restaurant at a one-star price. The coupons also help and encourage me to try out new items that I would not ordinarily order. Thanks to all at Chili's for keeping my palate alive and well, and for providing a truly gastronomically delightful experience.~~#~1
Fantastic breakfast place.  Always worth the wait.  Found the place from Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives show.  I'm a big fan of breakfast, but I also know what a great breakfast tastes like.  This is it.  Don't be discouraged by the wait time or the close quarters.  Belly up to the counter if you're claustrophobic.   Everything I've eaten off of the menu has been stellar.  Some reviewers said orange juice was small, but it's fresh-squeezed and delicious (unless you just brushed your teeth).  Hog and Chick, Griddle Cakes, Waffle and Bacon, all phenomenal.  Service is always excellent here.  Sometimes there were three different people waiting on our party, but we never lacked for a thing.  Give it a shot!~~#~1
Forgettaboutit!  Reminds me of home in NYC!  Awesome pizza and Matt is the best!  Why would you go anywhere else to have pizza in Scottsdale?~~#~1
Owner pridefully runs this wonderful establishment!  Fresh food, made to order in no time flat!A+ in my book, they even offer student discounts!If there is something not up to par just ask and they will fix it, (although I have NEVER had to.~~#~1
The Boyfriend and I went last night - an attempt to do something different - and man was it FUN!It's $16/person for the day pass and all the gear you need. As first timers, we had to watch an orientation video (no longer than 10 min) then a very informative and friendly staff member took us step by step through the basics of belaying, climbing, etc etc till we felt comfortable with it. After that, it was totally free for all!!The entire place is just wall after wall of man made rocks with random ropes every few feet. They have preset paths with numbers to designate how difficult that climb is (the higher the number, the harder the climb) but they also have an area without any numbers and plenty of rocks for n00bs like me. But for non-n00bs, they even have a belay-free zone where you can climb independently.Seriously, it was a TON of fun! The Boyfriend and I took turns climbing and belaying for a little over an hour until we decided our bodies couldn't take it anymore. Don't be fooled - this shit is TOUGH! I'm anticipating soreness in my arms and legs soon...Some tips for when you go:- Bring water! You sweat and get outta breathe, so something to quench your thirst is good. This place doesn't have AC, just s few big fans.- Go in pairs, unless you don't mind sitting out every other climb.- If you're scared of heights, this is a great place to face it.- Don't wear short-shorts. I made that mistake and paid for it with an hour long wedgie from the harness.~~#~1
Voonderbar!!! Never knew this was here! Was brought here by a friend who loves this place so i thought I'd try it out! NICE! Goodness and cheap!!!~~#~1
This place is the worst for loans. It took four times for them to get my auto loan correct. Of course its always someone elses fault too, I never really got a straight answer as to why I had to come back 4 times to close the loan... Its enough for me to switch banks & I've banked w/ them for ten years.~~#~0
The Parlor, I loved it in so many ways because they take care of you on all levels, food, service & it's a nice spot to hang with your friends. Thanks Yelp, I would not have known of this place if it was not for you & my fellow Yelpers. Yep, as good as it gets for sure.~~#~1
The best fish tacos I have ever had and maybe the best fish tacos in the world.  I think the tacos were $1.50 each.  How is that possible?!  My wife loved her chicken tamale, comparing it to the world-renowned tamales made by a family friend.  The guy running this place is really nice and helpful.  My highest possible recommendation.  A+~~#~1
The last time we went to this Claim Jumper, we were interrupted during an intimate conversation by the server, who went into an annoying and lengthy sales pitch about CJ gift cards. Who wants to have to sit through that while trying to have a nice quiet meal?We overlooked that today and went back, and guess what? The server balked when I ordered fish tacos and asked for the seasoned fries as one of the choices for side. She told us that even though the tacos are listed on the menu under the Sandwiches category, which lists several choices of side dishes that automatically come with the order, the fish tacos aren't included in that option. What? There is NO disclaimer on the menu that says "...except for the fish tacos." Then when I insisted (because the menu specifically SAYS side dishes come with the items on the list, DUH!) she pointed out that rice pilaf comes with the tacos, so would I like to omit the pilaf in favor of the fries? What is she, the Carbohydrate Police? No, I would not like to substitute fries for the pilaf. I want both of them just like the menu indicates. I like both rice and fries, thankyouverymuch. Then she said she'd send the manager over to talk to me. Fine, send him. He arrived, squatted down next to our booth, and proceeded to examine the menu for errors. Nope. The menu is clearly misleading, and I was clearly entitled to the fries with my tacos if I so desired. He left and twenty minutes later our meal was served. Strike number three, the corn tortillas on the fish tacos were so tough that my husband could only eat one of his tacos and I had to discard the tortillas and eat the fish filling with a fork. We brought home leftovers for the dog and cats, meanwhile vowing to NEVER EVER go back to Claim Jumper again. Why go to Claim Jumper anyway, when you can just go to the freezer section of your local supermarket and buy CJ products, and save both money and aggravation?~~#~0
Miguel Flores is a decent sincere businessman who cares about his customers.  Anyone who does not consider him for their ac needs is making a significant mistake.~~#~1
My first visit to this spot - I was excited to try it!  Went with a friend and did a little sampling of things. Based on the previous reviews we split the Hana Dog. It did not disappoint! I was worried that the cheese would be melted/greasy/overwhelming but was pleasantly surprised that it was just a little sprinkling of fresh grated cheese. The avocado, cilantro, bacon and mango in the pico was a great combo and the bun was so good - they could sell those alone as rolls! Also tried a "maui style" beef slider and a "maui style" spam slider. Maui style meaning garlic mayo and coleslaw - really good. The atmosphere was friendly and by noon the place was packed. The owner was there and made a point to talk to us. The only thing I wasn't sold on was the fries - but I'm sure they'll get that figured out in time. Definitely will try this place again!~~#~1
Mama Spinato's Signature Fresh Spinach Pizza is one of the most perfect meals you can find in the Valley.Spinato's sauce is really what hits the spot. It's slightly sweet. The fresh garlic on this pizza catches you by surprise and keeps you coming back for more.If I could give Spinato's an extra star, I would. And it would be for the following: If you eat in the restaurant, the pizzas are served on top of a cooling rack, on top of a pizza pan. This ensures proper air circulation to the crust. By the time you get to that last slice of pizza (and trust me, there will be no leftovers to speak of) the crust still holds up to the pile of fresh spinach which sits atop it!I know it's in a seemingly bland industrial park, but I promise you that there is nothing bland about the food. This will be a family favorite for as long as it exists.~~#~1
We went to the "Date Night" Sunday Afternoon - the movie was great.  The experience was also great - the theater is clean and.  customer service was excellent. I left my purse and when I called they were very polite told me it was found right after the movie locked away for me to retrieve.  They also called me this morning to confirm I knew they had it and letting me know I could pick it up. Much Appreciated!~~#~1
I would have to say this place is my favorite bar in all of the Phoenix area. The Tempe land mark which is situated in a cool old neighborhood, offers everything from Oysters to their famous strong pours. Be careful though, I recommend taking a cab or the light rail to this destination (no joke). Ask for Jimmy and you will see what I mean.~~#~1
I love this place! Music is great and the artists all provide endless hours of entertainment and fun.~~#~1
OMG, you must be kidding and this place is in business?? so i have heard of Big Matts and wanted to try it. This afternoon i went their for the first time and what a JOKE. first of all i arrived at 12:15 PM and the front door was locked. I asked couple of men that were standing outside how to you get in this place and they told me from the front door, which i was standing in front of. So i knocked on the door and the server opened the door. My first thought is to the owner, dont be cheap and just go ahead and get a real lock for the front door. Then I asked servers where the bathroom was? she told me they dont have one, however they share one with the hotel next door. (this is not a Hilton by the way). I asked i just want to wash my hands. She told me they had hand sanitizer up front. so i used it . I understand the place is small, however, there is health requirement and I am not sure how they pass this. I believe the employees would wash their hands more then once a day. CAUTION!!!! HEALTH. Food. the server was nice and took my order. I asked for their best item on the menu and she highly recommended the daily special. Okay that is what i will get. I got two scrambled eggs, fresh motezzerla, sausage (disgusting) and sweet peppers, this was served with home potato's and toast. how bad can the eggs be, the sausage was uneatable, the potato's were full of Rosemary, and ONE slice of toast for $ 8.95. I have been to numerous breakfast restaurant  and never remember being served ONE slice of toast. Please dont be cheap for $ 8.95 you can serve two slice of toast. I am not sure what the hype is about this place, i will never go there. if you want breakfast go somewhere else like "the breakfast club".~~#~0
What's the sign of a fabulous restaurant? I simply cannot get this deelish memory out of my head -- and it's been weeks since I've eaten there. My restaurant habits tend to be that of repetition and fear of trying somewhere new. Having been a vegetarian for over a decade, new menus were more an exercise in fear than a potential find.So a few weeks ago when I was feeling adventurous, I loaded the kid and the boy in the car and asked who wanted where and what to eat. The regular short list of restaurants offered nothing in the way of interest for any of us, and, desperate, I pulled out the Sidekick 3 to get some ideas. Ryan said he wanted a burger, so I searched for "best burger near [my zip code]" and a reference to Delux Burger popped up. It was relatively close to home, so off we went.Arriving, the outside of the restaurant is a little deceptive. It's in a Safeway shopping center and if you're not looking for Delux, you're likely to miss it altogether. It's a tiny little place with a tiny little patio but (by virtue of being nestled in a shopping center) there's plenty of parking.Moms & Dads: I was a little nervous that an exclusive little diner like this would be the type to be unfriendly to kids, but that's definitely not an issue. Space is scant, but we sat on the patio and it was comfortable.The menus were skinny and long and consisted mostly of the beer, wine, and liquor selection, which might have been their original focus from the start (but I don't know that for sure). Their hours are 11am-2am, so I think they're really hoping to serve a post-club-but-not-done-partying segment in the wee-er hours. I perused to find something other than beef or chicken (I don't eat either) and was thrilled to find a grown-up grilled cheese (3 cheese, oven-roasted tomatoes, baby arugula on a demi-baguette).Shortly thereafter, I saw it. The delux Fresh Fish sandwich. The idea of a grilled cheese was interesting given the ingredients, but I wanted something less rich and more flavorful, and here it was, offered up to me in a single menu entry like a hand-picked wildflower from a wide-grinned, grateful, not-expecting-anything-in-return toddler...From the menu:    Grilled Mahi Mahi marinated in sake and orange juice with wild herbs, served on a toasted, handcrafted brioche bun with redleaf lettuce, all-natural beefsteak tomatoes and red onions accompanied by sides of creme tartar and cucumber-pear medley.One word describes this sandwich: Divine. It was hot and perfectly cooked. The fish was light and the flavors were magical. The bread wasn't overpowering and the lettuce was proportioned -just enough- to give you a taste and a different texture, but not take the spotlight from what the real star was. I couldn't get enough of this sandwich. Sadly, though, it came to an end much quicker than I'd desired and yet I was still craving more. How often does something so good and good for you leave you so breathless and wanting more?We had also ordered a "shopping cart" of sweet potato and regular french fries (the kid loved that, though toddlers + things on wheels atop on high surfaces are surely a recipe for eventual disaster), and I snacked on those to curb any further temptation to order another sandwich. At $10 a pop, I didn't need to scarf these things like snacks.The kid had a kids-friendly grilled cheese which was a panini-based creation (very simple) on a bed of french fries, though she didn't want anything to do with those fries when the shopping cart fries were also available and, by virtue of their container, much more tasty! Ryan had a burger and he liked it, too, but I honestly remember very little of our outing as I was too busy flying high on my mahi mahi experience.Time kinda stood still for a little while and for that I must recommend Delux Burger to anyone who likes to eat stuff that tastes really good.~~#~1
If your ancestry is from one of those weird countries whose name ends in 'IA', like Bulgaria, Algeria, Bosnia, Romania....You're genetically predisposed to liking cabbage rolls.I'm not, but I love cabbage rolls just the same.This place is where you go for great cabbage rolls.One usually does me in due to the size, but if you're Bulgarian or something, you'll probably want the entire chaffing dish. (I think those 'IA' people are a fairly large breed)The sauce, slightly sweet, the meat filling features raisins for added flavor.They're a little pricey, but hey, where are you going to get cabbage rolls? If you like cabbage, and you're hoping to get even with your satanic co-worker tomorrow with a memorable,  grey-matter destroying case of the farts you got from overdoing it on the cabbage, I can't think of a better recipe. Don't deny your heritage...you're a fart-factory by nature. Feed the beast, I say. Come here and be the 'IAN'  you always knew you could.Note: A side of cole slaw and cleaning up your wife's reuben also helps in this endeavor.~~#~1
I don't understand why peeps like this.  I just think it's sooooooo weird.  i like the concept and i like that they give you tastings.  but overall, the food is meh AND it's kinda cold and lacks atmosphere.  but i guess it would be a haven for vegetarians and people who like soy.~~#~0
Great fresh sauce and spicy pepperoni.  Mozzarella tasted handmade and crust had the right thickness.  Good pie.~~#~1
This manager is a chauvinist pig, he has fired me because he has gotten a complaint on himself, he has made sexual comments to almost everyone that works there and is a very rude person. I would not take any one that I care about to this restaurant!!!~~#~0
Beautiful campus with great academic programs and a professional student body, my home for the past year :)~~#~1
I brought my sister and her friend who were in town for pedicures and eyebrow waxes. Also for my niece and her friend to get their nails for the Justin bieber concert. Well, I feel horrible for taking them here.  Lynn has been doing my eyebrows for a while now. Even when she was at a different location. She HURT my sister and her friend. Almost 24 hours later and they are still in pain. She was extremely rude and very unprofessional. She had just finished eating and was smacking whatever food was left in her mouth the entire time. You could also hear her food digesting inner stomach which made the experience even more uncomfortable. Now to the little girls.   Unfortunately we don't all speak the same language, but that is no excuse to be blatantly rude and making fun of two little girls who are excited about a concert. The women painting their nails were CLEARLY making fun of them and the girls felt soooooo uncomfortable.  I will NEVER be back nor will I refer anyone.   There are plenty of nail salons and this one has lost my business and that of everyone I know.~~#~0
My dog has had chronic ear infections for over 10 years which is very common for her breed (Cocker Spaniel mix).  Despite trying many different oral and topical medications, I was unable to find a vet that was able to cure her until I met Dr. Dawson.Dr. Dawson put her on several medications and also put her on a hyper-allergenic dog food to test her for allergies.  Within 2 weeks, my dog was cured!  She has more energy than she has in years and no longer scratches her ears constantly.  It's as though I have a new dog.  I couldn't be happier to have found Dr. Dawson!~~#~1
Love this place! Amazing wood fired pizza at an affordable price. We've eaten in the restaurant 4-times and have always had great service. We also order out and they wait for you to get there to fire up the pizzas. It's a must try!!~~#~1
Best Thai we've ever had! As a resident of Scottsdale and walking distance from the bistro, we have taken all of our out of town guests to have their wonderful thai and experience their fabulous atmosphere. The Pad Thai and crispy pesto ginger chicken is amazing! The service is wonderful. On Monday nights, they have live music. If you would like to be near the music, I would encourage a reservation. Definitely worth a visit!~~#~1
This is the best sushi in town! If you come during happy hour (lunch and between 5 and 7) you can get a roll with 8 pieces, edamame, miso, a mini salad, and ice cream for $2.25! On their California Rolls, they put a generous amount of crab.~~#~1
Married or dating a Comic Book Nerd?  Here is the perfect place to purchase a gift certificate for that special person in your life.  The staff is always so nice here.  I only go when I need to purchase a GC for the hub, it's even bagged and boarded! The parking is a bit tricky, be careful when trying to leave.... you have to semi reverse onto Central if you don't plan accordingly.~~#~1
The salsa...can I ever say enough good things about the salsa?  I could eat it with a spoon but instead I much on their thin, crispy chips that compliment the salsa perfectly.  Their sangria is delicious and my hubby and I split a carafe every time we go there.  My only complaint is that you can't get the happy hour price if you are eating at the restaurant - which is just 5 feet away.We love their enchiladas and there is a fish dish (whose name escapes me right now) that is amazing.Service is always friendly and excellent.  By far, one of our favorite restaurants!~~#~1
Why would anyone pay money for food like this?~~#~0
If you have the money to eat here DO IT! The food amazing and the atmosphere makes you feel like a million bucks (or 6) hehe. We were seated by the pool for dinner and it was perfect. The service was great and our waiter explained items on the menu very well. Drinks were ordered to celebrate our anniversary. Chris(my bf) got a Coor's light and I got drink that tasted like a cucumber mojito and it was very strong. Our waiter dropped off a bread basket filled with sourdough rolls and onion focaccia. I promised myself I wouldn't fill up on bread but it was hard not to break that promise. For dinner we ordered a caesar salad, steak, and shared the lobster gnocchi. Best meal ever!My only complaint is that they didn't do anything special even though I told the receptionist that we would be celebrating our anniversary. I loved every minute of my dinner here so it's really not a complaint I was just surprised they didn't at least offer dessert. It won't prevent me from coming back. I'm glad I chose Dominick's to celebrate our anniversary. I'll be back soon!~~#~1
Fresh ingredients, good service, wonderful favors. Simple concept that works. Wife had phenomenal turkey sandwich' I had great French toast friends had roast beef sandwich and an appetizer cheese plate with something else that I missed.  If you are a person that likes a huge stack of pancakes, with four eggs and bunch of bacon as a minimum for breakfast this is wrong for you.  The portions are modest but filling for me.  This is about the taste not the poundage.We went for brunch and my screwdriver had fresh squeezed OJ    The Bloody Mary's  Were great   Oh and split an order of fries.  Not a lot of tables but lots of space at bar.  And it is expensive.  But there are other expensive breakfast spots in the area that have disappointed me.  This one doesn't disappoint.  Best thing about our brunch was no adults brought their awful  obnoxious horrible children  So nice to have quiet adults.  I have children in their 20s. I never took them anywhere before they could behave.  I can't wait for my grandchildren to b  here. But they will be polite before they go to a restaurant.  This has nothing to do with cafe bink.  Everything to do with civility   Your child or grandchild is hideous.  Leave them at home when they visit from Minnesota   They suck. Seriously. Everyone hated them on the flight also.  And your wife /daughter whatever is fat and making excuses for not parenting~~#~1
This guys make the best oatmeal cookies and scones in the valley! Very friendly people and everything tastes like home made.~~#~1
I never give places 5 stars, but this place is worth it!!  I always get a slice of cheese pizza.  It is the cheesiest more delicious pizza I've had. I love this place, I just wish there hours were longer and that they were open on Sundays.~~#~1
So a group of us decided to get brunch here this am and boy am I glad I did. I started with a super killer spicy bloody Mary that came with a little beer chaser...awesome. I got the green Chile meat loaf with fried eggs. I can easily say this was among  the best meat loaf I've ever had .the texture was perfect, flavor deep and rich and it worked sooooo well with my over easy eggs. I can't wait to gio back and try some of the other stuff on the menu....awesome!!!!~~#~1
On Sunday I had the best breakfast ever.  Not the kind of breakfast you eat on the go before work - more like the breakfast you eat after hiking Camelback or running 6 miles.Carne adovada with eggs, beans, potatoes, cheese, and tortillas.  Red chile sauce.  The room smelled like a campfire.   So so good.I would also like to take this oppurtunity to thank the idiot legislators who passed the law whereby I cannot order a Bloody Mary before 10am on Sunday while enjoying the best breakfast ever at Dick's Hideway.  Why Sunday?  Some drunk can order one before work Mon - Fri, but I can't on my day off?  Well, at least I can still take my handgun with me....Thank you for listening.~~#~1
Thursday they have free Texas Hold'em with great prizes for the top 3 players, the smallest of which is a bottle of booze to take home with you.  From Parrot Bay to Patron XO so far...  If you see me there and mention yelp... I'll buy you your first round! :)Friday and Saturday it is back to being a swanky club.  Heidi, Andy and Anton are three bartenders that make me want to keep coming in with their great service and attitudes.The room itself is rather simple, just a large box with two bars on either extreme.  What sets this club apart from the rest of the oldtown clubs is that people seem very approachable.  Whether saying hi to a stranger at the bar, or chit chatting outside on the smoking couches (where unfortunately we can not drink!!) people seem receptive to new faces.~~#~1
Hands down the best sushi in Phoenix. Hiro's culinary skills are unmatched - he is easily my favorite chef in Arizona.~~#~1
Worst massage EVER! They were 5 minutes late and had me leave 5 minutes early(Sounds like less than an hour). Then I asked for a deep tissue massage and they gave me a little dainty chick that couldn't squash a grape in a fruit fight! And then when it's all done you get to head back to the lobby and get the biggest sales pitch of your life. NEWS FLASH... You can get $40 massage's all day on groupon. There are better places you just have to look.~~#~0
http://bedbugregistry.com/hotel/AZ/Fort-Mcdowell/Radisson%25252DFort-McDowell/I stayed July 14, 2012 and received 20 bites on my arms and face, that were instantly infected and the knuckle on my right hand was bit so much in one place that my finger swelled up extremely much and turned purple. The bites on my arms were more like large blisters that burned not itch. The burning was unbearable and very painful for days. I went to a couple pharmacy's to ask what kind of bites and they were all shocked at how instantly infected and serious they were, one pharmacist advised me to seek a doctor immediately stating I could suffer permanent hand damage since being bit so much on the joint knuckle. Luckily the urgent care i went to in Scottsdale, the doctor had seen a lot of bed bug bites and stated that is what they were. And yes they were all infected. I was shocked at how serious the bites appeared so quickly infected. He prescribed me 2 prescriptions, very strong, saying that if I didnt see improvement in 24 hrs to go immediately to a dermatologist to get stronger treatment.  I didnt see improvement until about 4 days later. The doctor also advised me to stay aware of my breathing in case I went into amphylactic shock.  I was horrified. The Mgr Bert Parra wrote me a letter stating they would not pay 120.00 for my doctor bills. Unbelievable. I contacted all of the television stations by website application since bed bugs are such a hot topic now in Az and I also filed a lawsuit in Fort McDowell Tribal Court. I would advise being very careful about staying in this hotel as they will obviously not take responsibility or help you. If you also stayed here and got bites, feel free to contact me. Its been 2 weeks, the bites did get about 50 percent better but it is a very painful and horrifying experience and the bites are not gone yet. I have scars from them as well on the few that have miminized. Im hoping they go away but It will be another few weeks before they are gone completely. Clicking on the above site, you will see other similiar reports at this hotel. Please add yours if you experienced bites there, it is not right that they do nothing to protect or assist the guests. I did contact the Radisson corp office who knew about the bed bug problem and I called Carla who stated "she would look into a resolution for me" but I called her back 3 times to which Carla advised me she had been busy in mtgs, went on vacation, and she never has returned my call with any resolution...I am shocked to see Carla had time to respond here though....well Carla, its been 2 months and Im still waiting for my resolution and I posted a photo of the worst bite where i almost suffered permanent damage and loss of my hand movement....People! Do not take bed bug bites lightly, they are extremely dangerous. Seek immediate medical assistance.~~#~0
So... we were unable to use the laundry machines at our apartment complex for a month, and aside from doing some desperation laundry loads at our friend's place, we had a large laundry pile of impending doom.  Unsure of when the laundry room problem would actually be fixed, we bit the bullet and headed over to Eco Laundry to wash, wash, wash, and dry, dry, dry those massive piles of laundry!  We were immediately greeted by the cheerful associate, who encouraged us to ask him for help if we needed anything.  They have change machines, and vending machines with snacks, drinks, and laundry supplies if you've forgotten or run out of a few items.  The machines were clean, as were the floors, and there were many different washers to fit your load needs (1, 3, 5, and 6 load washers).  We went here on a busier night, but had no problem with getting the type of machines we needed, or getting a dryer.  They also have carts for you to place your laundry when transporting it to the dryers.  I was impressed by the associate here.  I don't know his name, but he was a young gentleman with a thick (Scottish?) accent, but I commend him for his devotion to work!  He was constantly moving from area to area, cleaning the floors, and cleaning the inside of the machines to make sure everything was spotless.They finally fixed the laundry room problem where we live, but if we ever need to go to a laundromat again, this is the place to go!~~#~1
The absolute best fried chicken I've ever had. The waffles and syrup are heaven on a plate, with a hint of cinnamon.Lo-Lo's is a required stop after an overnight visit to Phoenix. My fiance and I wake up, check out of our hotel in a hurry, ignoring any and all continental breakfasts that stand in our way. We never remember where Lo-Lo's is exactly, except that it's on some side street, but fortunately GPS has never let us down.Lo-Lo's makes a point of hanging signs that indicate that service is slow, but I've never had a bad experience there.Mmm mmm mmm!~~#~1
Everyone goes to the Lee Lee market!This is the largest and best stocked supermarket in the valley, and, it just happens to be an asian market. They have aisles dedicated to different regions of the world, and, an amazing fresh produce department, live fish counter, meat market and dry goods section. If you are looking for foods from India, Pakistan, Japan, Egypt, Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines, Turkey, the Caribbean, Spain, China, and a lot more, this is your best destination in the Valley of the Sun!~~#~1
Came up to Hooters to catch the UFC fight.  There was a 45 minute wait for a table due to the fight night.  Luckily my buddy found a group on a large bench on the patio that was only using half of it and was cool with us sitting on the other side.Typical UFC fight crowd.  Youger guys in their 20s with lots of black attire with white lettering.  I couldn't believe there was a family in the middle of the patio.  Early 20 year old couple and about 4 kids ranging from 1-6 years old.  Right smack in the middle of people getting drunk and smoking on the patio at Hooters...no lie.  Absolutely rediculous.We had probably one of the dumbest waitress of all time.  My boy ordered a Michelob Ultra (weak and embarassing as that is) and she was trying to spell and sound it out at the same time then looks up and asks "what is that...a...beer?"  True story.  I ordered 20 wings with blue cheese and ranch, half a dozen oysters, and my other buddy ordered a chicken quesadilla.  45 minutes to an hour later she brings out the wings with no dressing.  Had to flag her down to bring the dressing.  Still no quesadilla, still no drink refills.  Finally the quesadilla comes after all the wings are long gone.  I understand its a busy fight night but its still hooters.  Quesadillas and wings should be practically on standby.  The waitress would disappear for so long we just couldnt take it anymore and left before the fights were even getting to the good cards.Service absolutely sucked, wings were below mediocre and I dropped 50 bucks on wings, oysters, and 2 beers.  No thanks.  Hope I never come back here and definitely not on a fight night.~~#~0
We ALWAYS have a great time here!  The staff is very friendly, the place is casual but lively, and the music on the weekends has never disappointed.~~#~1
It's not often that I would give a resort restaurant a good review.  Probably because we usually stray from them because they are often a billion dollars by the time you leave the place.We decided upon dinner here while staying at the Biltmore for the Hell City Convention.  Since we live in town, I know the area pretty well so our options were anything in the Biltmore area or Frank & Alberts.  I had passed by the menu earlier and figured we'd try it.We showed up about 6-7ish for dinner and there was no wait, but plenty of people inside.   We were nicely sat right next to the kitchen and almost instantly our drink orders were taken by the smiling Elizabeth. After our drinks we ordered our food and within 20min, our food was out.While waiting for our food they gave us some bread and a couple dips that were delicious.  One was a chipotle ketchup and the other was a green olive aole type drip.  Both great.  We ordered some onion rings that came stacked in a nice formation along with some buttermilk ranch.  We all ate a few of those, but had saved more for later.it was dinner time..  One of our friends had eaten so he grabbed a dessert that he said was one of the best he's ever eaten.  My girlfriend and I ordered the prime rib.  For $25, I thought this was a great price for such a fancy establishment.   I haven't had this tasty of a prime rib cut in a long time.  Every bite was better than the next.  Along with that was a huge piece of broccoli and a nicely cooked baked potato.  The meal was amazing.But the meal was just a part of it..  Our server Elizabeth would always drop by to make sure we had what we needed.  They were so on top of things, if they over heard us comment on something, they would rush over to make sure we had it.  The staff was ridiculously nice and even the chef came out to check on our food.  I don't think I've ever had a better experience at a restaurant like  I did here.   Frank & Alberts knows food and knows how to take care of their customers.  Well done.We loved this place so much that we werent here three times during our stay this past weekend.~~#~1
I love my new glasses!!! I can't remember the last time I have been excited about glasses! For years I have been going to places like Lens Crafters and never ventured out of the box. The same old stuff. Was in need of new glasses, and have been wanting to try Sassy Glasses for some time now. Went in on a nice Saturday and I was immediately blown away with the frames. Wow! They had designers I have never heard of, cool stuff from Japan and Europe. No Ray Bans or Polo Ralph Lauren same old blah blah here. The owner a very nice man named Dan who had the coolest pair of glasses on, he told me that he personally has about 20 pairs himself!! I looked at about 10 pairs and honestly if I could have afforded it I would have gotten all of them! Yikes, the selection blew me away. They also have new technology called digital progressives (if you need them), which was described as the HD of progressive wear. I finally decided on a titanium awesome hip pair by a company called Pro-Design from Denmark. http://www.pd-eyewear.com/ Dan really took his time with me, he didn't give me a hard time about my prescription like the Lens Crafters place (the manager kept saying, you really have an astigmatism, like 3 times which really brought me down), and if you have to wear glasses you will be like a kid in a candy store here. If you need glasses, you HAVE to go here! Trust me on this. Sure I paid a couple hundred more than the usual places, but I am finally happy with my glasses! They gave me a cool coffee mug and $20 off too. Rumor has it (per Santa), if I am good, I can have another pair for Xmas!!Addendum: they do not do eye exams here, so just bring in your most recent script.~~#~1
You've got to hand it to Candace Nelson; she knows how to bake up palpable buzz.  You need look no further than the perpetual line at Sprinkles Cupcakes in Scottsdale.  If only the cupcakes were as good as the hype.  Unfortunately, they are not.It comes down to style over substance.  Sprinkles Cupcakes has a great look from the windows frosted with the outlines of cupcake wrappers to the spare wood display racks.  The aesthetic is clean, modern and restrained.   The cupcakes are impeccable in terms of their appearance.  The bakery even offers an interlocking cardboard stand with optional ribbon trim to create a display for a special event.  The graphics and design are top-notch.  While we may eat with our eyes first, the disappointment creeps in once you move beyond the visual and taste the cupcakes.  At best, they're okay.  In order to give Sprinkles a fair shake, I pre-ordered a dozen online.  Anyone can order a minimum of a dozen cupcakes online with 24 hours advance notice.  The real advantage of the pre-order is that you get to skip the mayhem of the line.  It's worth it to walk right up to the counter and pick up your prepaid order without having to stand in the chaotic line and watch the crowd's tension level rise as they run out of flavor after flavor.  As a home baker who makes everything from scratch, I found Sprinkles Cupcakes to be resoundingly underwhelming.  Their signature Red Velvet Cake was a real disappointment.  The cake itself was bitter and sour at the same time.  It also had an unpleasant lingering aftertaste.  Actually, all of the cupcakes I tried with chocolate cake had the same bitter and sour taste combined with the lingering unpleasant aftertaste.  It was almost like the chocolate cakes weren't mixed properly before they were baked.  If it has been one or two cupcakes, I would have given them the benefit of the doubt; however, this place takes the concept of bittersweet chocolate to a new and very strange level.  The Carrot cupcake is also misnamed; it should be called a Spice cupcake instead because the presence of any carrot is nearly undetectable.  In fairness, the Coconut cupcake was the best of the 12 sampled.  The taste of both the cake and the icing was great; the cake itself was a bit stiff and dry (but less than the others sampled).  In terms of texture, the 12 cupcakes sampled varied from "sturdy" (e.g., nothing close to tender) to dry and crumbling apart.  This is definitely not what I expect from a premium bakery.  Some other reviewers have commented that the cupcakes are too expensive.  Clearly they haven't been to a grocery store lately to check on the price of butter, eggs, sugar, cream, cream cheese, etc.  The cupcakes are fairly priced for the premium ingredients that Sprinkles uses.  However, those ingredients are not falling into the most adept hands.  Perhaps this is an issue with a newly trained staff.  For the money and the pleasure of the experience, enjoy an Ooey Gooey from Tammie Coe instead of Sprinkles.  Tammie's cupcakes are the real deal and are everything that Sprinkles aspires to be.  Just be sure to allow Tammie's cupcakes to return to room temperature before you devour them.  They're sublime while the cupcakes at Sprinkles are serviceable at best.Sprinkles Cupcakes was worth trying once to see what all the hype was about.  However, I won't be back.~~#~0
Just opened in Desert Ridge and there is also a location near the Biltmore - this soup/salad/sandwich lunch spot hits the spot!The Try 2 is a great way to have a sandwich/soup soup/salad salad/sandwich combo for 7.99.  The sandwiches and salads are good but the soups are out of this world.  Drinks are also excellent - yes its a fountain server a la any other sandwich place, but Zupas has Italian Soda syrups nearby that you can pump into your drink, turning a coke into a Strawberry Cola, or a Ginger Ale (I have not seen this on soda fountain before) into a Raspberry Ginger Ale.Kids giving you trouble?  Got an iPod handy?  No problem - they even have docks and screens for the little ones to watch their favorite movies while you eat in piece.All in all a great place for lunch.Fair warning to weekend lunchers - this place is closed Sundays~~#~1
I find myself in this neighborhood more frequently when I'm coming to visit my childhood friends. They still live in the same house they did forty years ago, when we were just bratty little kids terrorizing the block on our Big Wheels. So what a treat to find that The Main Ingredient was opening up just a hop and a skip away from my old stomping grounds!The word "alehouse" caught my eye originally, as I tend to be a sucker for any place that has a decent beer selection. I became a fan of this place on Facebook so I would be informed when they were ready for business. When I finally made it here, about a week after they opened, I was not disappointed. Ordered a nut-brown ale and some green chili mac 'n cheese. Also tried the artichoke spinach dip which was arguably the tastiest I've ever had. The mac n' cheese was creamy and comforting and the green chili subtle, but I wish it had more of a salty sharp cheesy bite to it. Also sampled a forkful of the Winner salad and it was indeed a winner.So I will return again to reminisce with childhood friends over a pint or three. And I won't hesitate to try the rest of the menu as the food here is obviously high caliber. I didn't ask about the origin of the name of the restaurant, but in my opinion, the main ingredient served here is love. Can you feel the love?~~#~1
Great place to go on a Sunday/Saturday for some good breakfast.~~#~1
I have the same problem as customer above. Working with I forgot her name who is giving us a run around and I called her and told her I wasn't happy about our service and I have read bad reviews and I will be writing one too and she became rude. I would not buy from this place.~~#~0
First of all, if you are a bride who needs a dress...seriously?  MAKE AN APPOINTMENT!  I am the worst kind of procrastinator, and they literally fit me in right away.  A simple phone call is not that hard ladies.  I came to Pam needing a dress in hand to leave for my destination wedding the next week.  I was completely overwhelmed, but she quickly got down to business and helped me through the process of elimination.  I expected to like nothing that I tried on, instead I liked them all.  The prices here are amazing and I was able to buy any dress I looked at.  I was given honest feedback and quickly found the dress I wanted.  She matched it with a gorgeous veil in her store as well, and the price together was so great!  Alterations were measured while I was there that Thursday...and they got it back to me the very next Thursday!!  These ladies and this wonderful shop turned what I thought would be a scary, overwhelming, dreaded experience (hence the last minute) into an exciting, happy and joyous occasion!  The dress was HIT at my wedding.  Everyone commented on how it didn't look like the typical cookie cutter dress that so many are wearing these days.  Beautiful corset back and long train.  So lovely.  Thank you thank you thank you ladies!  This was a special day for my husband and I who have had so many struggles in dealing with being apart due to the military, and having the perfect dress and feeling like a bride made it that much better.  Would recommend Almond Tree to ANYONE.  Great selection, great staff and great prices.~~#~1
AZ Bread Company is one of my favorite lunch spots, and not just because it is a mile away from my office.They have amazing, fresh bread, delicious sides and high quality food.I normally always get the egg salad on Challah roll, but I have also had the egg salad stuffed tomato in the past. PS, they have amazing egg salad!!One of my favorite things about this place is the patio seating, especially since it is now fall (I can say that since we have two days in a row at 75 degrees for the high). Also, the interior is fun and brightly colored with a ton of windows making it full of natural light.The staff is always really friendly and you can often see the owner popping around making sure everyone is happy. I always feel... happy.. when I am here  :)~~#~1
One of my favorites, eat here all the time. Locals restaurant. Great service, friendly and efficient servers. Food is exceptional from the steak tacos to the burgers and daily specials. The owner Sheldon is always there which is why it is so successful. Ask for Amy, Jose,Becca or Natalie. Sunday brunch is great too. Wish I could give it more than 5 stars. The best of the best!!!!!!!~~#~1
As you can see I am catching up on my yelping tonight...All i can say about cadillac ranch in tempe is that I had the worst experience here ever. The service was horrible, and so was the manager. My friends and I went there around 8:15 p.m. We just wanted to get a few appetizers and a few drinks.  We had this young brunette waitress. We asked her what time they stopped serving food. (I don't like to order right before to closing). She said she thinks they stopped serving at 9:30 p.m. but the bar at 1 a.m. We asked for waters to start while look over the menu. 15 minutes later, we get our waters. We tell her we're ready to order so the 5 for us order a beer each. She tells us she'll be back in a min to get our food order.  30 min pass and we still don't get our drinks. We try to flag our server down and she just  tells us to wait a second. We finally get our  drinks at 9:15.  (we were being as patient as possible, because we've all worked in the service industry before.) We tell her we are ready to order food now. She tells us that they stopped serving food already!!! By that time I was pretty pissed. I ask to talk to the manager, and she asks WHY? haha.. So by then I didn't even want to deal with a  little girl who absolutely had no clue what she was doing. The manager approached the table. I told him exactly what had happened.  He advises us that they serve food until 1030 p.m.  He apologizes about his server and says it wasn't her fault because she was busy, and she is new.  By this time it was already passed 10 p.m. She brings the check by and says to us, "by the way, it only took me 10 minutes to get my drinks, not 45min. But I'm sorry." WOW... decide for yourselves everyone!Hopefully that waitress found a new career, and that manager(heavy set, man, with curly red hair) found another career as well. How hard is it to get decent service these days?~~#~0
The burgers are GIANT and really good!  Love the service with a smile !  They also serve breakfast all day, which is a plus in my book...next time I stop there, I am having breakfast for lunch:-)~~#~1
LOVE this Super Target! I ran in to get some mints this morning at 8am, and saw a HUGE, insane DVD sale...really? $3.74?  i walked out with my mints....and 7 DVD's (good movies, not the crappy, never-heard-of-them kind) for $32. Happy Easter to ME! lol~~#~1
I can't agree with the other ladies who have posted their experiences.  It's been awhile but the last time I did business with these guys I knew I would never go back.  I took my car in to have the wheels balanced after I had purchased a set of brand new wheels and tires from the internet.  When I mounted the new wheels I was getting a vibration at freeway speeds so I decided to take it to Tire Pros to have the wheels balanced.  They charged me a resonable price since I did not purchase the wheels from them.  When I got home I did a quick walk around the car and that's when I noticed one of my wheels had a piece of metal chipped off right at one of the holes for the lug nuts. I know it wasn't there before because they were brand new.  I called Tire Pros back and told them what I found.  They said to bring it back, which I did.  When I got there the manager said he asked the tech about it and he said the damage was already there!  The manager then said there was nothing they could do about it.  =/  Nothing I dislike more than a dishonest business.  If they admitted to it I would probably be able to forgive and forget but I just want others to know that they aren't the "Pros" their name claims to be.~~#~0
BEWARE THIS PLACE WILL RIP YOU OFF!!!  MAKE SURE YOU CHECK THE TOTAL OF YOUR ORDER WITH THEIR MENU PRICES!My wife and co workers ordered food last night.  They asked to pay separate for their orders.  The restaurant said it wasn't a problem.  They noticed after the fact that all 7 people were charged a $3 delivery fee.  THAT'S $21 ON TOP OF THEIR TIP THEY ALREADY GAVE THE DRIVER!!!  No one bothered to tell them they were getting hit up 7 times for a delivery fee, including the driver.They also asked if there were any specials or coupons going on at the moment.  The person on the phone said no.  They received a menu with their order and sure enough there were coupons.  On to the food, my wife's portion to the feast was salad.  For $14 she received 2 salads that fit in two small containers.  She said that a 99 cent salad at Wendy's had more going on than her $14 salads.  That's the last time anyone in this family orders from Rosatti's.   The bottom line is this area is CRAWLING with amazing Italian food.  IMHO, there is no room for ripping off your customers, there are so many other options in this area to choose from.  Judging by the low reviews and lack of effort this company is making to make things right, I can't see them being in business much longer.~~#~0
Sushi Time is as good as it gets! I live nearby and go at least once a week for happy hour.  Their happy hour specials are buy one get one rolls and buy a beer get a free hot saki!! for less than $40 two people can have 3-4 rolls and a couple of drinks each.  The food is excellent, the decor is simple, not much for atmosphere but you won't find better sushi in the area.  Score one for mom and pop!!~~#~1
Amazing! Such a fun little restaurant. It adds character to downtown Phoenix and the food is great! I got the hot cakes, which were huge and tasted so free, with real butter and real maple syrup. The service was friendly and the atmosphere made me feel like I was back in time at a cute little dinner but with a modern twist. My friend had the special, which was eggs benedict and hashbrowns. Also amazing and you can tell all the ingredients are farm fresh. I'm salvating just thinking about it! The wait wasn't too bad for us. We got their right around 9am and waited for 20 minutes, ate in 40 minutes. However there was quite the line of people after us. I don't suggest going in a large group and only go if you have time for a relaxing morning, long wait but they feed you quickly- but not rushed!~~#~1
Work conference sent me to the deserts of Arizona, or what my pal Natalie G. likes to call a microwave oven.  We headed over to this very relaxing hotel in the middle of nowhere this week.  I personally had a fantastic time here.  I don't know if it was the whole atmosphere itself but the hotel had a huge rack of decent amenities.  Maybe I'm use to paying city prices of 300+ with not much more than an ice box of a room.  But this room was huge including a kitchen, living room, bedroom and two flat screen tvs.  The pool was open pretty much all day and all night too.  The free happy hour and breakfast was lovely and the whole hotel made me feel very relaxed and comfortable.  Had a great "vacation"!  I mean work trip....~~#~1
Really quality vintage clothing. I have so much of my wardrobe from this boutique. Great styles, good prices and you cant leave this place without wanting to buy a trunk filled with goods. Honestly, one of the top 3 vintage shops in town. Service is awesome, per usual. Traci and Jasmine are always willing to offer any help and throw the best community events for their shop. A+++~~#~1
Wow, what a wine bar!  I loved it here!   I was impressed from the moment I walked in.  Here's why:For starters, they have indoor and outdoor seating. I felt relaxed and welcome from the moment I walked into this place.  Great setup, with ample seating throughout the location.  In the center of the bar, there are huge wine barrels set up with glass on top for seating.  In the center of the barrel are a bunch of corks, and you could easily seat 4 at each table.  They also have a bar as well, a couch at the front of the store, and a few tables off to the side.  Plenty of patio seating as well!I was immediately greeted by the owner, who is Australian.  He got me a drink as soon as I entered, and I continued to walk around and observe.He carries a bunch of wines, along with a great variety of accesories to go with it.  Corkscrews, books, wine racks, decorative items, etc.   Great selection of items.I find that this place is really worth going to.  He has great hours, the place is well decorated, and has an original "feel" to it.  The owner guy says he's been there for about 6 years.The only negative thing I have to write is that most of this merchandise you can find cheaper elsewhere.  (I got my wine rack at Cost plus Market for half the price he was charging.)  I noticed his wine selection was reasonable and large, and he seemed to have a fair selection for great prices.  But, as I mentioned earlier, things like corkscrews, wine racks, and general decor I felt was overpriced. Thats okay, I'm here for the wine anyways!~~#~1
My fiancé and I went into minibar ber shop today and he got an amazing cut from Jackie. My fiancé has had the same haircut for years and he was looking for something new. Jackie took the time to talk with him about what he wanted and then provided advice about what to do going forward. The place is very modern looking and had lots of fun trinkets you could buy for gifts. He will definitely be going back.~~#~1
Love.  Went again last month in June.  So excellent!!!~~#~1
So, I live near to the Gyro House. That being said, I love this place, the staff is friendly, everyone remembers the regulars, and it should get more exposure. The food is very good and really the owners add the little touch of care that I appreciate a lot. Every time I come I am stepping into a place where I am recognized and appreciated. It is a pleasant departure. It is small, the food is good, it is what you need.~~#~1
This place was a NIGHTMARE! I say this when comparing the Tempe Campus to the West and Downtown campus and the ASU Policies in general. I was misadvised by my program advisor two times - on major issues pertaining to acquiring my degree. Then my program changed advisors on me three times in two years. Then, when I was finally accepted into my program, the school decided to rewrite the curriculum! That gave me another headache and a half. I hated the parking situation... It is not fun walking 2432087 miles to class and then to the opposite side of the campus in 130 degree heat; and I hate President Crow for all the misery he has caused the people of the university. To add insult to injury, when it came time for me to graduate, I applied for graduation on time and my name wasn't even in the commencement book!! What was supposed to be the happiest moment of my young-adult life had me in TEARS!!!!~~#~0
My wife and I found a living room and dining set for our new house that we love. The salesman was extremely helpful and offered us all of these great deals.  It is now two months later and we still don't have the complete purchase.  The dining room table top has been sent back twice (the delivery men say this happens "all the time" due to damaged tops).  We were sent the wrong end tables.  The coffee table was damaged one delivery and smelled rancid the next.  That salesman we liked has a difficult time returning phone calls now too.  Fortunately, customer service has done their part to accommodate this circus of sending us seconds.  So much for a great deal.  Seven months later and we finally have all of the pieces for our family room... Four stars for the  furniture we really like, but felt the service was completely ridiculous... knocking the score down to one star.~~#~0
Took in my old laptop that had crashed and they were very honest in telling me it would be better for me just to purchase something new.  Thas is right! They turned down the "repair" job and gave me some great advice!  THANKS!~~#~1
I took my wife to eat at Twin Peaks after I had eaten in a South Carolina Twin Peaks. My wife and I were both happy with the service even though we arrived an hour before they closed. We were advised that we needed to order immediately if we wanted to eat because the kitchen was about to close. We ordered immediately and I ordered the wrong item. The waitress offered to give us the item at no charge and immediately resent our order without making us feel bad. The Beer was great and Ice cold. I cant say enough about the service out here. Thanks ladies for working so hard.~~#~1
We just recently moved out of these apartments and it was the best thing we ever did.  During our year of living in this lovely place we encountered tons of roaches, mold, and broken, run down equipment. Not to mention the management. They were the biggest jerks we have ever had to deal with. They never fixed our things in a timely matter nor did they care too. Very rude and ugly people.~~#~0
I love this place. It's so fun to make your own bowl and then watch it get cooked!  It's the best to get the udon noodles and tortillas! Mmmmm!  The staff here was always awesome.  I totally recommend this place!~~#~1
I have recently found this place and LOVE it!!! The staff are always easy to find and give wonderful recommendations based on comics and graphic novels I previously enjoyed. Every so often they have great sales that save a graphic novel freak, like me, tons of money. I highly suggest you check this place out if you are into comics, graphic novels or comic memorabilia.~~#~1
So, I hate to give Jalapenos a one star, however after the last visit I will most likely not return (nor will I be sending any business there)...My boyfriend and I went there, about 2 weeks ago, to celebrate our 1 year anniversary (kinda cheesy, but we had our first date there). We showed up later in the evening, about 8:30 pm, and because of this we inquired about their hours. The last thing either of us wanted to do was walk into a restaurant 20 minutes before they were closing. The hostess informed us that we had an hour, 9:30 pm closing, and she seated us. One of the servers promptly brought us chips and salsa, and water. Unfortunately that was all we were served for our meal. The 2 servers assisting the tables next to us refused to acknowledge our presence. Other employees began to take down tables, even though it was 9 pm. After 20 minutes of waiting, we finally left. I looked for someone to speak to, however all of the employees seemed to have dissapeared from the floor (as well as the hostess). By the time we got back to my side of town, it was too late to go to dinner. Happy anniversary?Anyways, because I really did like the restaurant, I called on Monday and spoke to one of the managers regarding the issue. While she apologized (and confirmed they close at 9:30 pm), she did not extend an invite back, and simply stated she would let the owner know. I never heard anything more, which was very surprising... while I was not looking for a free meal, a phone call would have been a nice follow-up from the owners. It only takes a couple of minutes...Anyways, we ended up celebrating our anniversary over lunch the next day at Blue Agave off of Scottsdale Rd and Mayo. Huge difference in service, delicious food and drinks, and reasonable prices. Considering that there isn't a huge difference in distance from Jalapenos, you would think their service would be a little bit better...~~#~0
First off I am not a hot dog person at all...but one amazing truck called Short Leash Hot Dogs has changed my life forever! Amazing, creative, unique and delicious are only a few descriptions I can say about these dogs. I was first introduced to Short Leash Hot Dogs through the Yelp science fair when they were handing out samples of their corn pups to everyone in line and thought they were super delicious, little did I know what other creations they had up their sleeve! I came across them again at the Devoured Culinary Classic where I got to try different samples and I also saw they encourage you to send them pictures of your dog so they can feature them with a special hot dog! Being the dog lover that I am, I sent one of the owners, Brad, an email the next day with a picture of my Siberian Husky named Sky. At the end of May Sky was the featured dog of the week with his own special hot dog made up of grilled pears, romaine lettuce, bacon, and blue cheese dressing. I was told it was hit, so I decided to take the pup with me downtown and get a chance to meet them and try the delicious hot dog!I have also tried other hot dogs on their menu, and you may be a little hesitant about some of the combinations of different ingredients, but trust me... they know exactly what they are doing and you will not be disappointed with any choice you make! I definitely recommend anyone and everyone to try Short Leash Hot Dogs just once, even if you are not a hot dog kind of a person!~~#~1
Customer service saves the day! This review is primarily about the amazing customer service I experienced today, but I can't help but gush about the store itself as well! Being originally from the Bay Area, I had the luxury of growing up with a Nike Town within driving distance, so I was very excited to learn of the Nike store opening up at the Scottsdale Quarter. While on the hunt for a new pair of running shoes, I decided to see if the Nike store had them before purchasing them online. I visited the store and was immediately pleased by the stock, decor and overall feel of the store. It made me want to run 5 miles then and there! Sadly though, they didn't have the shoes in the color I was looking for. Apparently, I'm so "trendy" (note the sarcasm in the reference to being trendy) that the shoe color I wanted had only come out the day before! So ordering online it was. I ordered my shoes last Saturday, but Friday came and I hadn't heard a peep from Nike about my order...no email either. I decided to call the online store, only to be treated pretty rudely by the woman on the other line who told me that my order didn't exist and that I was wrong in saying that my credit card had been charged. However, I was sitting in front of my computer and had the proof that my card had in fact been charged. I tried explaining that my card had been charged, but she was instant that it was only a hold and that my order hadn't been placed (Wells Fargo confirmed that the card had in fact been charged and wasn't pending.) When I asked to speak with a Nike manager, I was hung up on. Needless to say, I was pretty upset and all I wanted were my tennis shoes without being charged twice! Before I filed a dispute with Wells Fargo, I decided to give the Nike store a call. The associate Ali picked up the phone and immediately started working with me to get my issue resolved. She took down my information and said that she'd look into it and call me back. Just like she promised, I received a call back from her within 15 minutes. Not only was she incredibly friendly and customer-service oriented, but she also found my order (even though the rude online customer service rep claimed it didn't exist). She gave me my order number, shipping number and tracking number and told me that my shoes are set to arrive on Monday. Voila! Thanks to Ali, I found my shoes, I wasn't charged twice and I didn't have to file a dispute with my bank. I must note that after speaking with the online rep and being treated so rudely, I vowed never to shop at Nike again. However, after the friendly treatment by Ali and eagerness to get my issue resolved, I am a believer in Nike again. Nike's online reps should take a few lessons from friendly associates like Ali on how to treat customers.~~#~1
Yes, as someone stated before, this place makes hooters look like a classy restaurant. You walk in, and the nurse tells you to sit wherever you want at this enormous awkwardly shaped table (a cross). I'm sure the owner or whoever designed it thought it was brilliant, but it was really awkward seating for our 6 person group. You sit on the outside of the cross, and the "nurses" work on the inside, taking orders/serving, etc. The inner lining of the cross also has mirrors, so you can check out your ugly nurses' asses from a variety of unflattering angles. And you end up staring and being stared at by other patrons of the restaurant, since you have to sit facing them.The food is really disappointing. Seriously, you expect the food at HAG to be like a "guilty pleasure," but for being that unhealthy, it has no flavor. Apparently, all they really intend is to clog your arteries, not to feed you something delicious. You can't justify putting that food in your mouth, because it tastes like soggy mush. Each patty is a half pound of unseasoned beef, cheese is optional. You have to go up and get your own tomatoes/onions/pickles (no lettuce), and also your own fries (which they charge extra for, and only put out in small batches, so you have to wait in line to get them since they run out so quickly). The fries, yes you would expect them to be delicious for being fried in lard, but no, they are soggy and gross. It was basically eating some disgusting potato and ketchup casserole. Oh, and all beverages come in a bottle, including water, which is another way for this cheap restaurant to charge you. Our "nurse" (i.e. waitress) was also 40+ years old, and should not have been wearing that skimpy outfit, and the other nurse was too fat for her job. I guess they make the ugly nurses work during weekdays (jk..not really). The service was terrible too. Seriously, there was barely anyone there, and the nurses acted like they were busy doing something, and never tended to us or followed up with us. Like dumbas$es we still paid tip.Anyway, go to hooters if you want better tasting food, better service, and better looking waitresses. I'm sure it's equally unhealthy, so don't feel bad. If you want burgers however, Red Robin has a tasty selection,, and their fries are absolutely delicious (and they bring them to you, so you're not standing in line like an a$$). Come to think of it, I think HAG stole their menu from In-N-Out. The burgers are the same, just bigger and flavorless. At In N Out, you can order a hamburger, a cheeseburger, a double-double, and then the "secret menu" of increasing cheeseburger sizes, and  which is exactly what HAG does. Basically, the way HAG runs its restaurant is to cut corners. Make you serve yourself, while still bringing your food to you to collect tip. The huge table is easy to service, cuz hey, it's just one huge table. You're not really engaged in what is supposed to be an amazing and awesomely unhealthy experience to remember. Nothing is fun about being at HAG. They don't live up to the theme of the restaurant than say, 5&Diner where you get the feel that you're in a 50s diner. Oh, and the music sucks.Bottom line, go to this restaurant if you want to clog your arteries. That's all you'll get out of your experience. That and regret.~~#~0
Ive never been a huge fan of indian food. This place may have changed my mind. Dont be fooled by the location its alot nicer on the inside then it appears from the parking lot. The staff was really nice and the pricing was very reasonable. 4 entrees and 2 appetizers for 40 bucks. Ill be back for sure.~~#~1
Some of the finest Thai food in the valley. Great service, nice environment,  wonderfully prepared food. However, I would like to quibble with a previous reviewer-- this is NOT the hottest Thai food around. It has been moderated somewhat for American tastes. (I have been to Thailand 3 times so I should know) The hottest Thai food and amazingly good as well is Thai Lahna. Espeically if Thom is cooking. But Malee's is excellent, excellent food. Great service. I love the place.~~#~1
I'll second Abu J's critique on this diamond in the rough!  YUMMY! After reading his review I had to rush off and try this place out. It is the real deal... inexpensive, tasty, open late, wow. They have just released their first ad so you had better get in before everyone finds out and it becomes too popular.  I Can't wait to get back and try more of their dishes. ;)SeanJust noticed that I had not posted this review properly and so there it sat in my outbox. Oop's...Well, I have since dined at the Pasta Bar 6 or 7 more times to only be more and more satisfied with their product. Still 5 stars!Sean~~#~1
This store is kick ass. Picked up a pair of Jordan Spi'zikes today with no mark up they had plenty to choose from. I loved the sale they recently had on all the retro AJ1's too... picked up the red do the right thing pack for 30% off, came out to like $75 total.... for a pair of AJ1's! I dropped almost twice that on some pairs. They have all the awesome shoes and can make special orders since they are a Nike top dealer. Staff is very friendly and knowledgeble. Weird that Adrian Wilson owns the place.~~#~1
My boyfriend and I try to eat very healthy and were in the area and hungry for dinner. We saw Zoe's  kitchen and thought we would give it a try... The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because the girl at the counter was pretty friendly. The food however was bland and terribly unimpressive. I had the Chicken Roll-ups and they were cold, pre-made and lacking in any culinary skill what so ever.  When I ordered them I asked if i could get spinach instead of lettuce and she said they are pre-made every morning so I can't change anything... Also, They claim to be a "healthy alternative" and they ONLY have white flour tortillas and do not offer wheat. In my fruit salad there were 2 ROTTED grapes and when my boyfriend showed them they said "oh, ok, sorry" then went back to whatever they were doing...Honestly, there are many better alternatives to go to and spend $7-$10 a plate... I do not recommend going there at all~~#~0
The Rock - I love you. The bartenders and cocktail servers are so sweet and friendly and the drink prices are AMAZING ($3.50 long island iced teas? Yes please!). They treated us so wonderfully for my sister's bachelorette party - we went and saw the Barbra Seville show with Celia Putty, Diva, and more! We had the best time. I love the Rock and definitely plan on coming back - especially for the amazing drag shows!~~#~1
Rachel, our server, is a historian. And she's historically accurate, which is to say, she's the reason we now dine here on the blood of enemies after our hockey games instead of Four Peaks. Pete, one of the other servers, accused her faking the other reviews about this place for her benefit. Well, it's true, I am Rachel and I have obtained Elite status as Richard Z, Brad E and Dallas G For the purpose of self promoting. It's taken me two years but it was well worth it. Meanwhile, the veggie burger is good, the onion rings are as well, and the wii and the $60,000 live action video game system make me stay for more abuse from Richie Z. Brad E beat me really hard in a sword fight last week as well.   It's good. If you're here, eat here.~~#~1
It's a sad state of affairs when my husband and I are driving around looking for homes for sale within walking distance of Fibber Magees.  We like the place that much.  We went again today and ordered the mussels, which always make me blaspheme with pleasure they are so good.  They are on par with fresh mussels I've had on the coasts.  Just amazing.  And the broth is bacony and oniony and peppery.  They give you one slice of very good garlic bread per order, which is really not enough.  That order should come with two pieces so I don't have to pay a buck for another one or start dipping things like french fries and tacos in that wonderful broth.  One of these days I'm going to ask Kevin to hook me up with a dirty martini with about a 1/2 shot of that broth.We typically get the fish and chips, which have always been perfect, but today for some reason I tried something different.  I had the pork tacos app for my meal and it came with four fat stuffed little soft shells with some tasty tomatillo salsa and pico de gallo.  Tender pork and flavorful salsa.  My belly was very happy.  I topped that with a Newcastle, and then was feeling frisky so I asked Kevin for one of those Three Olives Froot Loop drinks.  Great dessert.  Trust me.  The Baileys Bread and Butter Pudding is a stellar dessert choice as well.  Mr. M had the cod sandwich and it was fried perfectly, as the fish always has been there.  It may seem simple to some, but there's really an art to cooking fish.  It doesn't take much to overcook it and whoever is frying it up back in Fibber's kitchen knows what they are doing.   I don't usually eat a lot of fries but theirs are like crack for me because they are skinny and brown and salty.  Mmmmmm mmm mmm.  And I will say a few of them got dipped in that mussels broth and that was delicious. So my only simple request, with eyes wide open like Puss In Boots in the Shrek movies, is to add a second piece of garlic bread to the mussels order.  Maybe do only one when it's half off during happy hour, but faith n' begorrah, one just isn't enough!!~~#~1
They carry Orion Beer.  Instant win.  Sometimes finding things can be difficult but keep looking, it's there.  They have everything you need to make Asian, Middle Eastern and just about any other Non-European cuisine you can think of. Great deals on frozen pita and flat bread.  Much cheaper than anywhere else.~~#~1
That's one good things about being a restaurant critic or a fact checker! My wife and I believed that mexican food is great in this restaurant . I don't usually don't order other food than Green Corn Tamale. Although, my last try of  Carne Asada was not that good and our recent visit we found out that  both our forks was cleaned well. Still, I will give this restaurant a five star review because of your unsurpassed green corn tamale.  We will be back next time and check those corrections  and will be firm in making the next review. So, always on the look out, Keeps those utensils clean and maintain a standard in your food preparation. We promise we will come and visit again.~~#~1
I love this place! This was my second visit, and although I want to try other things, I can't help but order the meatball sliders!! Deeee-lish!! The place is clean and the young people that work here are super friendly. I just moved around the corner, and this is one of my new favorites!! Gotta love the Meatballz!!~~#~1
We did a google search to find an italian restaurant near my mother's house.  What a find!!!  The service was AMAZING!!!  the staff so friendly and helpful.  The food was amazing and filling.  Prices were great too.  Definitely will revisit and recommend to friends!!!~~#~1
Eat here regularly, I get the Gyro and my wife the Lamb Slovaki and the fries are fabulous.~~#~1
Picked up a Raspberry Chiffon Pie.  Easily could make 8 ample servings.  The Crust was nice.   The Pie was super fresh and Traci's Commercial Kitchen is spotless.   Pass up the Pie at the local Grocers as you will not get the quality or taste that the Pie Snob will fulfill.   This small business is a hidden gem located in a central phoenix neighborhood.  The Pie was full of sweet and tangy flavor.  Fresh Red raspberrys in a raspberry glaze, covered generously with Raspberry Chiffon and then covered with a hefty amount of real Whipped cream which was not overly sweet.~~#~1
Wonderful food! Don't be deceived by the outside. This is on the end of a mini mart-Circle K. It is one of those holes in the wall locations, but WOW is not a big enough word to describe it. Went in for the pizza and ended up with a seafood pasta dinner that was delicious. It was served in the pan it was cooked in on really nice plates. We were served an appetizer of bread with chopped tomato & onions in vinegar & oil. We were greeted by the owner himself. It is really small inside, so seating is limited. There were a lot of take outs for pizza, and they have this really long pizza that is one of their specials. Can't wait to go back for the wood burning oven pizza!~~#~1
I have to eat where I can when it comes to lunch time as I am always in different places because of work. This has led me to a lot of restaurant dabbling. This review is for those who think all chain restaurants are created equal.I have eaten at probably at least 10-12 different Filibertos throughout the valley and the only one that comes close to this one is the one off of Stapley and Main but even they can't match up to this location.Who love's to eat their long craved Carni Asada Burrito only to bite into the rubbery grissle of the poorly cut steak?Definitely not me. I've experienced this at various Fili B's but have to say not as frequent as other competing burrito places so have to hand it to em.This location is one of only two I have been to that I have never had this experience and the other one is the one mentioned above. ONE of only TWO. I have frequently ate at some of these locations a many as 15-20+ times. When I find myself standing in the sun waiting for a long time for 1 burrito only for them to cheap on the amount of hot sauce they give me. I end up mumbling to myself wishing this location was closer.You can go this location and dine in the A/C 24 hrs. a day. Serve yourself up as much hot sauce as you want. The green sauce is made like no other so don't expect it to taste like the others it's wayyy better. I would have to say the wait time for the food is darn close to twice as fast as the other locations.Already a Fili B's fan? This place will make wish the others will get there act together because this one puts the rest to shame.~~#~1
This pub is on the end off Mill... So for those who can make it past all the bars through the block lies this gem. It's signifigantly less crowded than any other bar on Mill, serves my favorite beer (Magners), has a huge outside patio for socializing however still has local bands play inside some nights. Very chill place, absolutely love it.~~#~1
I was in for a great surprise when I walked in Thursday afternoon. I was with my baby and craving something sweet, yet sour and also good for me. I walked in and was immediately greeted/served by Betty's husband. After going through a display case of flavors to choose from, he told me they have key lime pie with homemade graham cracker crust. I swear, he read my mind! So happy, I almost snagged it from his hand. I sat down, baby was sleeping, and quietly enjoyed my key lime paleta. It was creamy, and very tart with a little sweetness. Just the way I love key lime pie. The crust is what made it all come together. I can't wait to go in for more. Especially after talking to Betty herself. She said everything is fresh. Meaning no frozen fruits/juices added and flavors are seasonal.~~#~1
Wonderul family owned business.  The takeout is fast and the eat in business is lovely.  I love the Pad See Ew! Have brought friends here and it is now our new favorite lunch stop.~~#~1
Visiting some friends in Phoenix and saw all the great reviews on Yelp for Lo-Lo's.  Any place that includes chicken & waffles in its name has to be able to back that up!Short version: everything was wayyyy better than we could have hoped for!  Possibly the best friend chicken I've ever had - golden brown and moist & juicy with excellent batter.  The straight-up fried chicken is superb, but I ordered mine "smothered" with chicken-onion gravy and it was soooo good.  The waffles are also great - light and flavorful batter with a hint of cinnamon.  And yes, Lo-Lo's proves that chicken & waffles belong together!Honorable mention: the sides.  We tried collard greens, fried okra, creamy grits and candied yams (some of the best I've ever had).  Not a single wrong order out of a table of 5 on our first visit - doesn't that tell you something?~~#~1
Great prices and a variety of ethnic foods~~#~1
Ben avery is always a great place to go shooting, it does get busy on the weekend when all the 9-5ers come out to shoot. If i can i go during the week heck i was their yesterday 5/26/10. Its a bit of a drive but they open at 7am during the summer months so you can be out shooting while its not 100. If its your first visit you'll have to watch the safty video, its only a few minutes long.I guess the worst thing about this place is the morons who can't follow range commands.~~#~1
Do you remember all the cant through out history?  Well, they do!  This is definitely the place to shop if your a "Candy Addict".  And even if they don't carry some off the wall you're looking for they can special order.  Can't get much cooler than that.  If you have a sweet tooth, this place is recommended.  Conveniently located a block and a half south of the 3rd St & Mill Ave Metro stop.  Easy to make a candy run while on the way to of from down town.~~#~1
I love green. I've been eating there for a few years now, and while it may not be the healthiest veg good, it is delicious. I was very disappointed today when one of the girls (a blonde haired girl) at the front desk was incredibly rude  after I inquired about the kind of "meat" being used. She refused to talk to me about it, saying it was secret. Shocked, I stated that businesses really should disclose that type of info without hesitation, and she said "no, they don't and aren't going to." I thought she was very hostile even though I was just curious. It's not like I was going to try and steal their recipes!  Staff should be friendly and understanding about questions, its what makes customers trust and support their efforts.~~#~0
My wife and I took a 2-day trip to Scottsdale and stayed at the W hotel after we got married. This spa is located inside the hotel and everytime we walked by it, it smelled like heaven.We made appointments a few weeks before via phone. It was easy and fast. As we entered the spa we were treated with great hospitality and were sent on our separate ways for our massages. I got the Bliss 75 massage with the Stress Reducer add-on. An employee brings you into a little room to wind down, fill out a health questionnaire and enjoy the mini brownie, cracker and cheese bar they have. They also show you the shower area which is connected to the little room. They have regular showers and steam showers. The bliss bathroom has all the bliss products for use after your treatment, from shaving gel and lotions, to facewash and soaps. All free of course!I was pretty impressed with the cleanliness, the service and the amenities they had there.The massage was pretty damn awesome. It was my first full body massage and it was a comfortable experience.I highly recommend this place if you are interested in pampering yourself. There are other locations in the country so I assume they all hold the level of standard that the Scottsdale establishment has. Note that its pricey, I would go here again only during special occasions for a total wind-down. Nevertheless, its gotten my full attention and deserves its 5-star rating.~~#~1
Huge selection of great tasting food, have tried pretty much every except the shrimp tacos and it is all great. All food is made fast and fresh by friendly people. If you haven't tried it and would like something better than Taco Bell then it is a must.~~#~1
I ordered three kinds of dark chocolate bark for a baby shower, attended by some friends and colleagues with discerning palates.  Cocoa Palette came through beautifully.  First, their dark chocolate bark is very impressive:  high quality chocolate with creative toppings, reflecting the artistry that justifies the title "chocolatier" for its owner, Angela.  Second, Angela worked with me to custom-make some bark with variations of the toppings listed on their website and to provide a discount for a significant order.  Preferring simplicity, I requested my personal favorite for half the order:  dark chocolate with toasted almonds.  But another flavor proved to be a surprisingly big hit:  dark chocolate with herbs de provence and a special chardonnay salt; it was amazing.  The dark chocolate with lavender and lemon was also an eye-opener, although most people are satisfied with just a small taste of the lavender.  If you want to impress a dark chocolate lover, or make a splash at a dinner party, check out the chocolate bark or the equally creative chocolate truffles at Cocoa Palette.~~#~1
Ok, so why the heck have I not been here sooner?! (bad llama - ok, if u didn't see the movie emperor's new groove, never mind - and I'm off the subject matter here...)Sat at the nice & spacious bar where we were (ok, that looks weird: a lot of 'w' & 'e's) very promptly served and waited on for over an hour.  The steak flatbread was awesome!  Nom~Nom~Nom.  Paired with the perfect glass of cab: sequoia grove - MmmmmmmmI will definitely be back.~~#~1
I really enjoyed staying here. The service and amenities were great!It's an Inn so the place is on the smaller side, but it offers more than most hotel chains and the staff was always available and friendly.  My room was clean and I liked the flat screen tv and the fact that I had a mini fridge in my room to save stuff in. There's a coffee maker and a microwave in the room too. A complimentary copy of USA Today was provided every morning and the staff was great about providing extra lotions, shampoos, soaps, and towels.There's free wi-fi in all the rooms and in the lobby. If you don't have a computer, there's even a computer and printer available in the lobby that is free to use. The pool and gym are open until midnight and breakfast is served for free in the mornings from 6-10am.  Bacon, waffles, juice, yogurt, sausage...all you can eat...woo hoo!Use your AAA card for an extra discount when booking online.~~#~1
Went with my 19 year old son for late breakfast today. Sadly, the food is delicious. It's everything else that ruined it! The waitress never cracked a smile and just seemed annoyed to even have to wait on us. We are about the friendliest people you could wait on so I have to believe she either doesn't like her job or just has a general over-all bad attitude. My son and I both ordered waffles. There was no syrup on the table so I asked her to bring some maple syrup with order. After she walked away we noticed that we were the only table without a bottle of syrup, so I grabbed a bottle from the table next to us. The waffles came, hot and delicious. When we got the check my son picked it up to look at it and he noticed that there was a charge of $1.75 for each of our little individual syrups that came with the waffle (which neither of us ended up using as we used the large bottle we had grabbed from the other table). When I asked the waitress about the charge she told me that "we had ordered syrup". I , of course said I had just asked for syrup ( not ordered) their "gourmet" syrup that I didn't even know about! She said she would have the manager take it off. She ended up sending some other employee over who insisted I had ordered syrup, which I guess translated into ordering their SPECIAL syrup. If you think this is sounding absurd, we're on the same page! I am the least picky or cheap person you could ever meet! It was 100% the principle! I even gave the lackluster waitress a 20% tip just because that's the kind of person I am! In the end, they took the charge off for one of the syrups because I had opened mine, but son hadn't. Mr. or Ms. Manager.....shame on you! In this day and age, the least we can expect when we have lots of dining options is to be treated as a valued customer! I'll be going back to Butterfields where there is good food and service with a smile!~~#~0
In my quest for really good coffee shops, I look for 5 things and each get a star if they're up to par. 1. Fresh coffee, 2. breakfast, 3. unique atmosphere, 4. comfort, 5. ambient music. Press has it all...~~#~1
Loved this place!The food was Amazing and Simple. I ordered the Porky which has pork, onions, apples, potatoes, sage and a side of red wine gravy and fell in love with this dish. This dish was perfectly blanaced with just the right amount of sweet and saltiness and the crust was perfect.They have a pretty good drink selection here and the service is great. I would recommend this place to anyone.~~#~1
Closed as of June 1. Moment of Silence~~#~1
Staff is welcoming. New thin and crispy pizza is really good. Reasonably priced wine.  Great value for the money.~~#~1
I can probably just give 5 stars just for the Stetson Chopped Salad. And the Wild Boar Meatballs with the delicious cream sauce. And the fabulously fatty Berkshire Pork Belly.We also ordered the Cheeky Porky, but I found the pork cheek meat to be a little bit on the dry side. But, the accompanying pancakes were good, along with the sauce that topped it.Our waiter was attentive. We had a table along the windows which provided a great view for people watching.Great place to dine, if you're ever in the downtown Scottsdale area.~~#~1
No cheese means no cheese. Shame on me for thinking the employees at the Arrowhead location can read. I will never order from Jason's again.~~#~0
great service all around.  great techs/staff and dr burns is really accessible unlike some other vets.  they do a great job following up after visits, and they are great about not upselling tests/medicines/procedures.  pricing is very fair.  i've been going here for a couple years now, and i've always been very happy.~~#~1
This is one of the few places in the valley to get BOBA shakes.  For this alone i give them 5 stars.~~#~1
What's not to love about Camelback Ranch?? I'm a Dodgers fan so of course I'm going to love it here. Been coming here for the past 3 years for spring training. Love the way it's set up and you get to see the players practice in the outer fields before the game starts (get there early!). It's great because you get some great pics of the players. Love the food. Yummy lemonade!! Great seats anywhere and easy to get to. It does get hot in Phoenix so we got up a couple times to stand under the shade. Will be coming back for sure. They have Dodger dogs!!! :))) NOTE: Do not park in the dirt parking lot when you first come up on the ranch. It is pretty far from the entry and when you leave at the end of the game, you will be stuck in the parking lot for a LONG time. Keep going down the street and you will find closer parking to the ranch. Have fun!!~~#~1
Remember those cool glasses you saw your colleague/friend/date/hot waiter wearing the other day that made you rethink your contact lenses?Chances are they got them at Sassy.  Sassy Glasses is THE place to go if you want unique and cool frames in any style, from 'button down business' to 'far-outfunky', at a variety of price points.  The owners are knowledgeable and attentive, and most importantly, patient, which is nice, because the offer so many styles to choose from.Even better Sassy is  a locally owned, independent business, so more of your hard earned money stays in town.  The only downside is that they don't take insurance (directly) and have no optometrist on site, or close by, although they will refer you to one)~~#~1
4 STARS???If I could I would be all up in giving 0 stars in this motherfucker.I visited Ticoz based on the many good reviews. FAIL!Is TICOZ short for TOSTITOS?Because I swear... the chips served by the waiter were out of a cellophane bag from Costco. Margarita.... more ice than anything. Bleh.Service.... poor. We waited to be seated. We waited to have a drink order taken. Waited to get our drinks. The main courses were bizarre to say the least.The "tamales" were more like 2 scoops of sweet corn polenta.The shrimp were in a pile next to it, rubbery, frozen, slightly off flavored. The rice and beans, generic.The burgers were more like sliders. I think the burgers are prepared far in advance and assembled prior to serving. The bun was made soggy by the watery salsa. The mayo... became watery from the salsa as well. The cole slaw was bleh. The waffle fries were decent.The waiter was just weird. He was disengaged, unfriendly, and sluggish.Yo what be up wit yo foolz an yo fo stah reviews?!@!One of the worst places I have eaten in Phoenix - super trendy looking, with miserable vittles.1 star, only because there is no way to give 0 stars.Word is bond!~~#~0
Where do I begin?  Let's just say that my visit to Star Nails and Wax was beyond horrible.  Upon being seated for my pedicure, I instantly overheard the cosmetologist make a snide comment about my feet.  Of course she wasn't remarking this in English, but rather in Vietnamese which I understand.  I did not let on that I spoke the language in order to see what other choice things that she had to say to me.  Needless to say, the rest of the visit continued on this negative note.After soaking my feet, the technician then tried to use a dirty towel to dry them off.  At this point I should have gotten up and walked away, but I did not listen to my instincts.  I let them continue and am sorry that I did.  The completed product was not a pleasant sight.  In the store, the color they chose was a very light pink, however upon returning to my residence I noticed that the color was a very dark and unappealing shade.  I had to remove the color from my feet and repaint them myself.Not only was the service poor but the end result was not worthy of the relatively high prices that they charge.  If you wish to come to an condescending and incompetent nail salon, feel free to check out Star Nails and Wax, but please leave any reasonable expectations at the door.~~#~0
THIS STORE CLOSED RECENTLY. I'm really going to miss this little gem.~~#~1
Ask for Jose. He's the most genuine and helpful associate. He's spectacular.~~#~1
I love that they know me here, I feel like my bank actually cares...I know it's weird but I trust them!~~#~1
After a year in Portland, Oregon we have found a single spot for decent BBQ, and it was much more expensive than Joe's for much less food. We will struggle on here in the Rose City (loving the city just not the lack of good BBQ) as we continue to pine away for Joe's...~~#~1
I WISH we had a Yard House in the Bay Area!  It's soooo good!  First off, they have every kind of beer imaginable on tap.  Seriously, I think they hold a record for how many different kind of beers they have.  Don't let that sway you, this place isn't some local pub or anything.  It has a really posh, sophisticated atmosphere.  The menu is BEST PART!  They have a range of things to order from your favorite kind of burgers and sandwiches to amazing asian/latin fusion dishes! Happy hours are a great time to come for apps and cheap drinks! Cheers!~~#~1
I have not been back here for about a year.  What a mistake to wait that long...  All the food is well above par with creative spins on traditional items that make you wonder why everyone does not make them this way. Delicious and creative food and drink.  Very friendly people and atmosphere.They have a lot of ingredients that you might not see on a menu very often.  For Example.. Chimichurri, kalamata olives, haricot verts, manchego cheese and the way the put them together make for happy mouths.   They have a great selection of veggie options too.  Then there are the drinks...  Wow...The Mexican chocolate latte!!!!  The white sangria!  Ginger Mojito!!  You just have to try it.I cannot wait to go back and try more!~~#~1
great place!!!~~#~1
I love coming here. When ever my wife says we are going to yard house I get so happy. I love all the beers on tap, and the sampler which rotates every Tuesday is a nice starting point. I get the same feeling of getting to go to chuck e cheese as a kid when I go here. I love yard house.~~#~1
Love, love, love this place. My lunch break is at 8am in the morning and they always let me make a greek salad early in the morning. Food is always fresh and service is awesome!~~#~1
Hey, why oh why can't you be in California?  There should be a law requiring one of these near my house.  It's not fair.Food Network turned me on to these incredibly creative entrepreneurs and so they were on my list of "must try next time I am in Phoenix".  After experiencing other ice cream shops in the area, and trust me, I tried many, this wins hands down.  Their ice cream is top notch, creamy, good.  I especially enjoyed the vanilla almond crunch (they sneak cinnamon into the mix), and the basil lime sorbet. Can't wait for my next trip.  Sweet Republic, you rock!~~#~1
I working in coffee for three years and its often hard to find a spot I want to give money to. Lola I can dig though. I think the owners name is David, but regardless- he makes the blend of coffee they use. The blend is brilliant and full of flavor. The staff is always friendly and the spot just looks great; the furniture, the art, the music. Great modern coffee house vibe.~~#~1
One of the most genius concepts of our time. $15 a month for 2 movies at a time, as many as you can squeeze in. I heard from someone you can also copy them to your computer and watch them when you have time :). You can build quite the library selection this way :) and always have something for every mood waiting in the wings. Instant queue is fabulous as well. Tons of flicks are right there on demand and included in your membership costs. The iPhone app for this lets you add and browse on here, or just go to the Netflix website. Also tons of TV shows as well. I've logged a lot of hours watching some old canceled series' I used to really enjoy. Also pulling up some real gems of movies from my childhood that are good for a laugh! If you try something and it sucks, just delete from the queue and move on it. It's just perfection. Absolutely genius. If you don't have a membership, sign up. I don't think there is anything else I would recommend more highly.~~#~1
I'm surprised at some of the bad reviews I've seen for Over Easy.  The food here was fantastic!  We're only visiting Phoenix for a week and we've already eaten there twice and plan to one more time. What really makes them stand out is the attention and care they put into the food.  Every dish seems to have just a hint of extra spice or subtle flavor that elevates it above standard breakfast fare.  This is not just grub thrown together.  We've found it to be not just one of the best breakfasts we've ver had, but a great meal, period.Freshly made corned beef hash that has the look and texture of canned, but with a phenomenally fresh taste and a smokey sweetness that is amazing.  Malt waffles that are delicately crisp but have a nutty subtext that will astound.  The best, and I mean BEST chicken-fried steak I've ever had, and I love CFS.  Again, it's the care.  Crisp and fresh batter that has the texture and flavor of great fried chicken.  A wonderful sauce that has a spice you can't quite place but makes it unique.  Only beef:  The pastries (we tried the blueberry muffins and the cinnamon roll) are obviously brought in and were waaaaaay overpriced and nowhere near up to the standards of the rest of the food.  Avoid the baked stuff.Next trip it's the biscuits and gravy...can't WAIT!~~#~1
Visiting Postino Wine Cafe makes me feel like I am in another city... an urban, metro, pedestrian city such as San Francisco. Its casual, yet sophisticated and quite enjoyable. I recently visited Postino with two friends and had the Bruschetta -- we selected the Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato and Basil, the Smoked Salmon and the Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese. Thumbs up on all of these yummy appetizers! The clientele is a hip, diverse crowd reflective of its gentrified, charming neighborhood of mid-century ranch homes, and yet just a hop from the Biltmore and Arcadia neighborhoods. Ah... Phoenix is growing up! Wish I knew more about wines to tell you more about that. It appeared to be a nice selection and there were bottles you can buy to take home as well. Parking is a challenge, however I will definitely be back.http://www.postinowinecafe.com/Update: Postino's is one of many restaurants/bars in AZ that permits concealed weapons without permits and is noted on the Arizona State Rifle and Pistol Association in their CCW Cafe page: http://www.asrpa.com/ccwcafe.html For that reason I am reducing the previously 5-star rating to 1-star.~~#~0
Love the ambience of this place! The night we went, there was a guy playing the piano in the bar who was awesome! The recent night we visited we only had a cocktail and happy hour menu, but we have eaten here before and it is divine! We will definitely be doing dinner here again soon! Drinks are super pricey, but that seems to be the norm for this type of restuarant.~~#~1
Don't let the obvious IKEA lights put you off: Canteen has captured lightning in a bottle, as far as Mill Avenue is concerned. I was present for drinks at the Grand Opening, for Happy Hour on a second visit and for dancing on a third. Truly, Canteen operates masterfully at each of these levels, all while somehow managing to maintain an air of that oh-so-elusive adjective: class.Canteen keeps business good by opening only at 4PM, which is just in time for their Happy Hour. At this time, the place is slow, but the food is delicious and the prices are right. A plate of three gourmet miniature tacos for less than $5 hits the spot, and don't even get me started on their on-the-rocks style margaritas. Delicious, wickedly strong and, thankfully, made of forgiving ingredients including agave nectar, lime juice and 100% agave tequila. Just one or two of these is more than enough to get the party started. In addition to great food and drink, it seems that Canteen has gone to extraordinary lengths to hire only waitstaff that might make the pages of GQ or Maxim, and are incredibly personable too boot. As afternoon fades into night, the lights dim, candles are lit and the music swells. Canteen has concocted the perfect atmospheric blend of fun, friendly, upscale and intimate.On weekends, however, it's another story. The tables are moved aside and people pour onto the patio, where there is an open bar (that, oddly enough, served only margaritas and did not know what a "Citron and tonic" was, but who am I to complain?). Somehow, everything that is wrong with Mill remains far away from Canteen, as if the place is protected by some sort of enormous bro-squito net. The people are beautiful, well dressed (not a popped collar in sight) and, for the most part, the men seem to understand the concept of "look, don't touch." Ten of us arrived on a Saturday, and it took us no time at all to vote our night at Canteen the best we've ever had. Great music, great drinks, great dancing without any of the cheap alcohol, sweat and lecherousness that generally ruins a perfectly good night out with the girls.All in all, Canteen has my vote, day and night.~~#~1
Ate here 2x yesterday! I had my boyfriend go and pick it up. Great food. Always see people cleaning, asking to help customers, and working like a team!~~#~1
This is the way food should taste!!  I remember eating tomatoes right out of my grandmother's garden and the organic fruits and vegetables from Boxed Greens taste just as fresh!!  Things from the store just are not the same or as healthy for you.  The earl ybird option for us works great.  Like getting fresh milk "back in the olden days".  (not that I'm that old).  If there is ever a problem I can call them up and the friendly staff is willing to solve the problem right away. You won't go wrong by making the healthy   choice by ordering from Boxed Greens!!~~#~1
The staff here are always cheerful, friendly and helpful -- even when the place is crawling with people.  The prices are no worse than anywhere else and they have a fantastic stock of kits on the shelves and put together as examples.~~#~1
Drive-up ordering box broken for months, today at lunch ordered a Double Del Cheeseburger but they had no meat to make burgers.  Need I say more! Off too Whataburger.~~#~0
Our daughter has been at Arcadia Montessori for a year and we absolutely love it.  She has blossomed there with a sense of both independence and responsibility and we attribute much of that development to the Montessori method and her fantastic teachers and aides.  The campus is beautiful and well maintained, and the classrooms are clean.  We truly feel that everyone who works at the school and in her classroom truly cares about her development and well-being.  Arcadia Montessori gives us the peace of mind we need in a household where both parents work and we want the best childcare for her age.~~#~1
At One Yoga took my level of practice up a notch. The number of classes a week and the times makes it easy for anyone to work into their weekly schedule. The different types of classes gets me in the door no matter how I feel that day. If I'm tired, the basic class is perfect or if I feel like I am wanting to challenge myself with a new pose, the power or Astanga class makes me feel like I have accomplished a pratice. I also see quick results with the workout. The teachers are fantasic and are willing to help you with poses. I love it there!~~#~1
OMG LADIES! I am HUGE on the bus.  I've been riding it to work for 2.5 years, and am horrified that you guys aren't pushing the benefits of commuting and mass transit in this city!I love Valley Metro. I ride the Rapid bus, every day, twice a day.  The rapid shuttle is part of Valley Metro, but it is a  very different bus line then the city buses that I think some of you have been riding on. There are 4 Rapid Routes...1 from the west valley, (I-10 west from Avondale) 1 from the north (I-17 from Bell Road) 1 from the East, (I-10 East from Chandler) and 1 servicing the 51, from the 51 and Shea.  If it were not for these rapid shuttles, I probably would not have a job, and probably have lost my mind by now. After I moved here, within 3 months, I had busted a windshield, had someone do a hit and run on me on the expressway, and basically sat in traffic for a ridiculous amt of time, so much that I was commuting an obnoxious amount of time.Finally, a fellow co-worker told me that she commutes in half the time from the same place using the bus. Since I started riding the rapid, I've been hooked.  My busses are on time, my commute is 1/3 of what I was doing when I was driving, and the amt of money I have saved on gas is unbelieveable.~~#~1
Everyone loves a good hot dog! Now, imagine that good hot dog wrapped in bacon, on Mexican style buns, oh my lord.. I'm getting excited.First of all, the Nogales Hot Dog cart is located on 20th st and Indian School in a random parking lot- don't let it deter you. Its nice and dark out there, so I enjoy going often in my pajamas.The standard hot dog is wrapped in bacon and served wit mayonnaise, tomatoes and pinto beans. On top, I generally add cojita cheese, a spicy green chile and mushrooms! YES! Mushrooms! They also have a guacamole type sauce, hot peppers and Mexican soda! They have everything!I would just like to say that I think that the service is outstanding. The men and women that run the cart are always so friendly and very helpful. They even gave my boyfriend a t-shirt once! You HAVE to try these hot dogs!~~#~1
A bunch of friends and I tried this place for my husband's birthday the other day after I found it here on Yelp.  For the love of everything tasty, this place was the BEST barbeque place I have ever been to (aside from a place I loved that went out of business in San Diego).  After reading all the reviews about the appetizers and entrees, I pretty much already knew what I wanted to order before even sitting down at our table.  Our waiter, Lorenzo, couldn't have been better with his service and sense of humor.  The feel of the interior was a mix of casual and modern yet not too overly countryfied...there weren't dead animals hanging on the walls staring at me as I ate or hides either.The group of us ordered the Onion Block for our appetizer.  I am not an onion person, but am a fan of the Bloomin' Onion at Outback.  But I can tell you right here and now that the Onion Block at BobbyQ's was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G-L-Y delicious!  It had the perfect crispy consistency, but what made it was the BBQ ketchup that it comes with.  I could have ate the sauce by itself.  The 6 of us ravaged it.  For our entree, my husband and I went for one of the winning combinations, particularly the BBQ chicken and prime rib.  We decided on the ranch beans and the Mac & Cheese (after the reviews) for our sides.  I went to ask for an order of corn bread (3 for $1.50) but Lorenzo told me that he would bring us a basket for all of us.  So, I am not sure if that is something that is included, kind of like chips and salsa at Mexican food joints.  The chicken was absolutely juicy and had the perfect amount of sauce and the prime rib was also juicy and melted in my mouth (we ordered it cooked Medium).  First, the Mac & Cheese was so very creamy and tasty that I had to stop myself from eating that and get back to the meat.  But the ranch beans tasted like so many others I have tasted, not bad though.  My friends and I, who also ordered the M&C, noticed a hint of jalapeno (not spicy, just the taste).  We asked Lorenzo and he told us they have two types of melted cheese in the kitchen, one being the cheese they usually use for the M&C and then this pepper jack/jalapeno cheese they use for other dishes.  He had said they must have accidentally used the wrong one and that it hadn't been the first time it happened.  This was so not a problem, b/c that jalapeno taste was actually what made it, I think.  I'll have to request it next time.  The desserts didn't impress me much, but I knew from the reviews, we'd be getting free donuts before we left.  I loved that touch!  Mark my words, we will be going back more than once.  I'm sure we will take our in-laws and my family to give them the chance to taste BobbyQ's deliciousness!!!!!~~#~1
Dismal, abject, revolting.  These are words one would use to describe the contents of a garbage can, or a snuff film. You know nice, pleasant things that one would enjoy on a Sunday afternoon. Shogun however deserves none of this high praise. These words are a lofty goal by their standards. I was so unfortunate to collide unwillingly with this place one Saturday for lunch and decided to order the unagi roll and the Panko Udon. I was expecting some common sense from the chef/wank they picked up off the street, but even hope fails occasionally in an explosion of misery. The unagi roll was horrible. The rice was not fully cooked, the contents were soggy and tasted old. The sushi would have been better if the chef had taken the ingredients, put them down his pants, sat on them for 5 minutes while riding a bull, and then vomited on the resulting creation. Later the Panko Udon arrived, and it was even worse. I understand that it was panko breaded and not a tempura batter, but still it was absolutely horrendous. They could not have overcooked the vegetables, shrimp, and fish more.  It was greasy, bland, insipid cooking that could not have been made better even if it were served with a diamond ring.  The store bought, cheap as you can find udon was undercooked and had the texture of noodles that had been sitting for about 30 minutes in a colander. These little beauties were served in a pool of horrific bottled tsuyu sauce that left a lingering chemical aftertaste that was just a delight to behold.I would not eat here again even if my scrotum were stapled to a chair and I was chained to a table. I have to give this place one star too many because Yelp unfortunately has a one star minimum. I would even rate any fast food chain better than this place. I have had better airline food.Cheers,Until then, get the beers in...Just not at Shogun.~~#~0
I can't get enough of this place. My boyfriend and I used to happily make the trek all the way from North Phoenix on a regular basis and have never been let down!Whenever I go out to eat in Tempe, specifically close to ASU, I expect half-ass service. I expect there to be hungover waitresses and hostesses texting when I walk up because in the past that's what I've come across. Though there are college students working at Republic Ramen, they have always been extremely helpful and have given us fantastic customer service despite the fact sometimes there's only one cashier/server at a time (usually during work hours on weekdays).What do I love most about the food at Repulic Ramen? The variety. There are several broth choices and they are happy to switch meat out for tofu. And the bowls are packed with tons of fresh veggies. I've seen a couple of complaints on here about the broth being bland - but I've never personally had that issue. Then again, I had a sh*t ton of Sriracha because it makes already phenomenal food taste THAT much better. Anyway, the bowls are huge. My boyfriend and I share one every time. And just in case we're hungrier than we thought, we always order a side of edamame or veggie tempura (if you go during happy hour it's like $1).But my favorite FAVORITE part of RR is their boba. On the other side of the dining room is a little cafe where they serve boba, sake, coffee, etc. I've lived in North Phoenix and now I live near Central Phoenix and boba is pretty hard to come by in those parts. I'd have to drive to Chandler or the West Valley and that just won't ever happen. I almost always order thai tea milk tea w/ boba but sometimes venture out and get a peanut butter & chocolate snow (creamy slushy) and my boyfriend likes to mix fruity flavors - they have a lot of options and you can mix any of them. Their boba pearls are always soft and they are generous with the amount they put in. I don't know about you, but I hate when I eat all the boba before I'm finished with the liquid. In this case, sometimes I find myself just eating boba pearls because I've already drank all the tea.All in all, this is probably my favorite restaurant. Does it feel like you're sitting down somewhere in Japan? No. It's definitely Tempe. It's very open and modern. But who cares because it's delicious. Fantastic food, friendly staff, clean bathrooms/tables/everything, lots of seating, and of course, boba!~~#~1
Ok you need a awesome party outfit this is the place to go!!! Looking for something different in your living room, bedroom, or office this place it amazing!! The prices are great too!~~#~1
After my experience at Papago Brewery, I now spend my time at Four Peaks any time I am in the mood for a good beer. I like their Arizona Peach Ale and their Hefeweizen. I usually order their veggie pesto pizza or chicken enchiladas. I know your probably thinking what I was thinking, enchiladas at a brewery? They are delicious. I always take home the leftovers, which are just as good the next day. My husband is predictable, he always orders the salmon b.l.t. Con - I wish Four Peaks had a better happy hour. Maybe 1/2 price appetizers, which would bring me in more often. Regardless, I still keep going back.~~#~1
I have heard about this palce before from some online... friends.... yeah, friends! *wink, wink* and they all claimed it was a nice spot to go and see the latest in fetish gear and whatnot.So I went and took a couple of friends and it was pretty awesome, I must admit! :) We went and tried on a few things and I was really surprised to see corsets and stuff in MY size!! I was jumping for joy as I purchased my totally cute denim corset with matching boyshort! :) We even found one for my male friend to wear to an upcoming event! :) The boots were KILLER!! OMG! I WANTED ALL OF THEM!! But alas, I didn't have the money for them all. BUT they can special order boots and are pretty cool about thing, so yeah - I'd definiatly go back the next time I'm hankering for a new nighte or corset of doom! }:D~~#~1
Oh, Chelsea's Kitchen, how I love thee. I don't usually wax on about restaurants, but I love everything about this place. It isn't fine dining, but the food is good and I'm always in a good mood as I walk up to the front door of this establishment. The service is always friendly, from the host at the door to every server or bartender I have ever dealt with there. I love the bar, whether I'm sitting on the inside or outside sections. If the weather is good, the patio tables are SO worth the wait. Last weekend, after a long morning run, Chelsea's Kitchen was our reward. As we sat, drinking our beers, we planned a future backyard filled with mesquite trees that provided a natural canopy of shade. Seriously, I could have sat there and drank all day. Come to think of it, I don't know why we didn't. Food-wise, I am a huge fan of the rib-eye tacos. Their burgers are are excellent, as well. You're not going to see a James Beard award associated with Chelsea's Kitchen. It's not that kind of place. The food is good and simple. The ambiance is casual and fun; nice enough for a business dinner, and casual enough for lunch with friends. I've never walked out of there anything but happy and will return again and again.~~#~1
I love going here and taking pictures.The last time I was there, I heard this beautiful flute music off in the distance.I followed it all thru the gardens, back and forth, thru all the winding paths, until I came upon this lil old dude sitting on a blanket with all these hand carved Native American Flutes laying about.Stayed a while, chilled and soaked up the ambience.A beautiful day for sure..~~#~1
Three words: Lobster Mashed Potatos!I love this place ! (When someone else picks up the tab!)~~#~1
I give the Loving Hut 5 stars mostly because of their Sweet and Sour Divine entree. It's like a mock sweet and sour chicken meal. I've visited the hut twice and although planned on trying something different on my second visit, ordered the Sweet and Sour once again. My matey enjoyed the Royal Noodle soup which was spicy, lemongrassy, and topped with plenty of cilantro. The service is friendly and the atmosphere is relaxing with a wall of windows spreading soft light throughout the interior. I noticed that a few people have complained about the religious video (possibly Buddhism? Didn't pay much attention) playing on the widescreen. I say who cares, no one is forcing you to convert to anything. From my experience throughout my lifetime almost everyone preaches something that they believe in one way or another. For me this was about the food, nothing else. Unless they are poisoning the food with some mind controlling substance, who cares!~~#~1
The picture are accurate.  This Penzey's location has a non-pretentious general store feel to it, and you can go inside and smell jars of each spice available.  My favorite is the China cinnamon.  It has such a wonderful scent.  I also liked how they had plenty of salt-free spices and almost any spice you can think of.  Make sure to pick up their catalog too!  Penzey's is one of those places that you can easily take for granted if you don't live near it, but if you love to cook, you need to stop inside!~~#~1
WOWZEEWOWWOW!!!!!  This place is nice.  This was the nicest and largest "regular" hotel room I've stayed in.  As I travel a little, I've stayed in several.  HUGE room, balcony with patio-table and 2 chairs, comfy, comfy, bed, a sofa and small sitting area, the standard desk, separate make-up area, small bar sink in the room, bathroom separated from room with a wall and small hallway.Super fast and friendly service from room service and housekeeping. ALL staff on the grounds were incredibly courteous. I can only imagine how much training must go into this- how do you get everyone from the bellman to the front desk staff to the coffee cart lady to the groundspeople to housekeeping to room service to ALL be friendly and professional????? I don't know, but this hotel has managed to do it. Hotel offers a shuttle that runs every hour on the hour to designated local Scottsdale destinations, but if you're really nice, the oh so cool bellman/shuttle driver will drop you where you want to go in Scottsdale (be sure to tip him well for that extra service!).The place is HUGE, and it's not all in one building.  It's sort of laid out like a sprawling apartment complex or maybe college campus.Watch the mini-bar prices, and room service add on charges. Nothing unusual, just the outlandish stuff all hotels charge.Overall, I have nothing to complain about. Nothing at all. The "WOW" factor is truly in effect here.~~#~1
VERY pleased with this great addition to downtown Phoenix entertainment options. Well curated indie film selection (thank you, Steve Weiss) and abundant showtimes.  It was so great to walk into the theater and find a generously sized screen, seats and legroom with options for sitting at hightops in back with friends to get bar service during the movie.  High quality picture and sound make movie viewing well worth the ticket price.  Tickets at $8 and a selection that's far more fascinating than the multiplexes.  They are mixing up the lineups which allows you to see a double feature or even a triple feature if you have the stamina (buying separate full price tickets for each screening).  Can't think of a more welcoming and enjoyable way to wait for the movie to begin than to lounge in the low lit cozy bar before or afterwards.  Thank you for the ample selection of themed snacks and drinks to match the themed films that are screening, what a wonderful and thoughtfu touch.  Ample parking, but better yet it's just a few blocks' walk southeast of the Roosevelt and Central light rail station, so leave the car at home altogether and make an adventure of it, perhaps by visiting the Public Market or one of the excellent bars and restaurants nearby.  Go to the filmbar often!! We are so lucky to have this jewel of a place in Phoenix.  Can't wait to return!~~#~1
CS, wow. Really hit them hard.I don't really disagree, cause I will never recommend this place or ever go back. There was a Dennis guy there who was a total turn off, I hope he doesn't own the place, but he did act like he did. Our Service was very old school, like where they did not care about you. They also didn't look happy to be there. News Flash, change your life.We were hungry, and that was the first place we saw, so we dipped in. Big mistake, it could of been the beginning of a horror movie.Next time Native New Yorker or Buffalo Wild Wings.~~#~0
This place was incredible. Took my In-Laws here for anniversary dinner while we were in AZ for a family wedding and they were more than pleased. While semi-exensive, the atmosphere is not too fancy or over the top, in fact it is classy and quaint. After reading other reviews, I saw that I should order the baked stuffed lobster and am I happy i did. It is one of their signature dishes and they do it right, it is very similar to lobster thermidor minus the heavy sauce. My wife had some turtle soup which was unique and tasty. (don't worry animal lovers, it was snapping turtle they used!)  FOr seafood in AZ, you need to visit Salt Cellar and view their wide array of fresh fish. Great wine selection too including local vino. Can't beat the experience and our waitress was over the top and spot on.~~#~1
Make sure to stop in if you are in the area. This place is incredible from the service to the product. I love their coffee so much and it is always in a new design of their coffee art. Its cool to have someone take the time to make a $3 latte instead of herding you in and out like Starbucks has become accustomed to. Money well spent! Free wifi too and make sure you grab a snickerdoodle cookie before you leave.~~#~1
FUN atmosphere, lots going on for a late dinner.  Food was really solid, I should have branched out more than the enchiladas, which were good regardless.~~#~1
We stayed here 4th of July weekend in one of their 2 bed/2.5 baths casitas. This "house" was the perfect size for our family of four. One room was a king room and the other had two queens. Each bedroom had its own bathroom, too. The casita was two floors with a rooftop deck, equipped with lounge chairs and patio table, kitchen (sink, fridge and microwave), dining room and living room with pull out bed. In addition to being close to the waterpark, we had smaller pools all around. The casita also had a carport which was a nice option. The rate we had provided free breakfast for two adults and kids 10 and under eat free at Lantana Grill. The breakfast buffet was extremely good. Hubby was ecstatic there was a lobby gift shoppe that made Starbucks drinks so iced nonfat caramel macchiatos were had all weekend long. The waterpark was fun but lawd it gets packed! The water slide was fun, lazy river always great, and mini golf is always fun, too. For kids 4 and up, they also have a half day camp that is nice for the adults that want a break. Since our littlest one is 3, I look forward to that next year! Although this is fun for families, I think this is also perfect for friends' getways. I can't wait to get the girlfriends together and spend the weekend drinking margaritas and lounging by the pools.~~#~1
Had the most amazing death by chocolate gelato here the other day. A must visit place for Gelato enthusiasts~~#~1
This place is rad! Some friends of ours took us here and I had no clue this type of food existed here in AZ. It was my first time having a Pasty and I got the Philly cheese steak pasty and it was awesome.  We had the peanut butter, banana and jelly pasty for dessert and it blew my mind. How this place has not opened more locations than a few I will never know. I can't wait to go back .~~#~1
I love autozone and they are helpful and I love the 43ave and Cactus location because its open 24 hours.~~#~1
Great place! Stayed here on a whim of flying toPhoenix ('coz the weather's good, compared to foggySan Francisco) in the middle of moving into a newhouse.We were pleasantly surprised of the pool staying openquite late. Also, they made killer mudslides poolside.Rooms were spacious and neutral, yet not boring. I'll definitely stay there again. Two thumbs way up!~~#~1
Wow! Dedicated rangers and great hiking. I do wish it wasn't so expensive but it is worth it!~~#~1
if you drink wine this is not the place to go . All four bottles I purchased were heated or in beer words Skunked I did notice tasty liquors were very cheapo will NEVER buy wine from this place~~#~0
Tish is absolutely the best.  The studio atmosphere is down-to-earth and mirror-free.  Tish provides great adjustments in class, and the music is always peaceful and at a reasonable volume.  You can really learn a lot from her classes regarding alignment and posture benefits, and you may even pick up a bit of Sanskrit (postures are announced in both English and Sanskrit).  In comparison to other studios in greater Phoenix, Hegel Yoga is the most reasonably priced that I have found.  It's a one-of-a-kind studio!  I highly recommend the Sivananda class - don't be scared by the name - it's a class that focuses on each of the body chakras.  And I also recommend the Ashtanga classes - Tish offers a student-friendly approach to Ashtanga where students are guided from posture to posture so there's no need to have the entire sequence memorized.  If that's not your style - check out the schedule of classes on Tish's website - there are classes for all levels and yoga interests.  Namaste.~~#~1
This place is not to be confused with PATSY Grimaldi's, which is in SCOTTSDALE, but also quite good. I think a lot of people come here thinking it is something else, and then get their panties in a bunch and whine because they're stupid and can't read.If you're looking for simple and delicious pizza and wings then you have found the place. This is one of the best classic pizza and wings joints I've been to, easily in my top three. The pizza is thin yet floppy, the toppings are great (try the sausage, it's sliced like pepperoni), the wings are crispy and the sauce is nice and hot... The food is just good. It is a full service place, I've never had any service issues there. The counter register is for take-out orders (duh) They have some good beers on tap too. I like to get a pitcher of Amber bock there with the folks when they're in town.If you're a coupon person, they are in the 2009 Entertainment book, very much worth it.The bottom line is that both Grimaldi's pizzas are outstanding, but know where you're going before you go there and complain.~~#~1
Good pizza is like good sex...after you've had it, you keep thinking about it, and you want more. Well, I had Grimaldi's pizza tonight and I keep thinking about it and I want more. This pizza is fabulous! The crust could not be more perfectly thin, crunchy on the bottom, and chewy on the top, and just overall stellar. The toppings were sublime.I sat at the bar, had a couple of cocktails and the best pizza I've had in forever. The bartender, was a great chic. She new how to be friendly and give great service without feeling forced or phony. I told her I had ridden my bike up there, so she offered to wrap up my extra pizza in tinfoil and put it in a plastic bag, so I could fit it in my basket. I had my purse, so a Styrofoam to go thing would have sucked. Styrofoam sucks anyway, but this would have been a space issue. Anyway, I love this place mucho, mucho.  Try it out to see what I am talking about.~~#~1
We have been shopping this Bashas since it opened, and it is probably my favorite of the grocers around here. The people are very helpful and friendly. They by FAR have the best meat around and have butchers on hand to get you exactly what you want! The produce is fresh and fairly priced and they have the BEST bread, rolls and donuts of ANY grocer in the valley. I have never had a bad experience here!~~#~1
Super friendly staff, great food and superb beers. Loved the cilantro lime hummus and nachos with pork, which I downed with a Devil's Ale and a Mr. Pineapple (seasonal), right after trying their 7x4oz brew sampler. I'm a fan now!~~#~1
Good healthy new place, and inexpensive.  A nice addition to downtown.  Love the nicely prepared vegetables (baby bok choy, and still nicely crunchy!), and the addition of fruit is nice.  And they added steamed tofu to the menu!  The shrimp with tomato is my favorite.~~#~1
Happened to stumble upon Los Taquitos while my hubby was getting his haircut at the salon next door. I had already eaten, so I grabbed a takeout menu to browse while checking the place out. Interior was very clean and i am a sucker for a place that has a chalkboard menu. (yah, I know)Tried it out about a week later because the menu is a la carte(big plus if you want authentic food that is not suffocated with cheese) and I was not disappointed! Ordered the shrimp burrito and a bowl of pozole. Husband got a green tamale and fish taco. The shrimp burrito had a delicious white sauce that  I couldn't get enough of.  Their pozole is red and comes with fresh cilantro, minced red onion, lettuce, and tortillas on the side. The broth was flavorful and the pork super tender.  It even had just a slight oiliness on the top from the pork fat that I recognize as authentic pozole. Everything was EXCELLENT and came out piping hot .(not on a heated plate!)  I am going back tonight for some more!~~#~1
I had to travel all the way to Phoenix for some good fried chicken!!  After a super hot day of walking through the Botanical Gardens, the only thing that got me through was thinking about checking out Lo-Lo's and the let me tell you that they didn't disappoint!  The place was packed at 5pm but we luckily got in super fast.  Our table tried a little bit of everything.  The Chicken and Waffles, Fried Catfish, Fried Redfish, Collard Greens, and the Gizzards.  Let me start with my favorite, the fried chicken.  Delicious!!  Perfectly seasoned and crispy.  It's hard to find a place where they put the right seasonings in the fried chicken, but Lo-Lo's got it just right.   A great balance of seasoning to give the chicken some zing and super crispy.  The catfish was great, with a similar seasoning.  Nice big filets and not greasy at all, same goes for the redfish.  The redfish was like a southern version of fish and chips.  I'm not a fan of gizzards, but Lo-Lo's got it right so that they were tender instead of rubbery and how can it fail smothered with gravy?  Let's also not forget the waffle, damn that thing was good, with some cinnamon or something in the batter so that it was just a good without the syrup.  I'm also an unsweetened tea kind of girl now, but Lo-Lo's brought back memories with their sweetened tea in big mason jars, just perfect.The service was great as well.  Enjoy the ambiance b/c it was authentic and the people that waited on us were awesome.I'll be making Lo-Lo's a permanent stop on all my trips back to Phoenix!!~~#~1
Arby's is an old favorite. The market fresh sandwiches are awesome. But it's their curly fries that bring me back. If you want something different for fast food not the same old burger joint give this place a try.~~#~1
Superb service. Great value. Wonderful sandwiches! We bought the most expensive sandwich on the menu and my wife and I had to split it because it was so big. I think the whole dinner including drinks was like $12.00 or something. We loved the food. The French bread is so good it reminded me of my time in Louisiana. Everybody was friendly and helpful. LOVE LOVE LOVE!~~#~1
I wish I had known this was closed as well. We camped out near here and thought would be a great photo opportunity- Alas, the gates were closed, the signs were hung- and the fence was BARBED.  First time I had seriously considered trespassing- it looked like such a great spot for old timey photos, was tough to resist!~~#~0
The husband and I love this place. We have been coming here ever since we moved to the neighborhood and both the food and service is consistently amazing. We have tried most of the breakfast menu but haven't dived into the lunch menu. Our favorite is the Gouda brizza (breakfast pizza) - smoked gouda, bacon, hollandaise sauce, and scrambled eggs. Yum! On lazy weekends, we order this to go and enjoy back at our place. When we dine in, it's a mix. Their Costa breakfast burrito is delicious - something the husband orders frequently. I really like their mushroom and bacon omelet, but I also enjoy their "two eggs anyway" meal. I normally get scrambled eggs, bacon, pancakes, and fruit (instead of potatoes). Super delicious and filling. Another favorite are the Biscuits and Gravy. Now this is amazing! The biscuits are super soft on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside. They just melt in your mouth! The gravy is the perfect accompaniment. It's thick and filled with sausage. These are some of the best B&Gs I've had! The best part is how inexpensive yet utterly delicious they are! I love that it's a local place that uses local food. Everything is fresh and the staff is outstanding. We've taken both sets of parents here as well as friends. This is definitely the go-to breakfast place. If you are ever in the area, you should definitely check it out!~~#~1
Tammie Coe... Will you marry my chocolate addiction??? WOW is all I can say about the "Milk chocolate and hazelnut cake" it is truly a chocolate lovers paradise on a chocolate island full of love. From the first bite, to the last, I was just wanting more. I'm not into frivolous girlie looking things. This cake is VERY decorated. When I first saw it, I thought to my self, oh sweet baby, what has my family gotten me into here, and where is MY dessert??? UNTIL I saw it being cut, and some chocolatey goodness came out with the cake, I thought to myself, lets wait and see what this thing is all about. Well... IT WAS AMAZING! I WANT MOREEEEEEEE. LOVED IT!!~~#~1
Good Food, Great Prices... HUGE PORTIONS!!!  you are buying lunch and dinner when you go... and you have to have the cookie skillet!!!~~#~1
Back to Blue Fin for the nth visit, but the first visit for 2011!  Same great service, same good food, and same affordable prices.  Had my usual order:Terriyaki bowl - YUMFried Gyoza - HUMGreen Ice Tea - AHH~~#~1
great food, great prices, and fast.have been going for 4 years.   yummy !!!~~#~1
Although this Market is named after a WNBA team, don't knock it. This place gets super busy, but you won't find a Black Friday type of line here no matter how busy it gets because there is plenty of indoor seating and some outdoor seating. Also, there is always someone monitoring the order line to make sure you will have a place to sit. The service here is top notch, everyone smiles and makes sure you are taken care of. If you come with someone, I highly suggest splitting your entrees so you can get a variety of tastes. If you are pizza-ophile, you should definitely try the WHITE pizza...which has parmesean sauce, grilled chicken, arugula, pine nuts and smoked mozzarella...it usually comes with chopped bacon but we got it without. This pizza is quite filling and if you want something that wont weight you down like kim kardashian's backside, then i highly suggest the good ole Margherita pizza, which comes mozarella and basil. It's pretty basic, but it doesn't really matter how simple food is as long as the ingredients are fresh and it tastes good. I've also had their Best Chicken Sandwich, which is grilled chicken, spicy avacodo, monterrey jack cheese, tomato and chipotle vinagarette. There is a lot going on in this sandwich, but it came together pretty well. This is one of those sandwiches where you eat the first 50% and you're like, "wow this is really good,i wont dare share this with anyone." But then when i got to the last 15%, I was like, "eh, you started out really good, but i'm kinda over you." aka the chris brown effect. Great atmosphere, great value for your buck, and overall perfect place for a weekend lunch.~~#~1
I'm with Kirstin E. - the Betty Boop is the way to go!  My office is *almost* within walking distance and I'd eat here every day if I didn't require a nap after doing so.  This place is a Phoenix institution....I looooves it!~~#~1
Love Love Love this store!  Great furniture and Great Service.  Dennis the owner is so accomodating.  We have bought several items from this store and we tell all of our friends and family out this place.~~#~1
I love it here! Their sizzling tofu dish is awesome, and you usually get enough for three meals. Lots of veggie options, and my husband loves their orange chicken (as did I when I used to eat chicken). Ask for it spicy -- it's delish!~~#~1
After 10yrs in the Valley, I finally found this Little hidden Gem. I honestly have to say its was the best Jewish deli I've been to. No more Subway when I'm craving a sandwich...Its close to the Biltmore area, which is a huge plus for me because its close to home. Just like any Deli its seat yourself type of place with a deli counter for your to-go orders. I luv this spot!!Food: 5 STARSI ordered the Pastrami on garlic bread. It had a huge portion of meat covered with Swiss chesse and grilled onions. It also came with homemade fry's and coleslaw. I was very impressed with the size of the meal. IT WAS AMAZING!!!!Not only do they serve sandwiches, but they had a huge menu from breakfast to entrees. Everything that passed by our table looked great.SERVICE: 5 STARSFrom the moment we walked in ..we were welcomed with a friendly greet...to the moment we were leaving they made sure everything was perfect.Location: 5 STARScentrally located in the valley in a nice shopping complex. Next to Ace Hardware.PRICE: 4 STARS $12.50 for Huge Pastrami Sandwich/ Fries/ coleslaw. It was a big portion, but just a tad pricey for lunch price. Take $2.50 off and it would of been a 5 too.I def will be back all the time with friends and family regardless your pricing... Thank you for the Great Lunch.~~#~1
For an airport restaurant, this place is great! I was so pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and the service that I have since decided that I no longer hate this airport.I was promptly seated and showed where an outlet was under my table, should I need it. Nice!My waitress was SO friendly and helpful and was actually enthusiastic about the food. She also asked if I preferred sweet or not so sweet cocktails and gave me food suggestions. I seriously couldn't believe I was in an airport as she described the marination process of the shrimp.  The drinks were great and the food was actually mighty tasty. The guac was fresh: sprinkled with cotija and cilantro, and the chips house-made. The shrimp chopped salad was bursting with different flavors and a really good-sized portion. I was super-stuffed by the end of the meal. Also, they let me hang out there for three hours and did not once rush me or pressure me to leave.So if you have to eat in the Phoenix airport, go here, seriously.(Terminal 4 - A gates)~~#~1
St Francis is ok with you asking to move chairs around to be next to your loverAnd after you are done smoochin'Order Order Order the Pot Roast Sandwich (real Texas toast) - this is after you sip on the Dark & Stormy and share the Romaine Hearts AppetizerAsk for recommendations the wait staff (which are all very handsome) will be glad to lead you in the right direction. Yum Yum Yum~~#~1
I have been going to Scramble for 2 years- I can't believe I have not reviewed it yet! I love the casual atmosphere of this place and I love the outside patio when the weather is cooperating. The service is great and the food is even better. They are open for breakfast and lunch. The menu is varied- breakfast pizza's, salads, sandwiches, benedicts etc...My husband loves the gringo burrito. My son loves the eggs benedict and I usually create my meal from the al la carte menu. Try the cinnamon roll....you won't regret it!~~#~1
What's not to like about ice cream (unless you have a lactose allergy, of course!).  The inside is adorable and it offers a ton of ice cream options, so there's something for everyone.  Great staff here as well...our server was fabulous!  To the reviewers complaining about cleanliness...I have a bit of OCD--especially at restaurants.  Was the bathroom the cleanest/nicest I've ever used?  No--I would say more "old" than "dirty", but at least it worked and had soap (ever been to a restaurant where there's no soap in the bathroom...how gross.).  I didn't notice any crumbs on the floor or on seat cushions...In my opinion though, I'd rather have crumbs on the floor than have someone sweeping or vacuuming next to me while I'm trying to eat.~~#~1
12 bucks, 10 minutes, old school, looks great!~~#~1
My ABSOLUTE favorite.Came all the way from LA CA just to have some delicious breakfast.~~#~1
Good food, good atmosphere too ... Kids love the grill and the the fellas who cook and keep you laughing are great ... I have been there atleast 4 times and plan on returning ... JL~~#~1
The Books! The furniture! The dishes! The jewelry in the Fancy Stuff case!  Expensive designer shoes and ladies bags - expensive until they hit Flo'sItems from all these departments and more are in our home. This place is a bag of candy for a Thrift Store book addict. I've found lots of nice old literary and children's books, guitar playing instruction books with rock music chords and words and original compositions folded inside. Sweet D perches in front of her computer on a chair that probably began its life in an attorney's office. People drop off some interesting and classy plates, cups, dishes, dish sets, coffee and tea pots, plus shot glasses! We found Black Hills Gold earrings for a fraction of their retail or EBay price.   They were caked in shoe polish, roof patch, or some other gunk and we got lucky. We almost had to stop going. But we can't resist. Because we know we are buying the Stuff Holding Together the Universe as We Know It. If we don't clutter up our museum, I mean house with the right stuff, it may go to the dump, decompose, and chaos ensue. Besides that, Flo's is for helping young women who've fallen on The Worst of Times. And that is worthy.~~#~1
HUGE MISTAKE.  My husband seemed to be coming down with something - and we were too busy for him to get sick.  I called Doctors Express to find out how much it would be for him to come in.  They told me that it was the cost of an urgent care visit - per my insurance card.  I asked if I could make an appointment, they said "no need."  Since my Blue Cross card doesn't mention the cost for urgent care, I called Blue Cross - who told me $50.  My husband went.  They did nothing - he was probably just exhausted (and now also annoyed by his wife who talked him into going to see a doctor for nothing).  Two months later, I received a bill for over $200.  HUGE MISTAKE.  I anticipate the telephone argument, then a call to the AG, then seeing if there is a class action suit in process for others in my position .... now I am the one exhausted.  Again, HUGE MISTAKE.~~#~0
Wow!!! This is the best ice cream I have ever had - seriously, folks, this place shows Sweet Republic who's boss.  The ice cream is rich and creamy and full of flavor.  I tried the butter pecan, banana, peanut butter and chocolate.   The chocolate was unlike any chocolate ice cream I have had before - you could actually taste the coco flavor and it was more satisfying than a sugar loaded Hershey's concoction.  Bonus - they have pretzel cones!! This went especially well with scoops of chocolate and peanut butter! Yum!!I hopped on the froyo train for awhile there, but this place is going to cause me to derail and get fat.  Oh well.  I'll be happy. The interior is a very cute, old-school ice cream parlor.  It reminded me of Smeeks.  There was not seating inside, but about 5 tables outside.  They also have lots of retro candies and freshly baked cookies and complimentary water in a jug (flavored with lavender and lemon).I've already forgotten that Mary Coyle's is closing down...~~#~1
Amazing flavors, unique ambiance, and friendly staff. What else can you ask for? Oh yes...it's better than Starbucks!  Their menu ranges from your regular boba flavors to the unique Patbingsu plate (Korean ice shaved desert with all kinds of yummy toppings like, red beans, tiny marshmellow rice cakes, kiwis, cherries and more, topped with syrup/milk).  I am too lazy to make daily trips since I live in NE Mesa but this place is wonderful...I go at least once a week but always miss it.~~#~1
This place is chaotic, confusing, and the people who work here are just plain mean.  Hands down, it is the worst airport I have ever been to.~~#~0
This place is Great!  The food is freshly cooked to order and the portions are big enough that 2 people could share a meal.  The crab ran-goon is amazing.  The atmosphere is pleasant enough that it suites as an any type occasion restaurant.  It is also family friendly and any dress code will work.  They have a very large menu to select from along with foreign beer and wines.  If you enjoy wine their plum wine is a winner.  This is by far my favorite Chinese/Asian restaurant in the area.  The prices are also as friendly as the staff.~~#~1
I was very impressed by this place! I am not a Vegetarian and I always get a little wary about places that are solely vegetarian, but I had looked at the Yelp reviews on this place, and it was within walking distance of my hotel, so I decided to give it a try.I was definitely not disappointed. The place is very welcoming in an ethereal sort of way. It is a mostly college crowd predictably but there were other in the restaurant as well. I spoke with the young lady (her name escapes me now) at the counter who was very friendly and knowledgeable. I told her truthfully that I was not a vegetarian and did she have any suggestions. At her direction, I tried the crab puffs and the Thai peanut bowl with mock chicken. I walked it back to my hotel.All I can say is.....WOW! The mock chicken tasted like..... well,..... CHICKEN! Great chicken actually. I don't really go for straight tofu and the vegetarian god who prepared this must have known it. I did not miss the chicken. The Thai peanut bowl was quite spicy and delicious. The crab puffs were very good, a little greasy, and not as good as the real thing, but well worth it, and if I am here again I will probably have them again. Way to go! If many vegetarian restaurants are this good, then Jeff might have to rethink his avoidance of these places.~~#~1
Super clean!!!~~#~1
Father's Day marked my third visit to St. Francis.  I haven't been disappointed yet.  Some reviewers complain the menu is small, but the menu changes constantly, as St. Francis uses fresh, local ingredients--exactly why I love it.The St. Francis Meyer Lemonade is a lovely way to start off the evening.  I had mine made with honey-infused vodka.  Then, you're brought fresh-baked bread and olive oil for dipping.  I've had few of their salads, the one with green goddess dressing is divine (the veggies on it were different both times), the buttermilk-dressing salad was fine as well, though less memorable.  The roast chicken has been my favorite entree there, with the hangar steak being a close second.Whatever you do, save room for dessert.  I don't normally order dessert out.  The first time I ate there, however, the server offered us a free dessert, because the kitchen forgot to put our mushroom sauce on the side.  Too full to eat it that night, I ordered a rhubarb-berry galette with almond creme fraiche to go.  The next day, I took a nibble from the edge.  Oh, wow.  I ate the whole thing right there, standing in front of the fridge.  I was sold, and made it a point to eat dessert there every visit. Of the desserts I've tried (chocolate cake with peanut butter gelato and caramel corn, that infamous galette, and some architectural creation with blackberries and mascarpone), the best, hands down, is the sticky toffee pudding.  I've had it twice now--each time it was a little different, both times my dining companions and I battled for the last bite.Sure, the building is cool, the brick oven is neat, the place is trendy, but it's a restaurant.  The food should be the priority.  For those of us really, REALLY into beautifully combined, high-quality, fresh ingredients, St. Francis is heaven.~~#~1
Manuels was very disappointing.  I ordered taquitos, and it tasted like they were the frozen and just warmed in the oven.  I could bought the same ones at the local grocery store.  Same can be said with the salsa.  It tasted like jar salsa.  It should have been obvious from the lack of cars in the parking lot, on a Friday evening.  The 80's music also did not  fit the atmosphere of a Mexican restaurant.~~#~0
Big, clean and losts of stores ranging from $ (Forever21, Charlotte Russe, Wet Seal ect.) to $$$$$$$$$$ (Louis Vuitton, Ralph Lauren, Barneys ect.) The food court also has a wide range of options, it's a fun place to go, especially if you're from out of town!~~#~1
It was ok once everything was resolved but I wish the staff were more professional and attentive. The hotel has such an odd layout (that pool is strange) so I only used this place to sleep/shower. The place should be redecorated and refurbished ASAP. Until that happens, I will be staying elsewhere.~~#~0

I have been going to Windsor since they opened.  I don't know why it is just now that I am writing this review.  This place does not, and never has, disappoint.  Just like Postinos they have the same drink special, $5 pitchers, special cocktails, and glass of wine before 5pm, but their menu is more extensive.The menu is always changing, but some staples you will want to try are - Kale Salad (chopped or Caesar), Windsor Burger (if you get fries ask for the Gold Sauce for dipping), Ceviche, whichever platter they have in the starters, and the Pastrami Reuben.  When you are adding sides I would suggest the Jo's Church Potatoes (it is like hash browns mixed with mac and cheese), the Mac N' Cheese is great, and I am a fan of the Fried Okra.Finish or start any of these with a pitcher, cocktail, or glass of wine and you will leave with a smile.  The Tape Wall is definitely worth checking out if you have never been here, it will bring back memories if you remember what tapes are.  Thank you Windsor.~~#~1
All I can say is yuck. My friend and I came here for a roller derby match tonight and it was so disappointing. The good was that the place was packed for the match. The bad? Let me count the ways. The straight out of the 80's building design and decor was the first bad sign. Then as you begin to enter the building, you feel as though you are entering a dungeon. But again, with so many people there, you think there has got to be some redeeming qualities. We get inside and get some food in the "snack bar." As we waited in line, I looked around and was too terrified to touch anything. Outdated furnishings and pieces that looked as though they couldn't be cleaned if you wanted to. I bought a bottle water, soft pretzel, and order of fries. Total was $6 which I thought to be very reasonable. The girl told me 3 min on the pretzel and fries. I got the pretzel in 3 min and the fries in 15 min. I was so pissed since the match started by then. When I finally got my food, we went to find seats. That was a total joke. There were folded chairs on the rink floor in addition to the seats on the outside of the rink. Every seat was filled and people standing everywhere. So apparently buying a ticket does not guarantee you a seat. Ridiculous. The match was just okay. I thought there would be more action but how much can there be when fans are sitting on the actual site of the match?  We didn't stay for the second match, after all, who wants to stand the whole time? My advice? Have low, low expectations before coming here and it shall not disappoint.~~#~0
Authentic Brooklyn style pizza is what Grimadli's is all about.  I actually don't have a comparison to Brooklyn pizza, but it is pretty darn good.  When you arrive, expect to have at least a 30 minute wait, if not longer.  The great thing is that they give a buzzer that looks like a pizza, so you can walk around nearby in Old Town or hit up a bar.If you plan on eating an entire pizza, expect to have at least 3-4 people helping you.  Their slices are huge.  We got a pizza with red marinara sauce base along with onions, olives, and bell peppers.  The pizza came in about 20 minutes and it smelled incredible.  The pizza had a thin crust but a hearty taste.  The pizza size is enormous, so don't be thinking its a light pizza just because it is thin.The service was fantastic even with a busy audience.  I would come here again with a small group of people and enjoy some pizza.~~#~1
Having moved to the area a couple months ago, my wife and i decided to check out one of the neighborhood eateries.  tonight we chose tott's.we read some of the reviews here on yelp, and they could not be more accurate.  we both thoroughly enjoyed our respective dishes and took advantage of their 2 meals for $20 deal.  1 appetizer, 2 drinks, 2 entrees and 1 desert for $20.  the staff was friendly and the restaurant was clean and small but cozy.  there was a constant stream of people coming in for take-out.  the appetizer was 3 nicely cooked spring rolls that weren't greasy and perfectly cooked inside.  they came with a sweet & sour dipping sauce that complemented the spring rolls nicely.  my wife ordered the hong kong stir fry with chicken (sans the mushrooms) and i ordered the orange chicken (their most popular dish).  the portions are large...enough for 2 meals.  the hong kong stir fry was delicious.  the chicken was white meat and cooked well and no 'strange parts' like you sometimes find in stir fry.  the veggies were big chunks and cooked just right...not soggy and not crisp.  the orange chicken was wonderful also.  it had a spicy kick that built as you ate more.  the sweetness from the citrus evened the spiciness out for the most part, combining for a tasty balance.  both came with large portions of rice.  for dessert we ordered the almond cheesecake.  a perfect ending to our meal.  it was light and fluffy with a graham cracker crust that had almonds in the crust.  tott's provided a great experience with great service and tasty food.   a local restaurant that we will definitely go to again.~~#~1
We LOVE Malee's on Main.  We go there every weekend.  We got my parents addicted, too.  My dad loves the Crab Rangoon.  My husband likes the Crispy Basil Chicken and Exotic Fried Rice.  I always get the Arizona Heatwave (made vegan), but I also like the Cashew Chicken made vegetarian.  They're incredibly accommodating.  The mango sticky rice is WONDERFUL!!!~~#~1
I'm gay for their Vanilla wafer cookies and cream and cheesecake bites. OMG~~#~1
Love their chicken & waffles!!  We ate there for dinner one evening...  We could not get enough, came back the following week for lunch.  Just speaking of chicken & waffles, I need to make a visit again SOON!!~~#~1
Above and beyond the type of service you'd expect, friendly personel and Zack helped me out of a real bind. Thank you all for your great service and since finding out you are closed on Sundays I want a job! : )~~#~1
Ok. So I'm not big on dining in large corporate style restaurants. I usually find the food to be mediocre. Service to be fake. Mgmt to be poor.But...We were desperate to find a place to eat in Chandler on a Monday night being that most of the small biz restaurants are closed Sundays and Mondays...so after driving around for 30 minutes we decided to give this place a try.We walked in greeted by a friendly hostess. Seated and greeted under a minute literally; and we were even more pleased to find that on Monday nights they offer half off all wines (except the reserve list).Our server Dan was THE BEST Server!!!  Very friendly, informative, and knowledgeable.  You can sense that he cares to be at work.  Management seemed to be just as caring. They noticed we needed a box for our food so instead of telling Dan or the busser to get it for us they handed it themselves.  (I can't stand it when I see managers in restaurants pointing fingers here and there)The food was delicious too.  My husband had the prime rib and I had the cheeseburger (i know, cliche, but i was craving one) and we shared a bottle of Stags Leap Petite Syrah for half price!! Couldn't make it for dessert but maybe next time.I will definitely return and hope to be seated in Dan's section!~~#~1
I spend too much money at Changing Hands.  I love the tea pots, the Annie Taintor garb, and most of all the books.  Shopping here makes me feel good about myself and the "You're supporting a local business.  Go you!"-esque signs add to my smug sense of satisfaction.Beyond that, this place is just cool.  Between book readings, story time, and book clubs, there's always something wonderful going on.  The stamp cards are helpful for those of us addicted and the selection never fails to impress.High-five, Changing Hands.~~#~1
I think I'm addicted.  It's got three awesome attributes: it's authentic, it's good, and it's cheap.  99 cent street tacos and the 2.99 gordito are amazing.  It looks like a greasy spoon outside, but inside this small joint is clean and friendly.   I've now gone back 4 times in the past 4 weeks.~~#~1
Love coming here! The pizza is great, all the ingredients taste fresh and delicious. The wine pairings are awesome and the service is wonderful. I really don't have a single bad thing to say about it. Go try it out, I'm sure once you do it will become a part of your regular date night rotation.~~#~1
Hands-down, the best stuffed French Toast I've ever had! The cinnamon swirl bread was soft and thick, sliced in half (could only finish half- hello breakfast for lunch!). Flowing from the center was the most delicious vanilla cream cheese filling, and the bananas foster on top was just the icing on the cake! It came with some protein to balance out the carb fiesta-- bacon, yummy & crispy! The server was friendly, and of course I got seated right away (10:30am on a Monday morning). She kept kept my iced tea filled without me ever having to ask, and even knew to give me one to-go!The overall feeling of the Wy-Knot Cafe is relaxed and has a really good vibe. From the colorful, almost dreamy paintings on the wall to the dog-friendliness (pictures of Wyatt everywhere), it just made me feel happy being there. I also liked the variety of seating options and the spaciousness of having two rooms.This, my friends, is what makes me love breakfast so much! And I can't wait to go back for lunch (and of course breakfast)!~~#~1
Ruined several of my shirts, extremely overpriced, unhelpful employees... This place is on my black-list...If you are going to use them DO NOT, i repeat, DO NOT do what they call 'fluff and fold', it's what they told me was the same as Wash/Fold laundry at other places....What it turned out to be was wash, with no fold... the folding was amateur, and that means a lot coming from someone who pays to get things folded for him haha! Plus it was expensive as shit! One of the things I miss most about SF is chinese wash/fold, it is amazing there...~~#~0
I was out with the boyfriend for First Friday, and was desiring something cool, sweet, and creamy. My first thought is always Gelato. We were strolling, and came across Chill Out. When we walked in, it seemed clean, and the purveyors were quiet, yet smiling and friendly. I ordered a large Lemon. The price wasn't terrible, but the flavor bordered on it. The consistency was like that of Gelato that had gone through a few thaw-freeze cycles, and was gummy. The texture was really gross because of this, and the flavor was pretty bland. I've had better Gelato out of the freezer aisle at my local grocery. I wouldn't drive out of my way, or even stop in when walking by, to eat this Gelato.~~#~0
One of my favorite features of the Salt Cellar is the wide range of seafood they offer. I recently had the Alaskan Halibut Cheeks, which I have never seen on any other menu here in the desert of Phoenix....these cheeks were unbelievably amazing. They also were featuring a special for the month of August called a "Clam Bake", included a dozen steamed clams, one pound and a quarter lobster and an ice cold draft beer PLUS veggies, a side salad and baked potato... ALL of that goodness for $45... does it get any better that that? I don't think so. As a pretty serious "yelper" and foodie, I once again recommend this place to anyone out there who loves great seafood, outstanding service and unique atmosphere. You really can't go wrong. Go for it seafood lovers!~~#~1
Five stars for my fire-roasted veggie tacos.Zero stars for the heat. My god, Arizona is Satan country.~~#~1
Super good. Great for birthdays and big groups.~~#~1
Love this place!Went during lunch with my colleagues so could not try off their wine/liquor list but the food and decor did not fail us.We sat outside and enjoyed a nice spring day in Arizona. Pre-summer so able to enjoy lunch without the heat.I ordered their mix greens salad with chicken; the greens were fresh and the chicken was seared to perfection. My company both ordered sandwich combos (chicken salad and tuna melt) and both said it was really good.I will definitely be returning and hopefully check out their happy hour that is 11 am - 6 pm daily - can't beat that!~~#~1
The food was delicious. I had the carne asada burrito with sour. cream, guacamole and cheese. The other people I was there with got the carnitas and there was no complaints there either.~~#~1
This is the quintessential Mexican restaurant if you live in Topeka, Kansas, or South Bend, Indiana, and don't know what Mexican food is.  Bland, bland, bland.  Let's begin with the ridiculous up-charges.  $1.95 for chips and flavorless salsa that reminds me of tomato paste.  If you want some salsa with flavor, you can get the tomatillo salsa  . . . for an additional $1.95.  Dear restaurateur: chips and salsa are free at real Mexican food restaurants.  $3.50 for three very small corn tortillas.  Guacamole is a Mexican food favorite, so you better offer it, and it had better be good.  We paid $8 for guacamole that rivaled generic grocery store brands for flavor.  Luckily, I could add the overpriced tomatillo salsa to give it some zest.  I don't know if the guacamole doesn't usually come with chips, but they charged me for the aforementioned chips/salsa even though you'd think the chips were part of the guacamole feast.  The borracho beans were something like $3.50 and amounted to perhaps five spoonfuls of beans.  On the bright (ok--the "not horrible" side), my fiancee had a cheese quesadilla that wasn't bad.  This is the food equivalent of Gilbert Ortega jewelery stores.  Tourists will want to stop by to have some of the 100+ tequilas and to say they ate Mexican food when they visited Arizona.  The rest of us who know about Barrio Cafe, Los Dos Molinas, etc., will want to avoid it.~~#~0
Excellent service and food.~~#~1
Lola embodies what supporting local businesses is all about! They have put together a first rate business that consistently serves GREAT coffee and offers a fine selection of pastries.The atmosphere is awesome with large windows facing the street that let in plenty of sunlight. Awesome tunes are always playing and I particularly dig the retro stereo. I always pop in just before work so I have yet to spend time and soak up the atmosphere, but this is a local business that Phoenix can be proud of.~~#~1
Another location, another ode to ChipotleBurrito, burrito bowl, quesadilla, or tacoBarbacoa, steak, carnitas, chicken, or veggieBlack beans or pinto beansSpicy, corn, medium, pico de gallo, or a mixtureSomething for the whole family. Instead of yellowed Spanish riceActual white Mexican-style rice with a hint of cilantro and limeAnd. . .Brown rice for the health consciousSomething for everyone.How come it's soooooo good!?Tin foil, talkative cups, and gregarious wrappersWhat's up with the narcissistic pictures?Lots of metal and woodYou know when you walk into a ChipotleThere is always a Chipotle near by, but. . .Why aren't there more Chipotles!?~~#~1
This is the best record store I have ever been to. The staff knows so much about so many different types of music and they are always willing to help you find what you need. If you tell the staff what style of music you are looking for they will help you find tons of options,and then other options that you would probably want after you listened to whatever you buy.  I am not a DIY music consumer so i depend on this place for ideas on how to grow my library. These people care about music and it always really shows.~~#~1
Worst place I've been to in az.. We went to a d backs game very recently and were early so decided to have few drinks and bite to eat before at sliders. I can't say we were completely disappointed because watching the staff was actually entertaining nobody knew what was going on or from the looks of it could read either. We were first seated upstairs and nobody came to table for 15+ min so we walked over to bar. Despite horrible food reviews we ordered sampler platter with sliders mini dogs and pulled pork, don't make same mistake we did. We assumed maybe people had too high of expectations, not at all I would consider food barely edible I wouldn't even feed it to my dog. If wasn't for our bartender I would of gave it a zero if it is possible. No draft beers I'll equipped bars/bartenders I will never come back here and try to keep people from making same mistake we did. There are few places with couple blocks worth walking to.~~#~0
Einstein's is Noah's Bagels in SFThey're the same!Who knew!?Anyways,I like the manager of this location.  He's always so friendly and seems genuinely happy to be there and talkin' with his customers.I am obsessed with the jalapeno salsa cream cheese.  I literally buy 3 tubs of it everytime I go there.My favorite items includeSanta Fe bagel sandwich (jalapeno salsa cream cheese, turkey sausage, eggs, pepperjack cheese and salsa! YUM)Pepperoni pizza bagelAND.  They have Mr Pibb on tap.  I love Mr. Pibb.  Don't know why, I just do.~~#~1
Never been to a Dunkin' Donuts, and I swear we use to have some here in Orange County, but I've had the coffee.It truly is the best I have ever tasted. The donuts...I have no idea.How's that for forbidden love?~~#~1
This place is the definition of a mom and pop restaurant. Their whole family runs this place. They are very friendly and accommodating, they will take care you. Plus this is the only Polish food I've been able to locate, aside from Stanley's who specilizes in sausages. The restaurant is located on a quiet street in Downtown Glendale. There is a patio with trees towering overhead. It makes for a very peaceful lunch, and for a moment almost makes you forget you're in a blistering desert. They do have limited hours so make sure you call ahead of time. I have been here twice, and both times were excellent. My friend's mom (who is Polish) made me Pierogi when I was young, and ever since I've been hooked. I had both the potato and cheese and the meat Pierogi. Altough I prefer a little more butter and onion with my Pierogi they were still delicious and cooked perfectly. Next, I had to Golabki (stuffed cabbage) which was even better than the Pierogi. They were moist and filled with plenty of flavorful meat, and topped with a sweet and tangy tomato sauce. The Goulash is also amazing, but I can't go into detail on this one since I had it on my first visit. I highly recommend A Touch of European Cafe. I wish I didn't live so far from this place! Its rare that I get to fulfill my Polish cravings.~~#~1
In my athletic career I've had the opportunity to work with Olympic Trainers and Nutritionists......they have nothing on Robert at Spartan Training!  He has mastery knowledge in all aspects of fitness and nutrition.  He and his wife Vicki take the time to explain what's actually happening in your body during exercise and how nutrition plays it's role.  I have personally never seen the results I've had with Robert this quickly.  Its been a long time since I've felt this good! As a Paralympic Gold medalist, I highly recommend Spartan Training!Thank you Robert and the rest of the Spartan Training team for all your efforts!~~#~1
So after reading Laura L's review I was scared to go to NOCA since the executive chef left as her review was so bad.  I still had faith though that a place this caliber wouldn't go downhill that fast with the rest of the cooks still there.  I had the chef tasting menu and it was up there with the top meals I have ever had and the experience was amazing.  Palate cleanser:  Toasted nuts, raspberries, cheese and balsamic reductionAppetizer: (upgraded)Lobster roll - So amazing I will be back on a Wednesday just to eat this againSecondi:Hand Cut Pasta with brown butter and FennelEntree:Veal Scallopini-  This was perfectly cooked and the presentation was amazingDessert:Cotton CandyPassion Fruit and CoconutI also paired the meal with the wine accompanies which all were great except the dessert wine didn't really pair with the dessert I got but after I finished it and had a few minutes it went down well but just didn't go with the food.  Other than that I have nothing bad to say about this amazing experience.  I heard many people getting substitutes for things they didn't want and there were no issues.  I think this place is still as good as everyone reviewed and I wouldn't avoid it.  They are searching nationally for a new executive chef and I think that will change things but for now it's still an amazing place and I can't wait to go back.~~#~1
I've been going to Lux for years.  It's always been #1.  It is terrrribly, painfully hip, but somehow it isn't uncomfortable there, and there really isn't a snide vibe that I have detected in my billion visits (oh and I would have).  I stopped going for a while prior to the big move because it was constantly packed, with lines out the door and internet speed that was reminiscent of mid-90s dial-up.  I rediscovered how much I liked making french-pressed coffee at home.I've been around, coffee-wise, and Lux is always the best.  In fact, I'm so used to Lux, that when I get a crappy drink somewhere else, I assume that something out of the ordinary has happened, because it is so bad.  Repeat visits to offending spots (Lola, Lucy's) has confirmed that, no, they didn't make a mistake - they just suck.  Also, Lux's whipped cream is TO DIE.  I don't even like whipped cream, but you should see what happens when they forget to add it.~~#~1
I Love, Love, (Let me repeat it once more for effect) LOVE this place. I was invited out to brunch with a few people and was unsure about this place, it was kinda hidden behind the home depot...in fact I missed it the first time I went there. Being a vegetarian I looked at the menu and noted almost everything had meat...which may be my only small issue with the place..the lunch is pretty meat based. HOWEVER!!! one beautifully glow point...they will take it out, make exceptions and add things with no issue. Once they came out with it wrong, it was taken off my bill, immediately fixed, apologized for and I have never had any issue with service. Actually, haha I've been in several time but my last visit was in August(Which this is where I demanded breakfast/lunch on my birthday). I walked in Saturday at 12:10, told them I needed to be out by 12:30 and they were incredibly accommodating. Made sure I was seated where I could read (I went alone) and the food was out by 12:20, so I had enough time to eat, pay and leave. Also the waitress thought ahead and brought my drink in a to go cup. The (I believe) manager Kat remembered me from August! Execellent customer service, Excellent Food and to the person who complained about prices...have you been to IHOP/Dennys Or Village Inn lately? Crackers is on the same level if not somewhat cheaper for some things. P.S. Try the tea & Bread Pudding! Its great and my vegetarian friends don't be afraid to tell them to subtract the meats.I always get the New Hampshire Skillet - No Meat, add in tomatoes, spinach, mushrooms and it comes with broccoli. YUM! )~~#~1
This is the best restaurant in the state of Arizona, the food, the staff, the decor, this is the total package! The best also comes with a price you can expect from the best, but you dont eat here every night. Treat yourself, whether its boys night out, a special occasion, or you just so happen to be in town and need a darn good meal this is the place. The bone in filet is my suggestion as rarely in life does one come across a bone in fliet. I dont know how you can save room for dessert, so just force it down, its all great!~~#~1
Wow, this place has amazing food!  It is so refreshing to see vegetarian food with variety, flavor and creativity.   I wanted to eat every single thing on the menu, and so did my friend.  We decided to start off with the hummus of the day (Butternut squash), and split two meals, the vegan tacos and the burger of the day (Sweet potato and Mill).  The tacos were filled with a spiced walnut "meat" vegan nacho cheese and sour cream and served in red cabbage cups.  They were soooo good, I would have never thought to use walnuts as meat substitute, brilliant! The burger was another big winner! It had a jalapeño curry sauce that was so flavorful, and it paired nicely with the sweet potato and avocado. On the side were yummy baked fries with homemade barbeque sauce... still licking my lips!  I'll definitely be back, again, and again, and AGAIN!~~#~1
Let me just tell you... if buying a wig for an exciting night of Big Hair Bingo weren't enough the little Korean guy that runs this store is a hoot.All of the famous (I use this term very loosely) drag queens in Phoenix buy their wigs from Panorama.  I spent a little more than I would have spent at a costume shop for my wig, but it is a high quality synthetic hair that will last a long time.This is in what I would call an up and coming part of the city... be sure to stop by and support this great local biz.~~#~1
The only reason to go to this (or any) Whole Foods - and the 5 star review - is for their delicious MARY'S AIR COOLED CHICKEN in the butcher department, and HONEYMOON SWEETS at their bakery. All other items are a rip-off and anyone with a brain would buy at Safeway, instead, and warrant a 1 star rating.The chicken - Mary's Air Cooled fresh chicken - and Honeymoon Sweets, are unparalelled anywhere in America for fresh chicken and pastries and mini desserts.~~#~1
I love this restaurant.I eat an incredibly strict paleo-ish diet which means I don't eat the following:canola oil, soy oil, sugar, flour, farmed salmon (served by virtually every other restaurant in town including True Food Kitchen), grain fed beef, and a host of other food.  It sounds awful, but believe it or not there is no limit to the number of incredibly delicious meals that can be made despite these limitations.  Unfortunately, these meals *almost* always have to be home cooked.  Restaurants simply have not gotten to delivering a pure, healthy meal.Well, that changed when I discovered Nourish.  Their menu consists of a variety of items that I can eat.  As a bonus, their food actually tastes great.There isn't much more for me to say: a restaurant that cooks healthy food that I can enjoy.  Given my incredibly strict definition of the word healthy (and I admit that this is a relatively subject label as the scientific research stands in the year 2012), Nourish is one of the few restaurants I can enjoy.  And so I love them.Other notes: the service was hit or miss when they opened but these days it has gotten a *lot* better, to the point where I rarely have a problem.~~#~1
I decided to go in after I saw a "lunch specials" sign out front by the road. The menu said nothing about lunch specials and when I asked the waiter/manager what the lunch specials were he said "ahh well whatever you order I will be sure to make it extra special". I ordered a chicken gyro which was $8 on the menu (overpriced to begin with). The gyro came out and there was nothing special about it. It tasted ok but was not made with a fresh pita. When the bill came it had nothing special done to it, it was still 8$. I had to ask where my lunch special was and the waiter took the bill back and went to his terminal and printed out another bill with 10% off. Wow, some special. Nothing like getting lied to to make someone feel special. I will not go back to this restaurant based on the misleading false advertising and the lie that I would get something special. Don't waste your time or money on a place like this.~~#~0
My husband and I LOVE the pizza. He went with the mushroom & ricotta pizza and I went with the build-your-own. For dessert we ordered the tiramisu, it had a pine nut brittle. FANTASTIC. We can't wait to go back.Our waitresses personality was a little lackluster, but the food more than made up for it.~~#~1
What a find! I went here expecting to order a salad and was pleasantly surprised by the GLUTEN FREE PIZZA sign on the door. Yippee!!The pizza was excellent (and that is not easy to do with gluten free)! I also loved the fennel salad. It was so nice to have the shop right there, we bought a bottle of wine and they were happy to just add it to our dinner bill rather than making two payments. We had outstanding service and did not have to wait more than 5 minutes for a table. I am traveling to Phoenix again this fall and this will be a must visit restaurant.~~#~1
Cheap, fast, great quality food. I'm from the east coast and never understood the in n out hype but now I can say I am officially a convert. I think my boyfriend saying "this tastes like a burger I would take off the grill at home" sums the food up perfectly. It's not your typical frozen, preservative laden piece of meat. On top of that, the fries are fresh cut daily and are delicious. Would eat this over the other big name fast food joints any day of the week.~~#~1
Buy this pizza and save some to reheat in the oven the next day. AMAZING.~~#~1
I had the shrimp po boy, dirty rice, and catfish with some delish sweet tea!!! ALL was excellent and we received very good service all around...will be back soon!!You can also get delivery here through You Buy and We Fly: http://youbuyandwefly.deliverycheckout.com/~~#~1
The food is a solid five but the service and staff can be rated 1000000/5. This restaurant is locally owned and it shows.  On a hot summer day, the lady at the counter gave me a ride to a nearby location after my dehydrated, heat exhausted self ordered a Pizza Hoagie. The employees are nice folk who won't hesitate to help a fellow man (or woman) out. And yum. I sure love the Pizza Hoagie.A lot of people come for the food and stay for the lively conversation. I stay for both. Give me more Casella's!Keep in mind that this place only excepts cash.~~#~1
This place has like... .4 or 5 tables....MAKE A RESERVATION!For reals.This place has killer food.  Killer.It's so good.  I love it.~~#~1
This has got to be one of the best churches I've been to.  During my travels I definitely get a little nervous about visiting another church for mass.  I cannot stand judgmental churches and was looking for a place near our hotel that would not be.  This place was far from judgmental.  While the congregation may appear to be older and more conservative, they were incredibly lively, welcoming, and friendly.  Before the mass starts, they welcome visitors and everyone greets each other beforehand.  The music is amazing and they even had one lector who was a radio announcer (made for an excellent reading).  While there, they had a presiding priest who gave a great and funny homily.  All in all a wonderful and welcoming congregation.  If I'm ever in the area again and needing to go to mass.  I'll definitely put this place at the top of my list.~~#~1
Sales dept. is ok service dept. is lacking in integrity. Long story short. Had oil change and was informed that my low mileage Kia sedona was in immediate need of rear brake disc pads since they were down to 2mm. Told service adviser I doubted that work was needed . He became adamant that had to be done right now. Took to Sands kia for service and on the inspection worksheet they noted that my rear brake pads were now at 6mm. You be the judge.~~#~0
I recently went to Sunland Auto Service for a transmission issue. I got a quote from another place, then, when I had the money for the repair a month later, the original place raised the price by $400! That was enough for me to look for another "car guy". I turned to Yelp for the best, and I found them.Bob and his crew not only re-checked the problem and gave me a 2nd opinion, they charged me less than I expected. I needed a transmission re-build, and  Bob was even awesome enough to work with me on a payment plan. He treated me fairly, kindly, honestly, and trusted me to pay him back with just a handshake and my word. I will be back to Sunland if I have any future repair needs. I will also recommend them to everyone I know.~~#~1
I really would not eat here, I dined here on Saturday 6/16 and used my bank card, after my card was charged and it went through I have continued to get charges from AAPA Investments out of Mesa in which owns Genghis Grill. They keep trying to charge my $15-30 dollar increments continually since Saturday, I had to cancel my bank card, file a claim with my bank, etc. It has been a nightmare, I will never be dining here again due to their fraudulent and unauthorized use of my bank card after I had already been charged. Very Very shady activity.~~#~0
They have a shuttle bus 6-2 a.m.!!!  Woohoo, can't beat that! Happy hour til 7!!  Woohoo, can't beat that!Poker tues/thurs!!  Woohoo, can't be that!A+ Brushetta!! Woohoo, can't beat that!Service not to shabby!! Woohoo, can't beat that!~~#~1
Pino's should be your stop if your not in brooklyn, or Italia.  His place has the best Italian Menu in town.  Italian owner Pino is always smiling and welcoming his second family, his guest.  The Menu definitely has it's New York flavor with just a simple folded paper with all the items.  His Pizza's are delicious try something different every time you will not be dissapointed.  One of Pino's specialty pizza's is the Pinos Pasta Pizza a very interesting pie that packs the carbs, but you will want it all the time.Calzones... What can I say about them?  I will put anyone up against Pino's!  His calzones are simply amazing.  You can mix and match them to your liking.  His ingredients are superb!  If you like Prosciutto Di Parma make sure its on your calzone with some tomatoes, fontina cheese and he will do the rest.I can talk about this place for hours.... I have been a longtime customer and Pino is working on helping me with my Italian after all the visits I have made.  Parking is tuff so be ready to walk.  His place is small and cozy he does have some servers that can occasionally need a kick but the food and some good wine will erase that thought pretty quickly. Buona Fortuna~~#~1
Excellent sushi.  Menu items are also very good.  Small interior.  Nice sushi bar as well as the restaurant.  Staff very friendly and attentive.  Reasonably priced.  Nice central location in North Scottsdale.  Good ambience.~~#~1
I like Bookmans over Barnes and Noble because there is a large selection of lightly used books/DVDs/video games selling for half price. Also they're a great place to buy magazines for those airplane rides/road trips. Bookmans usually has the issues for the current year, so if you don't mind having someone else's address on your magazine this place is for you.You can also trade in your books/CDs/DVDs for store credit. I don't recommend selling your stuff for cash because the offer they give is VERY low.~~#~1
Fight off the old ladies!Come in this place and show up early... no no they still will get to your car but if you want some coffee or a chance at a seat you better fend off the other happy customers that found this place way before you!Customer retention is something any business owner dreams of.. now as I try to sneak in the door I am rushed with loyal customers who are treating the day as if its black friday and this place has door busters !What the heck?? This place came well recommended by the body shop next to them.. but seriously? A little conversation  with customers later and I learn that they have been in business a really.. really long time and used to be a gas service station. Well.. these customers not only followed them here but have been coming back forever!I had an alignment done.. really fair price, done on time and overall just walked away towards my car  with a smile about it all. I do most of my own work on my trucks and as such friends are always asking for help because they are afraid of getting ripped off. Well now I have another great place to send them!I love the way they treat customers and their cars :)5 very well deserved stars I was going to say 4.. but I assume the old lady's would track me down to make me change it!~~#~1
Love to sit at outside bar. Staff very nice and helpful and fish tacos are yummy and carne asada is BEST EVER.~~#~1
Ok bad Mary. I have lived here for almost 30 years and have never been here!!!!WHY??????? But in my defense there were no Yelp sites back then to push me into going by writing a glowing review. All I can say is drop what you are doing now and go. This place is amazing! You do not have to be a big archi lover to enjoy the wonders of this place.(And the view aint half bad either)  If you get the Culture Pass that the Phx Libraries offer you can get the basic tour for free. 4 passes at 26 dollars a pop for free can you believe it? It only costs  a few more dollars to upgrade to the next tour. BARGAIN!!!!!!! You have to go on a tour you just can't go and wander around there since people live here and it is a private school. ( BTW that Culture Pass thing is a gem! I might have to write a separate review for it!) bring tons of water, walking shoes,hats, your camera, and be forewarned it is hot. A lot of the tour is outside or in hotter buildings with little air venting but hey a small price to pay to see this place of a great minded man!PS- we did bring a small child. Although most people on here say it is not child friendly children may enjoy it if they are interested in art or old buildings.  I must say they would have to be children who have been exposed to longer tours at musuems before so use caution. The tour guides love kids though so if you have an inquisitive little one bring them along. .~~#~1
Went on a weeknight and it wasn't too crowded, but perfect for getting drinks after school/work.  Had a glass of wine called kung fu girl, nachos, and mac n' cheese. The mac n cheese was sinfully delicious.. seriously, it was so creamy and rich, I felt my waistline expanding, but it was too good that I couldn't stop myself.  It was a little too creamy and salty for my liking, but that's because I like to eat a little on the light side.  The nachos were to die for- the pulled pork was a surprisingly good combination with the regular nacho toppings- definitely didn't see that one coming!  I'm waiting for a good occasion to try this place again; nice little romantic date spot I'd say ;)~~#~1
I'm a big Chop Suey fan but its not a lunch special  so I ordered off the regular menu, I can't say I was impressed, although the veggies were crunchy there wasn't much flavor to the sauce.The booths are dirty and this old building is in great need of a remodel.  I wouldn't have ever stopped in if it weren't for some glowing reviews by other Yelpers.To top it off there was constant yelling or arguing coming from the kitchen and a man putting boxes together behind a screen in the dining room, ever heard one of those loud tape dispensers throughout your meal!?I visited this location off it's previous reviews and I have to say they disappointed me.~~#~0
Absolutely fabulous!!!! Service was great and the food was spectacular. I highly recommend the Curry Soup. OMG!  Try this place you will be happy you did.~~#~1
I come to Cap'n Bills a couple times a week. I think the quality is better than the big chain sub shops and the price is better. I usually get a 5" sub for just over $3! I love this place! If you read the other reviews you know it's a unique place with bumper stickers, pictures and stuff everywhere. I like that I see something new every time I visit. I can also come in and order my "usual" now so it makes the experience that much better! Thank you Cap'n Bill and crew for the awesome food and service!!~~#~1
Stuffed ourselves with great authentic Burmese food for less than $12 per person!Thanks to all the fellow yelpers for pointing us to Little Rangoon during our visit to Scottdale. In trying to find good eats outside our resort hotel in Paradise Valley, we found this little gem in a strip mall, with a friendly owner, great food and service, for our large party of 9. We had chicken skewers for the kids, Tobu Salad (homemade Burmese style tofu from yellow soy beans), Talapia Curry, Chicken Kebob (marinated and stir-fried with jalapenos), Malaysian Rice Noodles, Baby Bok Choy and Shitake Mushrooms which were all excellent.  Two of us in our party had actually visited Burma and lived in Thailand, and thought the food was authentically Burmese.The decor and ambience was warm and inviting. Alfred the owner chatted with us for quite a while as he and his wife were both from the SF Bay area like ourselves.  The wait staff was attentive and quick with our order.We got a whopping 30% off our order, so the check came to about $12 per person -- really great value for the quality of food.We so want this mom-and-pop business to survive in this economy, so we're yelping about their great food and service, and hope if you are in the Scottsdale area, you'll try it and enjoy it as much as we did!~~#~1
Another well executed breakfast sandwich only 3 problems. 1- where is the ham I ordered and paid for, 2- what happen to my egg, 3- and that's a half a slice of cheese on there! WTF !!! I hate fast food joints sometimes~~#~0
I have to say I am very impressed with Smart & Final. Time after time they deliver. And best yet, they have SALES on already discounted wholesale items. I find the oddest, hard to find foods there too! So if you have been searching high and low for that speciality item, try looking here. They just might have it.I buy filet mignon from here too and I have to say that their meats have always been fresh, good quality meat - at prices lower than other wholesale markets that we shop.Even better yet, is the quick in & out time. I never have to deal with crowds or long lines. It is quick, comfortable and affordable shopping.~~#~1
This place has the best carne asada burritos in the world!! Any time we are in Phoenix, it is one of the places I have to go, in fact, I went there twice on my last trip.  The prices are great, cute little place with great, authentic Mexican food.~~#~1
I went to Grassroots Kitchen & Tap with a decent sized group last Saturday night and we did not have a problem getting a table. The ambiance is perfect - it is relaxed, with an intimate feel to the place without being overly stuffy. It has a full bar in the middle of the restaurant and appears to have roll-up garage doors on one side of the restaurant for nice days. There are also community tables with game boards in the table (I only saw checkers but there may be other games).In short, the food was phenomenal, which I expected based on my love for Wally's. I ordered the Roti and Ribs entree, which includes some ribs and part of a rotisserie chicken. It comes with Grassroots' cole slaw, which is not to be missed. The slaw has a slight Asian twist to it that is really delicious. It also comes with a side of beans - loaded with bacon of course. I also ordered a side of the shoestring potatoes. Everything was fabulous. Others in my party ordered burgers and the short ribs and they loved their food as well but my Roti and Ribs platter stole the show. I can't recommend that entree enough - it was absolutely delicious!The staff was awesome, the service was awesome, the ambiance was awesome and most importantly the food was awesome. I will definitely be returning to Grassroots Kitchen & Tap sometime soon!~~#~1
I had breakfast at the Chompie's at the Mercado Del Rancho Center and it pains me to write that this breakfast stands out as the worst breakfast I have ever had, ever. If you think about it, you really have to go out of your way to screw up breakfast but they managed.We knew we were off to a bad start when we stood at the entrance for about 5 minutes (Please Wait to be Seated) for someone to seat us in a 1/2 empty dining room. The waiter was attentive so no problems there. The problems started when the food arrived. 3 of us had menu variations of corn-beef hash and poached eggs. The corn-beef had the look and texture of road kill and the eggs were hard boiled. 2 of us requested that the eggs be re-done but only one of us received it after assurances from the wait staff that it was "on its way...". The food was also more or less room temp when it arrived.To be fair, there are a lot of Chompie's and maybe this was a bad day at a singe location. The menu is extensive and I did see other customers orders that looked more appetizing. It would appear that they have good food but the execution was the problem. We might try it again and order something different.~~#~0
Great place to eat, I love the jalapeno hummus and the chipolte chicken lavosh pizza. The atmosphere is alive, great energy and has a fresh new look with a friendly staff. I think this is the largest Pita Jungle that I have seen it's defiantly the nicest location. Lots of seating inside and out. Can't wait for the weather to get warmer so we can enjoy the patio area. The best part of having this great new place is that its only 1 block away from where I live, perfect walking distance. The only thing I did not like about this place was that it closes way to early 10 pm and on First Friday it should stay open to at least 12 or 1am. Hope they adjust those hours soon, so Check it out.... =o)~~#~1
I wish I could put an exclamation point after my five stars. I cannot leave this store without buying at least one pair of shoes. They have something for everyone...every style, size, and price range. You must go check out the clearance rack in the back because you can snag a fabulous deal on typically pricey, designer shoes. They also have a variety of super cute purses, of all colors and sizes. I joined the DSW rewards program and receive coupons and deals frequently throughout the year. Great store!~~#~1
Heaven on earth...you had me at Belgium chocolate. You are amazing, please move into my refrigerator, I promise to buy a walk in.~~#~1
Cool store!  Support local business!~~#~1
My ethnic experience isn't rooted in the middle eastern culture, but my fiancee's is, and she goes nuts in here buying some awesome, interesting, and delicious gear like tahini, chick peas, za'atar, feta, etc for making things like hummus, za'atar bread, and the like.  I picked up a half-rack of lamb chops and a side of couscous for prepping ($12) together.  Their butcher is awesome and far different from retail grocery chains in Phoenix.  They have a mountain of hooves, FYI.  Typically, the prices are inexpensive-to-reasonable, but sometimes the rarer items are a bit elevated in price.  That is totally understandable considering the unavailability of this type of product nearly anywhere else in the valley.  They make you put at least $10 on your debit, so be aware, though they have so much good stuff that this fee is easy to surpass.~~#~1
I can describe this place in four words: simple, healthy, delicious, and inexpensive!I love this place. I'll start with the simple part. You can either order plates or bowls. The plates are the same as the bowls, but plus a side of salad and the fresh local fruit they have that day. As for the structure of the bowls, you can get some combination of meat, vegetables, and rice. For rice, you can choose between white and brown. The vegetables are just an assortment of the standard vegetables. The meat is either chicken or ribeye meat.On to the healthy part: The rice is always steamed, never any oil, etc. added into anything! No trans fats in any of their dishes! The meat is charbroiled, in order to maintain the oil-free thing. The skin is removed from all of the chicken to reduce the fat content. This is probably the healthiest option for food anywhere near ASU.Delicious: The sauce that they have is great. I would say it's some kind of modification of a teriyaki sauce, and you can tell a lot of effort went into that sauce. They only have the one sauce, but it is a great one. They have a cajun-hot sauce on the side, also, in case you want to add a little heat, which I usually do. Inexpensive: The bowls are around $5.00. They don't look that big, but because they are so healthy, they will fill you up. The first week I tried this place, I went back 3 times (3 days in a row). I cannot get enough of this place and I will be back soon.~~#~1
Disgusting.Have you ever experienced a time where you are just craving sushi, so much that even a philadelphia roll platter would do? If so, have you ever been so revolted you couldn't finish the roll?I hope you haven't. This was my first experience with that and I was left heartbroken and sad and wishing I had never decided to give this place a chance. While the decor is amazing, the menu looks unique and spectacular and even the rolls looked amazingly tempting when I brought them home, the love affair stops there. It's all superficial, and I don't date that type.~~#~0
I make sure to stop in here every time i am in the Phoenix area.  Great music and excellent service make this a place worth checking out for a few of their cheap drinks.  Tuesday evenings a great house band called Chocolate Fountain will keep you grooving!  Great local bands take turns filling the stage through out the rest of the week and weekend.  Venus is one of the nicest bartenders in the valley and she will pour you an honest drink as will all the staff behind this bar.  Oh yeah bar shuffleboard on hand for the sporty types.~~#~1
I loooove this restaurant. Everything is wonderful. The service is fantastic and all the waiters are very nice, the ambiance is intimate, classy, and romantic, and the food is delicious. The creme brulee dessert is a must-try and comes as a plate of creme brulee with a cookie gondola with chocolate and berries. Plenty of good wines available, too. And, as an added perk, you get a free gondola ride pass if you have dinner here. There is a lagoon behind the hotel where gondoliers will row you around and sing to you. Magical experience. :)~~#~1
Love love love the sushi here! The salmon tempura, boston #2, and the dynamite (VERY spicy) rolls are delicious!~~#~1
Friendly staff.  Exteremly helpful!  All craft stores (AHEM MICHAELS @ TMP), should have employees like this place does!  Left with everything I needed for my baby shower favors, AND beading materials to fix my two lanyards.~~#~1
I'm from LA and went to Richardson's while in town for the weekend. All I have to say is WOW. Food was great, nice atmoshphere, and friendly waitstaff. Great grilled meats & New Mexican food.   Highly recommend the tomatillo toast. The pork enchiladas were really nice as well.~~#~1
I go to lunch here regularly and the food is consistent and excellent. The owners are always friendly and recognize us when we come in. The red lentil soup is amazing. Falafel and hummus is really good too.~~#~1
Honest, fast, and reliable.  Great guys and great machines.  Bought my first from them over two years ago- got a great deal.  It has been turned on and used every day since and has never so much as hiccupped once.  Thank you!!~~#~1
People often comment that various Social Media outlets are a waste of time, brain power and lead to a loss of workplace productivity. For me, sites like Twitter and Facebook are a way to connect with like minded people and stay up to date on news and current events. For the Dwivedi family, Social media turned out to be a lifesaver.Last night FnB Restaurant in Old Town Scottsdale hosted the "Tiny Fab Kidney Fund" late night dinner service to benefit Amy Donohue & The Dwivedi family.  Before getting to the food, a little background on the event. A decade ago, Anu Dwivedi was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease. Six months ago, her kidney function down to twenty percent, she was told the transplant waiting list was up to six years long. (not a prospect that brought comfort to her family).Anu's foodie daughter Kirti decided to put her social media obsession to use via Facebook with a page she created titled "Kidney disease and my tiny mother," to learn and share her family's experience.Amy Donohue saw the page and decided she could help. She contacted Kirti, got the required tests done and the rest as they say, is history (or will be in the coming weeks when the transplant surgery is done).In addition to the inspired cuisine FnB is becoming famous for, Chef Charlene Badman whipped up a few Indian inspired dishes in honor of the Dwivedi's. (half of all revenue from food & beverage from 10PM on + 100 percent of the proceeds of a silent auction totaling approximately $1300 went to the Tiny Fab Kidney Fund).On to the nights food! My appetizer consisted of lightly battered, perfectly fried rock shrimp ($13) served with a well balanced jalapeño tartar sauce (with a hint of Meyer lemon and fresh herbs).Alongside my rock shrimp was a heaping serving of three varieties of cauliflower , tossed with spanish peanuts, marinated in fish sauce and mint whose soft insides were perfectly complemented by their deep fried crunch. (this dish is simply delicious!)Next up were a pair of Samosas ($5) filled with creamy sweet potato and accompanied by a small bit of sweet, tangy dipping sauce who's components slip my mind (Blogger/foodie foul).Grilled spicy broccoli ($8) with pistachio and Meyer lemon aioli is flat out the best thing to ever happen to that humble green vegetable (its because of this dish that I know when broccoli season is).A piping hot serving of traditional Punjabi Butter chicken (Makhan Wala Murgh) served over Basmati rice rounded out my meal. (I imagine this type of curry to be comfort food in Punjab).If I had one complaint about the butter chicken it's that I feel the sauce to rice ratio could have been better. The rich, creamy sauce definitely would have benefitted from more rice in my opinion but the flavors were great.So then, social media is informative, recreational and the bane of workplace performance but you never know, someday it could very well save your life or that of someone you love.Side note: If you have ever wondered what it's like to experience true hospitality, make a reservation at FnB. Co-owner and front of house manager Pavle Milic is a study in graciousness, sincerity, service and will make you feel as welcome as anywhere you've ever been.~~#~1
I'm giving 5-stars to this Walgreen's for the exemplary service I received at the drive-through pharmacy today.First of all, let me say that my pharmacy experience is colored by the typically lousy experience I get at the Fry's Marketplace pharmacy near my house. In the case of Fry's, they typically ignore you when you come to the window, take 40-minutes to fill any prescription - even something that's in a box and all they have to do is pull it off the shelf. I've even had them take 40-minutes and then tell me that they were out of the medicine and I needed to go to another store.Enough about Fry's - eventually I'll write a review of them - and back to today's tremendous experience at Walgreen's.Because my in-law's are currently out of town, I agreed to pick up a prescription for my wife's grandmother and deliver it to her nursing home. My mother-in-law told me that I could just go through the drive-through and get it. Unfortunately, when I got there it turned out the refill had never been ordered. Luckily, the pharmacist looked in the computer, determined the needed medication, put in the refill and told me it would be ready in 20-minutes.I took my kids to run another errand and then came back to the store. When we came back to the drive-through, the first pharmacist still couldn't find the prescription in the system. However, instead of giving me the brush-off, as the would have at Fry's, she went and found the pharmacist I had talked with 20-minutes earlier. As it so happened, that pharmacist was in the midst of filling the prescription and they had the medication to me in less than 5-minutes.Despite the fact that Fry's is just around the corner, I may be transferring the family prescriptions to Walgreen's. It's a nice change to deal with people who actually make the extra effort and who seem to care,~~#~1
Great food at good prices, incredibly fast service even when busy, welcoming atmosphere, definitely recommend.~~#~1
Just have to add that I was so impressed with Veneto Trattoria that I ended up eating there three times in a two week span!  The food and the service were consistently great.  Can't wait to get back to Scottsdale!~~#~1
Easley's is very cool.  The staff is knowlegable.  They have costumes and costume accessories galore.It is a lot of fun!~~#~1
As long as you know what you're getting, it doesn't get any better.  I was here yesterday and had the $3.50 special- fantastic! Bacon was crisp as ordered, hash browns were crisp, and they say it's a two egg breakfast, but these have to be the biggest 2 eggs I've ever seen.  Today I'm going there with gf to get hot wings and potato skins (it's 6:30 a.m. I know but I've been out all night, and isn't it great to get wings at 6:30 in the morning?!!!), and I've never had the skins so idk if they're good or not but based on everything I've had, it won't suck. The wings are basic Red Hot/butter variety, but as good as Long Wongs.  Service is always excellent, even when the owner is serving.~~#~1
For $5 a person you get to learn a little of local history.Did you know there is a large petroglyph and pictograph site right here in Phoenix?  You walk around with a map and locate various rocks and read about the history of the people who decorated the area with the symbols.  It's educational and fascinating.We had the luck of running into the ranger by the name of Desert Little Bear Gonzales who took us on a personal tour since he wasn't doing anything at the moment.  He told us more history than the literature offered and even pointed out a large owl sitting in a tree.  He shined a mirror at it to catch its attention and told us about the wildlife in the area.  It was enchanting listening to his stories.  You could tell he really enjoyed what he was doing.I've even thought about having him speak in my class.If you want to learn a little about Arizona, I'd suggest stopping by.  It's cheap (the money goes toward preservation of the area, also), and close by and worth at least one visit.~~#~1
I took my daughter here for a special night out and it was so much fun. She wanted to stay and watch the movie another time. I had hesitated about going in the past because I thought the movie sound and quality would not be very good. I was wrong, it was excellent.~~#~1
The BEST restaurant in the USA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The burnt tomato salad, and anything from the robata menu are all musts:)Beautiful atmosphere and great service.~~#~1
My favorite lunch spot. Fresh food, amazing fruit, great fries and friendly service!~~#~1
wow, the happy hour here is killer for the gourmet food selection they have.the food is asian-fusion ( i usually hate when restaurants throw "fusion" into any description, it's such an overused trendy word, but i don't mind because it's so good), and during happy hour, their tasty and elegantly served creations are so affordable.think of it this way, you can either have chicken wings and fried zuchini for happy hour snacks, or, for a few dollar more, have a Kobe beef burger with matchstick fries, seared ahi or tiger prawn spring rolls. it would be a great place to take a new person your dating... familiar foods cooked outside the box that look and taste like their really expensive but are very reasonable.~~#~1
Qdoba is just another cheap Mexican place (very similar to Chipotle) but it's still really good!Expect the usual combinations of rice, bean, meat, etc... but they have a wider variety of choices like taco salads and quesidillas too.The place was clean and the staff was quick, helpful and polite.  Plus Qdoba offers a frequent buyers card and you can redeem your "points" for free food.  Eveybody like free food!~~#~1
We have all been to Starbucks, and know the deal, so I will just say that the baristas here are super friendly, and the atmosphere is very welcoming.  Plenty of seating, and you will always find an array of people on their computers, reading, etc.~~#~1
Great trail for those that want a fairly easy hike. It's been pretty quiet every time I've gone which is nice. A few different paths with varying degrees of difficulty keep this trail feeling new to me when I go. Fun for a newbie like myself to see wildlife - nothing scary, just some lizards, rabbits & birds. Fabulous views when you get up high!~~#~1
Live cover band, fantastic drinks and tasty sweet photo chips and other yummy appetizers in cast iron ware! So cute. This place is awesome for a Saturday night with friends. An array of beer selection on tap.~~#~1
Extremely disappointed in this restaurant. Solely came here based on the reviews which all fell short. The hangover sandwich did not have a full egg on it and when I requested avocado I was only giventwo slices on one side. I ended up just eating a avocado and bacon sandwich due to the lack of ingredients. As for my "double mimosa" it came in the smallest glass with the weakest contents of champaign. Yet another let down was the horrible service by our waitress. She failed to bring out water or check on us consistently but paid little attention or our requests. I have had better customer service in McDonalds drive thru to say the least. This place will not be getting my service again.~~#~0
Love this Place!! Bomb Street Tacos for cheap!!  Saw this place on Triple D and made my family try!! OF course they loved it! Everytime i hear about this place i get hungry!!! Doesnt matter if i am in food coma or not!If you haven't tried this place then you are Trippin'!!!! Go there RIGHT NOW!!!~~#~1
Attentive, friendly staff! Delicious food!~~#~1
STAY AWAY.  ABSOLUTE CROOKS!  They were referred by AHS Home Warranty company (that's a whole other can of worms) to fix our water heater.  Long story short, their technician said we needed to replace water heater and then claimed that they would need an additional $350 out of my pocket due to "modifications" needed to electrical and water lines.  I was not there when technician came out.  Turns out all connections to water heater are flexible (gooseneck) which does not require any modification at all.  C N J services was simply trying to RIP OFF $350 from me because I was not there when they came out (my tenant met them).Stay far away from these crooks.  I will also be filing COMPLAINTS with the BBB and the AZ REGISTRAR OF CONTRACTORS against this very shady company.~~#~0
I first visited this location yesterday. I was shopping around for a Galaxy S3 for my mom. The associate I talked to recommended I look around at Walmart and Fry's to check prices, and said they could price match. Because they don't sell T Mobile phones in store, it needed to be ordered and sent to the house. I came back today and decided to buy two of the phones. I talked to the same guy, Roman, and he was EXTREMELY helpful and kind. He didn't charge us for shipping or anything extra. After price matching, we got two phones for what T Mobile wanted to charge for one. We got great customer service here and I would definitely return!~~#~1
My favorite Friday night! I always look forward to the end of work each week to note the 40 hours have been put in and it is time to start the weekend.  I can't say enough how I absolutely love The Watering Hole draft beer and wine bar.  At happy hour prices you can't beat, choice of any bottle to open off the beer wall or $5.00 for a beer sampling, what's not to love.I appreciate the camaraderie of all the patrons who purchase their pizzas and share it too!  So much fun deliciousness, must thank James for designing such a wonderful hang out!~~#~1
Sorry, but I have to do this.I have had good sushi experiences so many times at this place, but one near-death event really helps to wipe those memories away.I got food poisoning from the sushi bar.  I know it was the sushi bar, because the only other thing I had eaten that day was toast.  By the time I finished the roll, my stomach was already starting to feel weird - how contaminated does that stuff have to be if it causes your body IMMEDIATE PAIN?  Whatever was wrong with this fish was super wrong, because I vomited on the hour all night (I had the sushi for lunch) and well into the next morning.  I called and spoke to the manager who was vaguely sympathetic, but otherwise very breezy and unconcerned.  He told me he'd refund my meal the next time I went in, but rolling in there with no receipt and a half-hearted promise from a guy on the phone seems like the makings for an annoying situation.I can't ever eat their sushi again, which is unfortunate for me, but this episode was SO VERY BAD AND PAINFUL that I simply can't take the risk and I wouldn't encourage anyone else to either.~~#~0
Wow, I'm really glad that they have this listed on here, great.  Ok, so here we go:The concept of outdoor malls have become so prevalent and widespread, warmer weather destinations can no longer lay exclusive claim to them, Columbus, OH, has a great one, but Kierland Commons really shines as a people watcher's paradise.  You can see a little bit of everything here, honest.  I've been here enough times to tell you that, yep, the Yanni-looking dude with the bright red Ferrari F430, seen'em; the absolutely amazing-looking model-ridiculous women, seen'em; the standard-fare scottsdale gold diggers with their botoxed faces and newly acquired bosoms, seen'em; and the completely confused self-conscious snowbirds, causing numerous near accidents, seen'em.  I've seen it all at this place.  Like a pooch in a car on a warm spring day, I love sticking my head out the window and taking it all in at this place.  Have fun and enjoy the plastic fantastics.~~#~1
Best sandwich shop in Scottsdale. Great service. Delicious food. I usually get the ham and Brie but everything else I've had is awesome. Go..~~#~1
Very impressed on my first visit. Tried Red Curry Chicken Hot and it was no joke. The rice was nice and cooked perfectly. I know that rice is the most mundane part of the meal but if if they can't get that right there's definitely a problem. They are big on curries and have kind of a small menu. Hot is hot here and that's what I'm lookin for. Looks like a young  Thai couple run it and they are super nice. I'll be back for sure..~~#~1
I love this yogurt shop! It is always clean and well stocked. The people up front are friendly. I also like that they always have fruit flavors and not just cookies n cream. I think this is the best one in Phoenix.~~#~1
Now this is some good souuuul fooood! Better than roscoe's in Los Angeles~~#~1
This visit was deff a 5 star!  Got the banh mi, and it was amazing!  For anyone who has never tried it, its a Vietnamese sandwich served on a baguette.  It is an absolute must, especially on the days it's too hot to eat pho.  Service was awesome - Esteban is super friendly and cool.Once again, I had a great visit with excellent food and drinks and will return soon!~~#~1
Yuck.I like the idea of bargain hunting, and who doesn't love a deal? But Last Chance is just a disaster.The racks are cramped together, and completely disorganized. Even in the middle of the day the place was packed with really scary woman (I've never, ever been violently shoved away from a clothing rack before. Maybe we're just overly polite and reserved in Canada, but we call that kind of thing "assault".)Every single item I tried on was either ripped, covered in some sort of unsettling stain, or looked like it had been through the washing machine. Getting 50% off a Calvin Klein dress isn't really a big deal when the entire left seam is ripped open. All of the shoes were scuffed and worn-looking.Maybe somewhere, deep, deep down underneath the piles of clothes on the floor and aggressive warrior-shoppers there is a deal: but only if you have a good seamstress and drycleaner. Otherwise, I'd rather pay the extra $30 and go somewhere else.~~#~0
Stacy, many congrats on your well-deserved designation of one of the top 10 new BBQ joints in Bon Appetit. Today's lunch was, as always, delectable. Your pulled pork makes me smile and my tummy sing. People.....get thee to Stacy's if you have not been yet. Come hungry. Try the ribs your first time out. You will be in awe. Greens, candied yams, red beans and rice....the list goes on. It's alllllll good!~~#~1
This place is awesome! I got a behind a scenes tour and got to meet Dave Muncey, Jon Hook, Kerri Lake, Troy what's his face and others.  Most were really nice.  It was fun taking pics all over the studios, sitting at the newsdesk, morning show, etc.  Most of the people who work here are very friendly.  Most of these one/two star reviews come from angry viewers.  Maybe they should take a tour and meet the people who make it happen and then they could appreciate it more.~~#~1

There's so much right about this place, I'm not sure where to begin! The beer selection is AMAZING, and the bartender let me sample a few (on tap, of course) before I made my selection. I am a fan of wheat beers, but there's a certain flavor I've never been able to tolerate in about half I've had. When I explained this to the bartender after my first sample, she knew exactly what I was talking about, and told me it's the type of the yeast used. She then gave me a sample of one that didn't have that particular flavor. I love it when someone not only listens, but engages on the topic with knowledge!Since we were sitting at the bar, our bartender was also our server. She recommended the Chicken Thai sausage with the apricot chutney (after hearing me say I wanted something spicy), and was once again steered in the right direction. It was incredible. We also ordered some of the Belgian fries with the bleu cheese and bacon sauce, also just beyond... Then, for the piece de resistance, we split a piece of the  Drunken Date Cake. I'm not even that big a fan of sweet food, but this cake... takes the cake. Some customers came in when the kitchen was about to close, but were not turned away. The manager even told them he would fire up the grill and cook the order up himself if the kitchen were indeed closed. Talk about great customer service!The music being played is great, the atmosphere is comfortable and completely unpretentious, the service is excellent, the food perfection... seriously, what more good stuff can I say? I will not only be returning, but I will also be recommending this place to everyone I know!~~#~1
I love this Jamba Juice! I always order the same thing here, which isn't even on the menu anymore and they never question it. They are very fast and efficient.  I prefer to go to this one rather than the one that's closer to my house!~~#~1
5 stars for an Arizona bagel. 3.5 for NYC.~~#~1
I love this outdoor shopping center. I can walk around to different stores and can feel relieved and not irritated. It's a family orientated shopping center, but you can find all walks of life here. Also there are some pretty good eatery at this center. If your not shopping for anything, grab a bite to eat or catch a movie. Or even just bring your little ones to play at the play/splash area. It's a cool shopping center to go to.~~#~1
What a great little barber shop!!! I've been meaning to come down, and finally found the time. Got me a great haircut, neck shave and head massage all for under $20!!!  Each cutting station has it's own personal TV, I was able to watch some football while getting a cut. It's truly a nice barbershop, granite counter tops and the old school barber shop chairs.  This is what's it's all about, small local businesses!!  Good work Gentleman Joe's!!!~~#~1
Alright, you know from David B. what sort of offerings you'll find at Conspire. I'm just going to focus on two things: coffee and buttons.John, who is the man behind the coffee, is the master of the espresso machine. He pumps out a cafe americano that is silky smooth and just the right temperature. It frankly punches the lights out of any other cafe americano. If ya feel like a latte or mocha, fear not - he's not going to make it sickly sweet. You'll still be able to tell there's actually espresso in it. So that's the lowdown on the coffee.Now let's talk buttons: There are hundreds to choose from starting at 50 cents. Some are thought-provoking, some are hysterical, some are both. I mean, who doesn't need a button with a hand-drawn picture of the fabled tortoise going down on the fabled hare? I certainly do, and my life is better now that I have one.~~#~1
We came here for the "build your own" pancake deal, after leaving another location that smelled funny & where we were stood without being seated or noticed for a few minutes. This location took care of us! The food was excellent & our server was great - even refilling drinks without asking. We will definitely go back.~~#~1
Great service & food. We got there before 4pm & got a drink from the bar next door and waited til 5 for restaurant to open.  At 5, they opened and took first 44 people in to sit down. We sat at the counter. Had Spiedini appetizer, caprese salad, house greens, wise guy & marghuerita pizzas. They gave great Italian bread also. Food and service was excellent! If you want the best in fresh pizza, you have to try this- one of the best ever....their reputation is well deserved! Get there early or you will wait a long time......~~#~1
I love this place. I've traveled throughout Mexico quite a bit and can say these are the most authentic tacos I've had in Phoenix.  You can even order a michelada. Yum yum yum.~~#~1
Oh my gosh.  The stuffed crust cheese is insanely good!!!!!~~#~1
Oh! This feels good!My schedule is FULL and I have family and work that keep it juggled. AZ Mobile Massage is a life send for that. She comes to YOU, sets up the table, ambiance and its in the comforts of YOUR place.Great service!!~~#~1
FRESH (in season ingredients), FLAVORFUL,  healthier alternative without sacrifice!!!!! YES!!!! CheckFood (overall) GREAT!  CheckGood: Garlic Chicken Flatbread.Tasty, awesome price and perfectly satisfied me:  Spicy Tandoori Chicken Skewers w/ fresh mango chutney & cucumber herb raita (normally I don't like chutney but the mango was so fresh and flavorful I DEVOURED it) and normally with organic mixed greens salad (but I was hankering for the Kalymnos Greek Salad and they were fabulous to switch it for me).Perfectly cooked, tender, mouth-watering w/ a kick-y drizzle of the chipotle sour cream:Grilled Buffalo Steak w/green veg trio, fresh corn, roasted mushrooms and chipotle sour cream.Drinks good.  Check Ambience FAB!  CheckNicole (our server) attentive and great!  CheckHostess friendly!  CheckOther restaurant staff who delivered and made our food perfectly to our specifications!  CheckDefinitely will go back, thanks!!!~~#~1
Funny thing about Phoenix: you never know where you can find a decent bite to eat.Every year my buddies and I head down for a long weekend of Spring Training and lap dances. This year I decided I'd do some research on restaurants, as we'd been disappointed way too often.After a long night at the Candy Store we headed to Delux. I was a little nervous about the strip mall location, but then I remembered "this is Phoenix."We showed up around 11:30 on a Sunday night. The place was packed, but they had a seat for us. The burger was awesome, only overshadowed by the incredible shopping cart of fries.~~#~1
So I've eaten at Flo's three times this week and had to review it. I've been coming to Flo's for about three years now and have enjoyed the experience every time. I will say this though, its loud. It can make it difficult to hear and carry on a conversation especially if you have a big group.Nonetheless, the food is yummy and always comes out quick. I usually get the same thing, garlic chicken and I ask them to spice it up. I've gotten some friends hooked on it as well. The owner/manager is always walking around, not sure if her name is Ms Flo, but she is always asking patrons if everything is ok. My answer is always yes. Btw, you can order to go as well. There are several other Flo's around town but this one is by far my favorite. Oh its way cheap too.~~#~1
Located on the edge of Mesa and Chandler lies this gem of a small town Mexican restaurant. The food is authentic and delicious. It's owned by a family who still has their deep roots in Mexico and brings all the traditional flavors back with them. If you are feeling adventures to try something other than their delicious bean and cheese burrito, I  recommend the carne asada torta.~~#~1
Living next to my favorite restaurant puts a real dent into my wallet, but it's worth it. I first tried Chelsea's Kitchen three years ago and I still can't stop myself from going back. They have the best shoe string french fries a girl could ask for with some BBQ rub seasoning that leaves you licking your fingers to the very last fry. When I first started going there I had to try their cheeseburger and I couldn't put the juicy burger down. Now, my obsession is the Brussels Sprout Salad....with maybe a starter of french fries...sorry, it's just too hard! The salad has a great, fresh dressing while still tasting the delicious bite of the Brussels sprout.The wait staff in the first two years were patient and attentive. Lately, it hasn't been at it's best, but hopefully it will get better in the new year.My family and friends haunt this place regularly and we have tried everything. I also recommend trying Dr. B.'s Vegetarian Tacos...well because they're good first off and second off it's my best friend's dad. And he definitely deserves to have this meal dedicated to him.  The decor is perfect for us Arcadia kids and parents and disguises the canal well. Love you Cheslea's Kitchen!!!~~#~1
I guess this place would be okay if they know you.If you're not in their computer,forget about buying shoes here.It doesn't matter if you know your size in a particular brand,they still won't sell them to you without making a specific appointment...Really?You're a retail location with an unlocked door;allowing the public in,but you need an appointment to buy stock shoes????Or,did you just not want to sell to me?I realize I'm not your typical demographic,but understand you lost an almost 200.00 sale in the first place,in the second place,I will never be back,nor will I sing any praises to any other dancers looking for shoes or anything else.Maybe you have all the clientelle you need.If that's the case,lock your fucking door and only allow in whatever chosen few you deem worthy.It's a shame Phoenix is so limited in certain areas that shop keepers can come up with insane ridiculous rules because they know they corner the market on specific goods.I realize some might say"oh,but these are special dance shoes and must be fitted properly"..I get that...If someone had never been fitted,worn or bought prior....But I knew what I was looking for as well as the size.If that is the case as well,they sell them online...Do I need to make an appointment to buy them online too?????Useless bullshit.Oh,PS; I did go elsewhere and was able to purchase what I needed with no goddamn appointment,no hassle and no princess attitude.I ended up buying more than just the shoes,which is why I can say that you lost an almost 200.00 sale...I was in and out in less than half an hour as well.If Macy's demanded appointments to buy clothes,everyone would be running around naked.That's probably not  attractive as reality that you might imagine...~~#~0
Not into the long drawn out reviews. This place is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE JOINT in town. You can eat anything from a great pizza, to sushi or the best omelette n town. The daybreaker is the bomb and so is the spicy tuna roll.~~#~1
My husband and I went here, after a recommendation, for our Anniversary.  I called in advance for a reservation (don't think it is required) and when I called they asked if it was a special occasion. I told her it was our Anniversary.We arrived 30 minutes early and they seated us early (only waited 5 minutes).  When we got to our table there was an Anniversary card signed by all the staff and a rose on our table.  Sweet!The waitress was very nice.  We ordered the Beef Ribs (which was amazing, falling off the bone) and the Salmon (so good).We received a complementary dessert since our Anniversary.  The Huckleberry Cheesecake...MMM!!!I highly recommend this place for a date!  Romantic and Intimate!~~#~1
J alexanders has an amazing atmosphere, adorable waiters and awesome food.  Try the filet with loaded baked potato.  So good!!!!!~~#~1
The first time in my life that I had meat literally fall off the bone. I tried their steak, ribs and chicken. It was all fantastic!~~#~1
Carolina's is one of my Top Ten reasons I don't leave AZ. I've always dreamed of living near the beach and maybe someday I will. Until then, I keep a list of things I would miss if I left AZ. Carolina's Mexican Food is always in my Top Ten. Yes, the place is a dive and the line can be long, but the amazing authentic Mexican food and incredibly cheap prices more than makes up for it. The hard machaca beef tacos are my favorite. Anything with their machaca beef is outstanding: slow-cooked, seasoned, and shredded to melt-in-your-mouth perfection. It's available with green chile peppers, red chile peppers, or plain. It's served in a taco, a burrito, or anyway you'd like. Sour cream and guacamole are great extras. Another important tip: Carolina's freshly made tortillas are legendary. Be sure to take a dozen home. They're homemade and served warm in a plastic bag. If you're like me, you'll only have 9 or 10 left by then time you drive home.~~#~1
This place rocks! Great Carne Asada, friendly staff, convenient location and great business plan. I've tried many things on the menu and everything is good so I can't narrow it down to just one or two items. It's a great story how this place started so read about it while waiting for your food. Highly recommend!~~#~1
It's like Disneyland for winos! Although I'm not much of a wine drinker, their selection is outstanding. But that goes for the beer and other liquors, too. The prices are great and are usually lower than most other places. They offer wine classes and wine tastings, but I've never partook in either. The staff is nice, friendly, and very helpful with suggestions and answers. My favorite indulgences I seem to only find here: Lindt Chocolate Bar with Almonds and Darrell Lea Soft Liquorice. :)~~#~1
What the hell is up with the music?!? You can't dance to it, you can't get into it. We went on 7/31 and it just drug the whole night down. I think three people sat and watched the guys playing. Really? You pay for these guys to be here? Even with the bean bag toss and ping pong and all the good things about The Monastery, the music bit big time! Ugh, it makes me not wanna come back anytime soon.~~#~0
Buonos is Great Pizza. I'm an ex New Yorker and I've been here since 1993. It took me several years to find a place that was just like Home. This is it. It's like being in a New York Neighborhood pizzeria. Go out of your way and visit this place. you will Love it.~~#~1
Hands down the best pizza in AZ! Favorite place to take out of town guests. Make sure you order the Burrata. Best appetizer that will be inhaled. Perfect blend of fresh homemade mozzarella, prosciutto, balsamic vinegar and toasted bread. The pizza is second to none. There can be a little wait, but just grab a glass of wine and relax on the patio.~~#~1
Great place to go when everything else is closed. The food was a thumbs up, my omelet was very small but a great tasting. I also tried some of my dads waffle and it was the best. that's not all, my mom's biscut & gravy was definitely the best!!!!  And on top of that the waiter was very nice plus he gave us comment on my dad's rocky shirt and said " this man still got it " and he made sure we were happy by coming by when we were served asking us to have a malt but we were fine and we loved it anyways without a malt . I highly recommend this dinner to friends & family even the press~~#~1
I forgive their crowdedness always because it's so good. Last night my child's school had a fundraiser there (read: damn good excuse to go back) and since it's less than a mile from her school, we rocked it after I picked her up. Pizza muffins are always the thing ordered no matter the group, and I love that they have at least one local San Tan Brewery beer on tap mostly always, and it was only $2 a pint! When I go, I always get the Calzone. The two item calzone is how I roll and I am a traditional ricotta kinda guy; they sure do load it up, so I always order that. If we have 2+ people we like to also get the antipasto salad, which is always made fresh and tasty with ingredients that seem to be picked daily. Tonight my daughter had the ravioli from the full children's menu and her mother said it was quite tasty, too. Unless you have a large party for the party room, there's usually a well worth it wait, but last night we noticed they're remodeling so I bet they're adding more seating through a previously sealed off area. Go team!~~#~1
Tearless Brazilian? Yes! I'm giving them 5 stars for the quality of the wax (OMG! I could never go back to soft wax!), good/prompt service & clean facility. Heads up regarding 3 little issues: 1. The illusion of privacy is non existent, lol. In most places that I have been to they will leave the room to have you undress & give you a napkin to use as a blanket. No such thing here. They will prep the wax while you shake & shimmy out of your clothes. You are getting a Brazilian wax though,so really, what aren't they going to see anyway? 2. They might hand you to a total stranger,,, & by that I mean an esthetician, so don't get all excited! I wanted to have a good experience so I researched who had been named in the reviews. I got an appt with Rachel C. When I arrived I said I have an appt with Rachel C. She said "of course! Please take a seat". Someone came out & called my name. I thought she was Rachel C, but it sure wasn't. I was doing this thing no matter what, so I wasn't turning back over the ol' sitch-a-roo! All went fabulously anyway, but now I'm not relying on names. 3. Flexibility. Each appt is set for a specific block of time, but even if they have time left over you can't sneak any other services in. No biggie, just make sure you plan ahead.~~#~1
This is such a cool disc golf store, right next to the course at Vista del Camino. My wife and I went in "just to look around" after playing a round (just before going to the bar next door) and we were so pleased with the selection that we ended up buying 3 discs, a bunch of their excellent minis, etc.. This store also has a very high profile in sponsoring events and supporting the sport of disc golf. Another great thing they do is hold onto lost and found discs, which is important since many of the local courses have disc-eating water hazards...better yet, they even list the lost discs on their website!If you're a disc golfer visiting Phoenix, you HAVE to stop by Spinners.~~#~1
1. The tomatillo red is the absolute best. I could eat it on anything.2. They have a great app for your phone. It stores your favorite order, your card # (if you want), and you just click, send the order, walk in, laugh at everyone waiting in line, and get your food.~~#~1
Oh dear god, I'm in love...Peppered Filet and Martini Scallop dreams fill my mind. Blue Cheese stuffed olives in my martini?? what?? shut the fuck UP!! Sooooo amazing. Quality all the way. I had a glass of Byron Pinot Noir (fabulous) then a white chocolate martini for desert. (I prefer to drink my desert). Great romantic spot to bring a date. Secures that you will be getting action later, trust me. If you see me at Cheuvront stop by and say hello. I'll be the one in the corner making sweet love to the macaroni and cheese..... no joke.~~#~1
I was at yogurtology and found out that they have "doggie yogurt" there  from time to time.  What fun was it to walk up last night to watch a couple of ladies feeding their dogs out of small cups at a table on the walkway out front.  Did it seem out of place, not at all.  Another thing I like about this store and this center.Call about the "doggie yogurt" if you want some.  They don't always have it.~~#~1
Well, I think Philthy Phil's closed up. I heard a few things from the rumor mill. One was the owner had some personal problems and the bar had to go. The other was that a bad fight broke out (seems more likely). Unfortunately, I found out the hard way when I drove out on a Friday night and the place was empty. This dive/club had some great DJs on the weekends but I guess it wasn't meant to be.It's odd that it closed as the New Times did an interview there about a month ago. http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/bella/2011/01/phil_edwards_at_philthy_phils.phphttp://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/jackalope/2010/09/mike_potts_of_philthy_phils.php~~#~1
Best Curry ever:) Nice little outdoor patio- so cute you forget it faces the parking lot! Love the fresh ingredients and imaginative flavors. Wonderful!~~#~1
Cheba Hut's "toasted" theme and winking titles wouldn't mean nada if they didn't deliver with their goods. The menu is huge (and just got bigger), and the toasted subs are overflowing with fresh-tasting ingredients. There are many veggie options if that's the way you like it.Unlike the big chains, Cheba's employees seem to be having a good time and are always up for a chat or a joke. These guys made getting a study break sub an awesome experience. They've usually got good toons on and occasionally The Simpsons or Family Guy, not to mention decor that can catch your attention like you're...well, you know. Stay open later guys!!!~~#~1
Phoenix friends, if you haven't experienced Barrio Café you done know what you are missing.  I anticipated a little taquerid was pleasantly surprised to find this to be do much more.  Guacamole made tableside was excellent, the seasonal Poblano chili dish was amazing. Service was excellent and we will definitely be returning.~~#~1
This place deserves a 4.5 rating. It is really small, and the owner is the only server. However, she is attentive, and the food is received in a timely manner. I went with my boyfriend. We shared a barbacoa quesadilla and carne asada tacos. Both were great! Everything is well seasoned, and the guacamole and salsas were homemade and tasty. The horchata is good, but it is a little too sweet.~~#~1
Tremendous!  Great beer and wine selection.  Fantastic, loaded salads.  Creative selection of sides and sandwiches that all deliver.  Cool patio.  Nice atmosphere inside as well.  Dark, hip, chill, great music.  Laid back, friendly, attentive service.  Perfect first time, and I'll be back next week for more.~~#~1
By far the best burger joint that I've found around town... Smashburger comes close, but not close enough since the prices of the two places are pretty much the same.~~#~1
For most of what I've seen in Scottsdale its super pre-fab chains and this was a great break from that! The bruschetta and pizzas were amazing.  People were also fans of the desserts and pastas.  And generally speaking it was pretty reasonable for the quality and quantity.  Highly recommend.~~#~1
I drive by this place all the time. But I never really paid any attention to it. I mean, candy - really? Is this a place I need to know about?But at the recent OYE at Bliss Rebar, Chris B was talking about how amazing a place it was. This weekend we decided to surprise our kids so we gave them each a budget and turned them loose. Wow!The first thing you notice is that the place is jammed. And everyone there thinks they're little kids. It's not hard. Aside from the candy that's popular today, there are the perennial choices and (drum roll please) all the candy you remember from when you were a kid - whenever that was. So there were giggling five year olds and giddy 75 year olds. And everyone was buying.The owners (whose names I'm sad to say I didn't get) are from my old stomping ground, Cleveland. They have a 20,000 sf facility at Brookpark and Ridge, the largest of its kind in the country. They are very nice and happy to help with whatever you need. Sadly, they don't carry melting chocolate, which would have saved me a pre-Christmas trip to Phoenix every year. But who knows, maybe they'll change their minds. Also, in case they're paying attention, they should seriously consider carrying Malley's Easter candy. It's a Cleveland institution.Bottom line, this place is a must! It's fun and will take you back to whatever your childhood era was. The prices are fair and the people are great.Now if you'll excuse me, I hear a tootsie roll calling my name.~~#~1
Squaw is the easier of the two tough Phoenix city hikes.  I say this because parking has always been easier for me (I park in the little lot just before the gate to the park) and because you never have to use your hands, so you can just carry a bottle of water without worrying about it getting in the way later.  That said, you need strong legs for this or else you will feel the pain and burn.  Lots of people enjoy running up or down, but I'd watch out if you have bad knees or ankles.  I have bad ankles, so I hike down swiftly, but avoid the run.  Just like Camelback, there are incredible views from the top which make the toil worth it.~~#~1
I can not say enough wonderful things about Definitely Debra. Her sincere desire to please her customers, her competitive pricing and her energetic and wonderful personality make her a pleasure to do business with. As for her products, they are second to none. My grandmother called my wedding invitation "the nicest I've ever seen," and I couldn't have been happier. I would recommend Debbie to anyone looking for a great product with a personal touch.~~#~1
Top quality furnture - if you are looking for the best of the best, shop at Red.  Also, the owner is very nice, and is always willing to help.  It's worth a visit even if you aren't considering making an actual purchase.  There are things there that you won't see anywhere else in this state.~~#~1
My cousin and auntie were here visiting from Michigan.  My mother and I searched high and lo for an Eastern Europe restaurant and we found it.  This has got to be the best place in Arizona.  It didn't appear from the outside, but once you stepped in, It's very clean, newly remodeled.  The waiter was very kind, but what do you expect, it's Eastern Europe :)  Definitely would go here again!~~#~1
I use this UPS store as a mailing hub for my small business. I have NEVER had any problems with packages coming in or going out and I have sent out hundreds of packages in the past 3 years I have had a box with them.  They are always friendly and greet me by name. I feel like I live in a small town again and not just another ant in the sea of people in the valley.~~#~1
Boba Tea House is always consistent with their boba.  I've been to so many boba places.  Many places just don't make them quite right -- if it's right, it's soft and squishy; the places that get it wrong don't cook it long enough, and it turns out too hard and chewy.  Sometimes I'll find a place that made good boba, but when I return on a different visit, it's not the same.  Boba Tea House gets it right every time.  I always just order their boba milk tea.  My sister likes their mini-boba, but that's only good if you like a lot of little boba balls swishing around in your mouth -- it kind of tickles. The service has been good here on all of my recent visits, and I'm always satisfied.  I pretty much always stop here when I go shopping at Lee Lee's.~~#~1
1st time here. Super great customer service and helpful because unless youre business like this place is overwhelming. I got 2 photo wedding enlargements& if I need anything in this speciality I will return.~~#~1
I've been shopping here since opening day 10+ years ago.  This is the ONLY place to buy fresh fish and prime meats.  the service is fantastic and friendly.  Seafood is way fresher (and cheaper) than whole foods.  There is no better Fillet Mignon you can buy to make at home.  The bacon may look like that in other supermarkets, but it's way better.  Fresh, never frozen.  This is what makes their chicken breasts taste better.  This is the best selection of fruits and vegetables anywhere in Scottsdale.  Everything is always super fresh especially compared to a regular supermarket.~~#~1
OMG!  I am a boba addict.  When I read about Fresco here on Yelp! and saw how close it was to my home, I just had to try it.  I went there and ordered the Bingsoo.  I asked the gentleman behind the counter if he suggested yogurt or ice cream, and he said yogurt.  I'm not a huge fan of exotic fruits (or berries for that matter) and he told me I could choose 3 fruits and one fruit sauce.  Being the boring fruit eater that I am, I chose banana and double pineapple with strawberry sauce.  And, of course BOBA.  I asked him if there was a specific way to eat it and he told me to mix it all up.  I did and was in heaven from the first bite.  It was amazingly refreshing, as well as just downright delish.  I will be visiting this place regularly on the weekends for a bingsoo fix, but this morning I will try their milk tea with, of course ... BOBA!I HIGHLY recommend this place.  5 stars for sure!!!~~#~1
This comfortable little cigar shop is hidden in a strip mall next to an off-track betting bar and a nail salon. The leather chairs are perfect for enjoying a smoke after rifling through the well-priced selections in the humidor. Mike, the owner, is incredibly friendly and doesn't mind if you want to pop in a movie (which they have quite a few choices readily available) on the flat-screen and eat your lunch while you kick back. Keep an ear open for when they have a customer appreciation day. The last one included free pizza, a cigar, scotch tasting, and a soda. Can't turn down a find like that!~~#~1
I'm not a fan.  The food was okay, but everything else was disappointing.  Our service was friendly, but not professional and I was turned off by the plastic wrapped food display.For the price, I expect way more.  I won't be returning.~~#~0
Excellent!  Very good food and service. Loved the dark rum mojito.~~#~1
Best in town and i've eaten at a lot of different sushi bars.  This one takes the cake well beyond even some more expensive Scottsdale locations.Sushi is fresh and tasty.  The arrangements are very nice, not over the top so you still know what you're about to eat.  Happy hour menu contains lots of $5 choices, including large sake bombers!  If you're vegan or veg, this place has lots of options for you.  Get the Veggie Gyoza appetizer, you will not regret it.Staff is extremely friendly, seating is unique with a long cushioned bench along one side.  Perfect for groups of up to 8-10.To the regulars: please stop bringing your babies.  I know happy hour is worthy of daily visits, but your kids are crying because they don't want to be there.~~#~1
Oh man...A+...Boyfriend took me here for dinner to celebrate our anniversary and it couldn't have been more perfect. We are vegan, and they even had a wonderful tofu dish on the menu...Everything we ordered was amazing and delicious. Service was outstanding and I would highly recommend this place for a special occasion or weekend cocktails. :)~~#~1
Dr Brooks Owned Aspire skin care which went out of business without even notifying his patients. I am now stuck with facial hair and he refuses to refund money because he thinks he did enough treatments. I wouldnt trust him. He is a liar and an obvious cheat. Thanks for the sincere honesty and ingerity you have towards your patients!!~~#~0
Great experience here.  I called last week, made an appointment with Robin, all paperwork was handled electronically and Robin introduced herself to me when I arrived.  Thorough cleaning, friendly staff, easy peasy.~~#~1
Awsome, Awsome, Awsome... I was ordering cupcakes for my boyfriends birthday. After a few e-mails I followed a great suggestion of a dutch chocolate cupcake with brown sugar frosting and a BACON toffee topper.  I got mini cupcakes so that there would be enough to go around and they were perfect and so delishious.  I cant say more great cupcakes, great service.~~#~1
First of all, the people who work here are great and very welcoming. It's great!At first I didn't know this place was vegan, and when I found out I was surprised. It's great! I'm vegetarian and try to eat vegan foods as much as possible. I also do not eat gluten, and it's great that they have vegan, and gluten free pastries! As well as vegan and gluten free ice cream.The price is very reasonably, $5.00 on the dot, for an ice cream. You can even add extra pecans or strawberries, etc., at no extra cost. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants great ice cream! Vegan, vegetarian, or not, I'm sure everyone will enjoy it. The decor is nice as well. With local artists selling their artwork. It's very minimalistic. Which is very nice. It goes with the PHX downtown vibe.~~#~1
Go on a Tuesday you will get bruschetta and wine for $20!! The bruschetta is stupid good!! Huge wine selection and if you dont drink wine they have a full bar. Best neighborhood spot in Arcadia. Oh and it's super sexy too! Perfect for those who are looking for the perfect date spot.Just go you will love it...trust me!~~#~1
I'm usually an AMC man, and Arizona Center 24 is my guilty pleasure. However, went here with some friends last night to see Daybreakers. Wasn't disappointed at all. I forgot how nice it is to be around a new theater...Place was organized, and especially for how intensely crowded it was. Staff were nice, and found some people we didn't know worked there at the theater, always a plus to see a familiar face. Saw the movie- not the best, but interesting hahaha. The theater was HUGE and the sound was absolutely impeccable. Far superior to the sound systems at any other theater I'd been to. But this is where the fun part starts. Got into my friend's car, (we carpooled there) and made my way back to their place. At this time I realized my own car key has fallen out of my shorts' pocket. Looks like I've lost my last spare key. And to all the Volkswagen owners, you KNOW how hard it is to find that little black piece of plastic. At this time, panic ensued. Frantically went back to the theater, and waited for the current showing of the movie to be over in order to search high and low for my key. When everyone left, we all looked under every seat in our area. The manager then came in, and helped us look for it. Apparently there are pockets between the seats which collect things which have fallen out of people's pant pockets. The man reached out from under the seat, revealing my lonely little VW key. Definitely worth the two hours of stressing, I almost didn't come back to the theater in the first place. I'd like to applaud the customer service here, thanks for being so incredibly helpful!~~#~1
An excellent spa for the ultimate in pampering and relaxation. I've been to the Willow Stream spa twice, and I can't wait until my next spa day retreat there. The treatments are pretty typical for resorts, but what really sets this place apart is the atmosphere. The facilities are spacious and modern, and there are several places for one to sit snd and enjoy the day either alone or with a few friends.My favorite spot on the inside is the atrium, which is very "zen" with tree cover, chirping birds, water ponds, and teak patio furniture. Sitting there makes me feel like I'm miles and miles away from Arizona. My second favorite place to sit is just outside the treatment area where there are two small waterfalls that flow into what feels like a little private garden. The amenities are plentiful: a gym, yoga, cafe service, roof top pool, waterfall treatment area, not to mention the bathroom and sauna area. I could really spend all day there. The only missing element is poolside drink service.~~#~1
I've had all their Tacos and they are all excellent.  My favorite are Cabo Shrimp & Oaxaca Black Mole Tacos.  The best way to enjoy the tacos in this place is to put them into rotation like in baseball and do the same with the multitudes of creative salsa.  The worse thing about La Condesa is their tacos made you wonder what the hell did you eat at Taco Bell.~~#~1
This is the best Rubio's I have been to. The standard good:Tacos- steak, chicken, grilled fish, breaded fish, shrimp, all yummyIce cold beerHelp yourself to the Salsa Bar with fresh cut lemons, limes, and jalepeños, too.This location's extra goodness:Cute Tiki patio...huge lighted tiki umbrella, and at least one other smaller tiki umbrella. I forget to take pix a lot, sorry! Exceptional customer service- especially the two dark hair young women. The cashier and the expo girl worked very well together. They served food to customers, kept everything clean, were quick and efficient during the lunch rush and did everything with a smile. I wish I knew their names to mention.Try the new mango habenero ono taco! Good place if you have children.~~#~1
Discovered a leak on our water heater around 8pm on a Friday night.  Yikes!Had to shut the water main off and call plumbers.  Luckily, I remembered our HOA uses city wide for all plumbing issues.  Their office didn't open until 8am the next morning (Saturday), but they had someone here by 10am.  Fixed the issue (wasn't the actual water heater itself).  Cost $180.  Not too bad, I guess.  Especially when you need water!~~#~1
Great hand pulled noodles are a textured sensation! Watching your noodles being pulled to order is an added extra! Very simple preparations so don't expect a lot of complexity. Just plain good noodles.~~#~1
I was visiting Scottsdale and was looking for great Mexican food.  I live in Boston, where we have great food, and even a couple of very good Mexican restaurants, but I figured that in the Southwest, Mexcellence would abound.  Boy, was I wrong!  I read all the reviews on Yelp of dozens of restaurants, and finally decided to try Los Sombreros for a late dinner on Friday night, Feb 6 2009.  I was in AZ by myself, so I figured I'd eat at the bar and get a great eye on how the place worked.  Many Yelpers mentioned a lively bar scene, Steve the bartender, his attentiveness & his margaritas, so I headed there hoping he'd be working. Well, no Steve.  And my first disappointment was that not one Yelper mentioned that the bar is OUTSIDE!!  I know it's Arizona, but a cold front had come through & it was only 48 degrees.  I'm a Bostonian.  I'm not afraid of the cold, but if even one Yelper had mentioned that the bar was outdoors, I'd have chosen another restaurant.  The bar also has only 6 seats (well, 7 if you count the one where the pole in your face is closer to you than the worst seat at Fenway or in the old Boston Garden - that seat lacks bar top space sufficient to even hold a drink).As a salsamaniac, I was looking forward to the salsa because so many Yelpers had raved about it.  People!!  When the salsa is a tomatillo salsa, you should at least mention that fact!  42 reviews and not one person thought to mention that the salsa is green?!?  I love tomatillos, but I was looking forward to a tomato-based salsa and didn't get one.  And as tomatillo salsas go, this was average, at very best. I loved the fact that later in the evening, Los Sombreros re-activates its happy hour menu & offers a variety of plates for $5. That was cool, and I tried the guac & chips.  Again, disappointment.    The avocado had some brown spots and the chunks were so big that they snapped every single chip I tried to use to "dip" into the guac.  The only way to eat it was to use the fork to pick up the avocado chunks and put them on the chips.  I can't even say that the avocado was diced.  It was chunked, at best, so the "guacamole" consisted of chunks of avocado & a little seasoning. And speaking of the chips . . . at even an average Mexican restaurant, I expect them to be warm & well-salted.  These were cold, slightly stale, huge and virtually salt-free. I ordered a margarita.  At a Mexican restaurant, especially when I'm seated at the bar, I don't expect to see my margarita poured out of a pre-mixed bottle.  And I don't expect it to taste worse than the pre-mixed Cuervo margaritas we had at the last Jimmy Buffett tailgate.  If crowds necessitate making your house margarita in batches ahead of time, that's understandable.  But don't pour from the big tub for the people actually seated at the bar.  That's just dumb bar management. My entree was a delicious sounding shrimp, tortilla & cheese concoction (I apologize for neglecting to write down its actual name).  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good, either.  It arrived looking like a Mexican shrimp & cheese casserole, with pieces of tortilla so large that two cuts of each tortilla piece were necessary in order to create an appropriately-sized bite.  The shrimp were delicious, but come on - how tough is it to cook shrimp?  The tortillas, tomatoes and cheese were messy & melty, but there was nothing special about the dish.  The strongest flavor came from the shrimp, and that should tell you a lot. Overall, I felt cheated.  I wasted one of my few evenings in Scottsdale on Mexican food and a restaurant experience easily beatable on Route 1 in Medford, MA at anyplace with a sombrero you choose to try.  Seriously - steer well clear of Los Sombreros.  You can save a bundle by going to the grocery store & picking up some Old El Paso.  It won't be worse.~~#~0
Not sure that it's any better than other options in the US Air terminal there at Sky Harbor, but it was bad. Slow service and awful food. Even the diet coke seemed to be mixed incorrectly. Had an overpriced sandwich with waffle fries that were coated in some weird mixture. I was trying to avoid the other awful fast food options there, but I should have just gone to burger king.~~#~0
I went here twice since then and the workers were much nicer, no bratty attitudes, still teenagers but thats fine with me. Now I'm obsessed with this place, the food is sooo good! I love their bread and the ton of lettuce they put on your sandwich. My favorite so far is the warm roast beef, try it, it's great!~~#~1
We had high hopes for Zpizza.  I loved their selection of pizza combos, crusts, and toppings - and then I tried the pizza....Bland, cheap with toppings, metallic sauce - no wonder they offer so many combinations, they're hoping you find one that doesn't suck.  Droopy, soggy crust too - maybe they should worry less about their website and more about their food.  The kicker tonight was to find out that they don't deliver their mediocre pizza outside of three miles.  This means they don't deliver to most of DC Ranch and none of McDowell Mountain Ranch or Windgate Ranch - genius.~~#~0
The fact that this place is so crowded at lunchtime just confirms my suspicion that most Scottsdale residents have more money than taste.  This place is aggressively mediocre and proud of it.  You could get better Chinese at Applebee's for a lot less money.  I had to load on the soy sauce and chili oil just to make my lunch have any taste at all, and even then it tasted like mildly spiced dishwater.  Pretty bad when even your chili oil lacks flavor and authenticity.~~#~0
Great service. Will put you in agreat mood.~~#~1
I only got to this place once while I was in Arizona and really intended to go back--maybe next trip!.  They had really wonderful spaghetti with white clam sauce, an item I often try but rarely find as good as my home place in California--San Fillipo's in La Mesa.  My daughter got the calzones, which she had had here before and knew they were good.  I had a taste and while that is an item I never order, they were delicious!  The atmosphere here was very nice also and I was really glad we had chosen it.  It's one I wouldn't hesitate to recommend to others.~~#~1
I recently leased my first new car in 12 years. The dealership told me to have my first service performed at 5,000 miles, so I stopped in here to get it done. The mechanic took a look at it, came back 5 minutes later, and asked me if I was aware that my car didn't need its first service until 7,500 miles. I was not aware! He still checked my fluid levels for free, sent me on my way, and told me to come back after another 2500 miles. I definitely will.~~#~1
We were hesitant to try out Palatte because the other reviews seemed to hit both ends of the spectrum, but we had a WONDERFUL experience. The patio was pleasant, breezy and misty, I almost couldn't believe that I was in Phoenix. Normally I'm not much for brunch music (it usually ends up being Jimmy Buffett covers or cheesy jazz that rubs my hangover the wrong way), but the guy playing rocked in a mellow way.Our server was attentive and our food came out pretty quickly, even though we ordered just after a large party. I'm a vegetarian, and there were tons of options on the menu--it was hard to choose. My fiancee is a definite lover of the meat, and he was stoked with the selection, too. After much deliberation I settled on the Potato Mishmash with no bacon (potatoes, eggs, gouda, carmelized onions...), and he went with the Sausage Mishmash. The portions were just right, and the flavor pairings were perfect.This was the best brunch experience I've ever had. And I don't give that compliment lightly. DE-LISH.~~#~1
I enjoy the beef chow fun and the honey walnut shrimp.  Taste like I'm back in San Fransisco so I would say pretty good Chinese food in Arizona :)I like the fat noodles, lots of meat, strong flavors, and great portions.  They use onions and yes I do like it since it adds flavor to the dish, I just don't eat all the onions.  Only thing let on the plate is some onions after I'm done with it.  If you want good Chinese food in Surprise this is the place.~~#~1
The best way I can think of to describe Steve's Krazy Sub is that it is like Subway, but better in almost every way. They don't have as many bread choices, but the bread tastes better. Basically all of the ingredients taste better. The first time I went, I had the Poorboy, which was delicious. Second time, I had a Super Sub, also delicious. Next time I will probably get my Sandwiches without Mustard though, because it is a little overpowering. Can't forget the pickles, which are delicious!My absolute favorite part about Krazy Sub is the prices. For comparison, Subway has a $6.00 Box lunch special, which only has a 6" sub, then you add on the tax. At Krazy Sub, You can get one of their lunch specials, which also has the drinks and chips, but with a FOOTLONG sub for $6.00 after tax! Suck it, Subway! Also, the subs are generally cheaper. The smallest size, their "mini", is an 8" sub and the prices are comparable, maybe cheaper, than Subway's 6" subs. The people here are pretty friendly, but the owner is especially friendly. He always has a smile on his face and loves talking to the customers. When I was leaving, I almost drove away with my drink on top of my car (put it there while I put some stuff in the car and forgot about it) and he rushed outside to prevent me from spilling it all over and making a mess of my car. Thanks!Anyways, I'm going back again for lunch today, and I suggest you try it out sometime. It's definitely one of the best deals around for food, especially at lunch.~~#~1
I love everything about Coach!  They stand behind their product 100% and not many places can say that. I recently had to send a bag back to the repair department and they were unable to repair it, so they sent me a voucher for the value of the bag I returned so I could replace it.  I used my voucher at this location and was thrilled with the service I recieved.  The gentleman who assisted me with my purchase was honest and very helpful.  All of the sales associates are friendly, but not pushy or snooty.  All of the products are easily accessable and they encourage you to try things on, in fact, they even let you place your belongings in the bags to help you get a feel for how the bag is before you buy it.  There are also plenty of mirrors so you can see how great your selection looks before you purchase.  The store was very clean and organized.  I shopped there on a Saturday and it was busy but not packed.  I didn't have to wait long in line and my purchase was already bagged when I got to the counter.  In my opinion it is worth spending a little extra money on a handbag for the high quality/style and great customer service you recieve at Coach!  I always recommend this location when my friends are looking for that perfect handbag!~~#~1
One of the nicer zoos I've been too. I found the price to be very in line with what other zoos charge. I loved the nice, large enclosures. The way they were laid out I saw all of the animals, even going in the middle of the day. The enclosures are set up so that the animals can get out of the sun, but you can see nearly every part of the enclosure. I also like the way the sections flow naturally from one into the next. Water is free unless you're opposed to using a water fountain. They're located all over the zoo. Still, unlike many places, they allow you to bring in your own drinks and snacks. I didn't pay a dime for anything other than my ticket and didn't feel like I missed out on anything. Also, even though I'm only in town for a couple of weeks, I got a membership. It helps pay for the nice enclosures and you also get two free passes to bring friends, which I will use. Within a week, the pass will pay for itself and they have reciprocity with zoos closer to where I live.~~#~1
Such great service, atmosphere, and food! I went on a Saturday night. Thank goodness I made a reservation. The place is popular. My date and I ordered the number 42 and 44. Both were soooo yum. Their choice of side salads are great! The food was light and fresh. The cream sauce on my dish would be so good on a pasta lol. The service was great and they seemed to genuinely care about their customers. Can't wait to go back!~~#~1
Awesome metal sculptures and other great finds. Jewelry, art and wonderful tchotchkes. Reasonable prices, but finding someone to help can be a challenge.~~#~1
looove Mangos! one of the best things about mesa!~~#~1
Carina impressed me the moment she arrived! My dog, Jake, ran right to her. He left a scruffy little muffin. After only one hour, he returned a dapper little dude. His cut was done to perfection. After four plus hours at some of the other places, he returned with nicks, scrapes and an irritated bum. This was certainly not the case this time. We will definitely be calling COUTURE CLIPS next time he needs a trim!! Excellent choice!!~~#~1
I don't even like Greek food to be honest...That is until I had a gyro at Chicago Gyros!!The most incredible food I have ever had!!The portions are huge, and you definitely get what you pay for.Nice friendly staff, and food is delivered within 10 minutes of waiting!!~~#~1
Wow what an experience! My friend and I stayed one night here while attending a design conference in Phoenix (hotel is walking distance from conference center and numerous restaurants). The Palomar experience started when we pulled into valet and lasted till we checked out. Everyone was friendly and helpful and you honestly felt like you might just be the most important guest they had! The rooms were impeccable, the furniture had a modern aesthetic and even embraced a bit of my typography passion! Also a huge fan of the soy milk option at the morning coffee and tea bar! I will definitely be staying here again.~~#~1
Ok,, so I am not the type of guy to call a spa, set up and apt, and then make the effort to show up.. If I'm beat up from working, or from sports I can drop in and get an amazing massage and be on my way within an hour.  Price is great an the service is top notch.  Your girl might want the whole spa experience but this is quick, easy and you can even get massages side by side while you wait for your dinner reservation.  Great concept, Great Service, Great price....~~#~1
My cousin, Tiffany F, recommended this place as one of the local gems to check-out while in Scottsdale. Man, I am so glad we headed to this spot after her wedding bash. This place had absolutely amazing (hangover) food. I had to put a "little hair of the dog" and started off our visit with an Absolut Peppar Bloody Mary filled with yummy garnishes such as olives, lime, lemon, and cucs. I had such a hard time ordering and finding out what I wanted that Mom and I split a sweet and savory dish. We opted for the Blue Crab Benedict and the Peach Creme Brulee pancackes. Holy schnikes...it was amazeballs. Fresh grilled peaches nesteled between two fluffy pancakes with a creamy vanilla anglaise and fresh whipped cream. OMG it was delectable. The blue crab was fresh, sweet, and paired wonderfully with the creamy hollandaise sauce. It was perfection. My pancakes came with a choice of fresh fruit, DD hash, etc. I chose the DD hash (i.e. butternut squash perfectly seasoned); I, at first, was a bit concerned thinking it was corned beef hash. However, I was not that disappointed because the flavors of rosemary, paprika, and other flavors brought out the delicious flavors of the roasted squash.I definitely will go back to Daily Dose when I'm in town. It's nestled in Old Towne, which is a fascinating part of town.~~#~1
Usually when I visit my family in Phoenix it takes what seems like a lifetime to find a place to eat that is not the tried, true, and tired.  Eating at this modest restaurant was the culinary highlight of my trip to Phoenix.  I implore all Phoenicians to frequent this establishment and your taste buds will thank you.For starters, the chips were wonderfully light and not too oily.  The chips come with two different types of salsa.  A red salsa with a little bit of a bite and a green avocado salsa that is mild with just the right hint of avocado. I ordered the shrimp in garlic sauce and the dish was sublime.  The shrimp were sauteed with red bell peppers and onions.  The vegetables were cooked perfectly - not too soft and not too crunchy.  The garlic sauce was wonderfully sweet and garlicky.  I couldn't get enough of it.My dining companions both ordered the Camarones Culichi.  This dish is freaking amazing!  It consists of shrimp cooked in a green tomatillo sauce and loaded with melted Manchego cheese.  The sauce is divine and words cannot describe it properly.  The perfect accompaniments to these dishes were Mexican Coca-Colas (Yay!), creamy beans topped with cheese, and white rice with vegetables.  The tortillas were right on and looked to be homemade.Leave behind the comfort of the fancy pants restaurants that the trendinistas like to go to and try something real.  You will not be sorry.~~#~1
Yummy! A little bit of this and a little bit of that and a whole LOTTA LOVE! My belly and my heart were digging on each other;) The service is exceptional too!~~#~1
Great espresso, delicious baked-goods. Beware, though, you MUST order very slowly, and be sure to enunciate. And maybe ask the counter person to repeat the order back to you. Otherwise, you may end up with a bowl of oatmeal swimming in espresso. And delivered to your table 30 minutes after you ordered.~~#~0
I'm a big Liberty Market fan and way overdue on this review. I'm also a big Joe Johnston fan. Think he's a great guy & love that he's about great AZ food, drink, coffee & gelato/ice cream - and not just his own stuff.I've been to Liberty Market a host of times and enjoyed it each one. This past one, I went by for EVTM (East Valley Thursday Morning) and hung out with 40-50 friends & strangers.I ate breakfast at LM for the first time and it was stellar. I got the demi-breakfast (scrambled eggs, meatball & pancake) and a bowl-a-ccino. The giant bowl of cappuccino was excellent, as is all the coffee I've had there. It was quite pretty as well with a very nice pour. I thought the food was remarkable too - especially the scrambled eggs which were perfectly done (little bit soft) and the meatball (was hint of wonderful cheese in it - Parmigiano-Reggiano or something similar?). Super yum. While I thought the pancake was great as well, the other 2 were the standouts for me.I also love the decor & ambiance of LM. I love how casual it is and how easy it is to feel comfortable with your family & friends. I think the ordering mechanics lend to that - you order at the counter & take your number to a table of your choice.The building just reeks of character, with exposed brick and is beautifully decorated in kind of a retro vibe. The bathrooms are also very cool.In past visits we've also had the meatballs, the rancher sandwich and some of the pizzas, which were all excellent.If LM wasn't so far from our house, I know with certainty that it would be one of our regular haunts.~~#~1
Outstanding..unpretentious..and down right perfect customer service!This place is unbelievable! The smoked salmon is the best I have ever had! The rolls are delicious and the nigiri sashimi is perfect as are the sushi chefs!Did I mention the smoked salmon is the best I have ever had????  Put this place on your bucket list.....oh ya!!!~~#~1
This place has to be by far one of my favorites! The different types of meat are all great. You get great service and a good variety of meats. 16 different cuts!! Not to mention you also get to try the salad bar which has the best fresh salad that's all you can eat. Let's just say you'll definitely be full afterwards. If you're a meat lover like me  this place will be your heaven! :)~~#~1
Great Mexican food, cheap specials, friendly employees, bottomless chip and salsa bar, great location right next to lightrail.  Lots of seating options.  This is my favorite Mexican place in Phoenix.  NOTE: Avoid during lunch rush, because of it's location, it gets swamped, and there is a huge line for the salsa bar.~~#~1
Three awesome things about Picazzos in Tempe1) 100% organic food, and i mean the good stuff (pizza, pasta, salads and chicken wings)2) The food is YUMMY3) They have an awesome happy hour every day of the week where you can get 1/2 price appetizers and 1/2 price organic cocktails. HOLLER!!!~~#~1
Love it!  They make their own cheeses and use local produce and meats.  They also make wonderful ice creams.  If you're ever in the neighborhood or just in the mood for something fabulous, you should stop by!~~#~1
A group of us from my company went here during a regional meeting in Phoenix.  What a great pick.  Small place, but has been on DDD.  Most of us got pizza, but a couple also went for the pasta dishes.  I split the Italian Stallion pizza and the Chicken Pesto Lasagna with a co-worker.  Both were really, really good.  We also tried the stuffed shrimp and calamari for appetizers.  Shrimp were tasty, calamari was standard fare.  They were out of fried ravioli, but substituted some garlic bread for no charge.Staff was incredibly friendly. I think we had the owner's daughter for our waitress.  Food was made fast and delivered piping hot.  We did have to wait about 20 minutes for our table, which for such a small space and a group of 8 was amazing. Prices are very reasonable too.I will definitely return here on future trips to Phoenix!~~#~1
It's what they say: a culinary experience that is unique and goooooood and in the 'hood.~~#~1
Since moving downtown, Hanny's has become one of my absolute favorites! I love everything from the reclining booths to the crazy bathrooms. And even more, I love the food! My favorites are the Hanny's Salad and the Margherita Pizza. It's plenty to share and you'll enjoy every bite!The drinks are a little pricey, but they definitely don't skimp on the booze. Great for lunch, dinner or late nights!~~#~1
I had another fantastic meal at Durant's on Tuesday!  For me, Durant's the best steak house in Phoenix maybe in the South West! Excellent food and fantastic service, can't wait to go back!~~#~1
i literally eat the roof off of this joint.My girlfriend introduced me to Chino about 2 years ago. Since then i have probably eaten here about 20 times. My go to plate is jade red chicken, pork fried rice, black refried beans, and a machaca quesadilla (when i am feeling crazy i also order a pollo diablo burro).Somedays the food portions are larger than others and some days the food is better than others. I ate here last night and i was the best it has ever been resulting in a classic 5 star yelp review (shocked i haven't reviewed it already considering i'm addicted to chino).I have eaten at both locations but prefer the 19th ave location. The thing you gotta love about this place is how crazy it gets in there. You've got a crazy menu to order from, and a hilarious open area of plastic tables and chairs filled with people not really sure of whats going on. Theres kids running around climbing all over a giant panda while everyone is dying to hear their name called out so they can feast on a crazy mexican chinese infused plate of heaven.If you have never been don't be shy and get a few free samples from the sample area to the left of the register. I still have not tried everything on the menu but will venture off my standard go to plate one day.5 stars for sure and i love this place after a hard Sunday of tailgating/drinking at the Cardinals game.~~#~1
I'm either used to it or the smell is gone now. So this gets bumped up to 5 stars. Just a chill place.~~#~1
I'm going to take a break from my Yelping hiatus to talk about a relatively new venue that has become near and dear to my heart.  The Crescent Ballroom has become the single greatest concert venue in Phoenix.  Charlie Levy has become my indie god, as he's brought more concerts that I've been stoked about than I could ever imagine in such a short period of time.  The acoustics are perfect, the tickets are nothin', and you can get yo drink on with anything ranging from PBR to handmade gourmet concoctions.  Thank you Crescent!!~~#~1
Just ordered 5 pies for Thanksgiving. TERRIBLE!!! Crusts were so thick and raw. Pecan pie filling was so chewy it had to be thrown away! They have lost a lifelong customer! Mary Hedges~~#~0
great little shop.  visited Rage while in scottsdale for thanksgiving.  they have some nice stuff not normally stocked by your average LBS:  surly frames, salsa frames, all city, yeti etc.nice guys too.  they seemed to know their stuff.  pump track in the back.~~#~1
OMG!Love the vanilla honey latte, cold.And the pastries are bomb.And the CREAM CHEESE AND BAGELS ARE UNREAL!!!In order of our favorite CC:1) Three Bell Peper2) Jalapeno3) Green Onion4) Vegetable5) Sundried TomatoGiant Coffee bagels are sort of like Pokemon but instead of "Gotta Catch em All", you "Gotta Try em All!!!"Mmmmmmmmmmm, delish!~~#~1
I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet. The husband and I have been coming here for years now and it is still one of our favorite burger places. The Delux Burger is just fantastic with caramelized onions, blue cheese, and arugula. We always order Medium-Rare and it is always perfect. The burger is huge - we usually split and then order a basket of mixed fries. Their Sweet Potato fries are my favorite. Not a big fan of the regular fries, but the husband likes them. The fries come with some aioli sauce which is addictive. The husband also loves their Lobster Bisque soup and they make a pretty good Chocolate Malt Shake. Definitely check this place out if you are ever in the area! If you don't order dessert here, you can always head over to Gelato Spot for dessert!~~#~1
Amazing Garlic Chicken Wings.  Truly amazing.  This joint does not get any more humble.  The sign on the road merely says "Chinese Food" in both English and Spanish.  It doesn't even say Tams.  There are no tables.  It's literally a hole in a wall.  Get out of your car, walk up to the hole in the wall, place your order, wait 10 minutes, grab your goodies and drive away.  The menu has all the favorites you would expect  but you want to get the chicken wings. (Many different flavors available.. we got garlic).  They're part southern fried chicken, part chicken wing (you get the whole wing - not just 'paddles' and 'drums") and part chinese food.  Chinese Soul food indeed, and perhaps the best wings in town.  We also had the chicken egg foo young and it was superb.  The egg roll was big, thick and loaded with goodies.  It was also dripping with grease.... I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing.  Anyway, I ate all of it and it was pretty darn tasty.  Unless you're packing, I would go to Tams during daylight.  The neighborhood is tough.  Try Tam's.  It's amazing.~~#~1
You have to have a frozen thai mai from here! They are amazing. I also order the honey walnut shrip minus the mushrooms. The bartenders are amazing and always ask if i have a food allergy to mushrooms and will put it on the ticket. The bartenders are very friendly which is why ive never sat anywhere but at the bar.~~#~1
A cozy little gem of sushi restaurant in a strip mall. Felt comfy from the moment my hubby and I walked through the door and sat at table on a Monday night.Nice selection of sushi named in the menu, reasonable prices, very fresh fish, great quality, quick and attentive service and super tasty! Just had the basic scallop sashimi, volcano roll and shrimp with crab in soy paper roll. We enjoyed our meal immensely. Great selection of sake available as well.We will be back and be sitting at the bar.~~#~1
Great portion size, affordable, fresh, locally owned and no B.S. My girlfriend and I had just moved to the area and were looking for somewhere to grab a quick bite. We asked Siri and the the "Full Belly Deli" appeared on our phone. Tucked away off the side of the road, with no real noticeable features on the exterior we pulled in and I proceeded to have one of the best lunch experiences I have had in awhile. The prices are right, the ingredients are real and actually TASTE that way, and a grown man can get a 6 inch sub and actually feel full off of it rather than feeling like you you ate was a mouth-full of bread. Everything was great, simple and easy & I would definitely recommend them to anyone in the area.~~#~1
If you want a coffee house that makes coffee like its their own personal artwork, this is the place.  Great service, great atmosphere and most importantly, great coffee that is made how it is supposed to be made.on the comments about the .50 credit card charges...obviously these people have no clue how expensive it is to have a credit card machine and how much each transaction costs.  It is hard for mom and pop shops to survive in the world of greed lusting chains.~~#~1
We purchased our tickets well in advance and had our itinerary in hand for a round trip to and from South Carolina through Charlotte and Phoenix on the way home. To our horror an easy one hour layover turned into 5 hours at Phoenix. The original flight seems to have magically disappeared if it ever existed at all. This would have been acceptable if they had let us know they were changing our flight. They sent us a confirmation email before the day of travel and never mentioned the change. There were 4 flights from Charlotte to Phoenix, we would have taken a later one had we known and not gotten up at 2am to get that first one only to be stuck in the busiest airport I have ever seen. The sinister, evil part in all this is the Sky Mall, I think they intentionally delay people in these airports so you will spend money in their Sky Mall. WHO SHOPS FOR SUITS IN THE AIRPORT? My biggest problem in all of this is that they did not tell me about the change. People should do what they say they are going to do and if they cannot then they should inform the people involved. If you fly US Air be aware your gate will change, your flight may change. You will pay to check your suit case and you will pay through the nose to eat on the plane and in the Sky Mall! There will be no TV, no radio, no blankets on the the plane, and they WILL run out of overhead space for your baggage. You will save some money though. Happy Skies!~~#~0
After 3 visits, it's time for a review. But first, I just have to address some of the other, more negative reviews - 1. "The chalkboard is confusing" - No it's not. Find a beer you like the sound of, or the style, tell the server the number. Easy2. "The colours of the chalk hurt my eyes" - really? get some glasses.3. "It closes too early" - come earlier4. "It's too busy" - come later5. "I don't like craft beer" - don't come at all6. "I have to share my table, eeew" - unless you are paying their bill, what's yer problem? make some new friends.7. "It's too loud" - It's a bar, it's supposed to be loud8. "the parking lot is too small" - be thankful that there is a (free) parking lot. There is always street parking or you could ride a bike.9. "there's not enough bike parking" - chain it to a lamppost.10. "The beers keep running out" - it is a rotating selection, they are not running out, they are changing.11 & 12 "The beers are too expensive" - "Where is the Coors/Bud/Miller?" - I give up.The fact that this bar is so unique is probably why so many people are confused and write dumbass reviews. It takes them out of their comfort zone. It is for this very reason that I am giving it 5 stars. Most places are exactly the same as everywhere else and kudos to Angel's Trumpet for daring to be different.I love the beer selection, I love that I haven't heard of most of them. I also love the food. The onion and blue cheese quesadilla was amazing. The bison BLT in a blanket was a knockout and the avocado salad made my vegetarian girlfriend very happy. The service has been good all 3 visits.What really blew my mind during the last visit was the quality of the music. When a bar plays The Jam, Madness, The Specials, The Clash, Talking Heads, Depeche Mode, The Police, The Beat, I know there is someone in charge (even if only in charge of the music) with good taste.One suggestion - the chalkboard on the patio should be raised. It's too low when people sit at the table right next to it and difficult to read. Other than that one, very minor inconvenience, this place is unique and it rocks. I will be back for sure.~~#~1
I don't feel compelled to take time out of my busy life to write a review very often. When a company gets an online review from me they either provided REALLY bad service or they provided GREAT service. Sounds Good To Me is one of those rate companies that gets a GREAT review from me. The owner of this business, Dave, went out of his way to make sure that I was satisfied!One of the few car audio places in town that had the expertise to upgrade audio in my Porsche Boxster, they did a fantastic installation job. The equipment was high quality, the work was professional grade, and the service was affordable.What struck me was that three years later when I had a problem develop with my system the owner allowed me to bring my car in and they checked my system out for me. They went as far as to test everything and even fixed a loose connection. No sleazy sales jobs or false diagnosis, just honest and affordable service. These guys are true pros and I highly recommend them for your car stereo needs.~~#~1
I give very few 5 star reviews however I must say that this place is without doubt the most deserving.  The food is simply amazing as is their outstanding wine list and best views in the valley.  This place will satisfy the most demanding critic.  After a delightful dinner the wife and I spent several hours dancing in the lounge to live music classy music.  This place makes you feel like everyday is a honeymoon.  If you are looking for a place to impress anyone this is it.  Great Job Hilton.~~#~1
Ok so Im a resident here in anthem and me and my family go to this bbq place all the time! The family owned restauraunt is very cozy and smells amazing!

We love this place!The food is amazing and very well priced! Worth the drive wherever you are coming from.highly recommended!~~#~1
Great experience at humble pie thanks to Alex the bartender.   What a great time.  Alex made us feel welcome and suggested food, drinks while chatting .  He is the reason we will be going back and making it a regular favorite spot.~~#~1
I've been shopping at ON for years without a single problem. The clothes are inexpensive and I restock on a pile of tank tops every year. Recently, I had a huge issue with a large amount in a return not being credited to my acct. After 10 days and no credit, I went into the Desert Ridge location to get it handled. It turned out that the credit was processed incorrectly and never communicated to my bank. Kelli was the lucky one who "took my case." She spent some time on the phone and did some complicated data entry (seriously, it took 67 steps to undo the original error) and completely solved the problem. She was patient, professional, smart, and really determined. It was a lot of money and she recovered it for me, and I'm very appreciative.~~#~1
The staff was extremely helpful when I had troubles with my iPhone. The store is crazy-busy and they made sure my time mattered. I felt like my business was important to them.~~#~1
Was going to the Mesa arts center for a concert and needed somewhere to eat first and found this on Yelp.  Thanks Yelpers !  I would never have gone in without your recommendations !  Looks a bit dodgy from the outside, but really cosy on the inside.  We were seated at the bar as the place was so busy - a great sign.  Our waitress was awesome and gave us some great recommendations. I had mushroom and beef chimis in a mushroom sauce - it was unbelievable.  My partner had fish tacos.  We will be back for sure !~~#~1
Love this place.  The menu is varied and they will customize any dish for you.  They have great vegetarian options.  I love their  tofu and veggies.  I usually order the sauce on the side.  My favorite dish is tofu and veggies over fried rice.  The portions are large.  If you check the nutritional stats on their website most of the dishes are 2 servings, which is nice to know if you are counting calories, but not so nice when you know that you've chowed down the whole dish because it's so delish.  They also have a gluten free menu and a kids menu.~~#~1
My sister and I went to this Fry's today. This was my first visit to this location and last. My sister went into this Fry's to use an e-coupon that Fry's had sent her in her email. It was good for 40% off one home item which included furniture. She was after a Samsung 46" television that was marked $633 before the e-coupon was taken off an additional 40%. We first waited 20 minutes for someone to assist us in the electronics department. Then once the gentleman came to assist us after customer service had called for assistance two times. He told my sister that her e-coupon would work and she could indeed use it towards the Samsung television since to Fry's it was considered a "home" item. However, when he went back to the stock room to get her a television in the box- new. He came back out and said "ugh, I am sorry to tell you but all we have left is the floor model." Then why did he mislead my sister and I when we asked him if the floor model was the last one and he told us no. Then he dropped another bomb and told my sister that he checked with another employee when going to retrieve a television from the stock room that did not exist after all. That her e-coupon was not valid on a television after he had already clearly told her that it would work on the television because it was a" home" item.  I would not go back to this store EVER again. It lacks serious attentiveness to detail in it's employees and the employees need John Flora (Fry's president) to intervene and give the individuals at this store some more training! I would pass this Fry's unless you are ready for a hellish experience.~~#~0
WOW!Great place, with amazing food. Very nice outdoor patio.Started off with the stuffed mushrooms, which are stuffed with spinach dip, mozzarella, and sausage on top. OH SO GOOD!Pepperoni and Italian sausage pizza. Had great sauce and thin crust, I just wanted to dip the crust in more sauce, it was great. Fettuccine chicken alfredo... LOVED IT. Lots of sauce, lots of chicken. Match it all up with a glass of vino... you are all set to go. Our waitress helped us match a vino with our pizza. She was very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. We will definitely be back for more.~~#~1
Just had my first haircut here.  I've always been one to cut my own hair, hated going to those chain places and spending the money.  Just had surgery so I wasn't able to cut my own this time.  Choose Zev's do to location and the reviews here.  Excellent service, haircut, and price.  I really was in awe of the service, never expected so much from a barber shop.  I highly recommend this place.  I'll be getting my hair cut here from now on!~~#~1
Excellent food, great prices. Definitely check it out.~~#~1
What a great find! We were just driving through Phoenix on a Monday night and needed both food and a place to stay. We actually found this place via Yelp and were so glad we did. Not only did the waiter make great Margarita, guac (omg, yum!) and tacos recommendations (everything was de-li-cious), he also helped us book a room at the adjacent hotel (The Clarendon hotel) which was super convenient and hip. We got to relax in the pool and look at the roof-top view after dinner. Fantastic.~~#~1
Despite the name my girlfriend would not let me wear my Fez to dinner. Even without the fun hat it was a great meal.Walk in and you are greeted with a modern contemporary interior and a patio that has some of the best views of the light rail on central. The patio does have heaters for the 4 months of winter. The menu consists of salads, burgers, and some entree`s. We started with the full Marrakech salad 9.99. What was nice was the fact I split this with my girlfriend and they served it on two separate plates. This is great as it saves us from dropping a third on the table while we try to split; it also restricts my selfish nature and ensures my girlfriend gets some food. The salad itself was nice fresh spinach, orange supremes and a light dressing. Our mains consisted of the Veggie burger 9.99 with sweet potato fires and mixed greens and the apricot Salmon. 17.95. The burger was great, soft moist and full of flavor, the fries were crisp but it bit too desert like with the cinnamon. Our salmon was cooked perfectly, and the cous cous was light and fluffy. The apricot glaze was sweet but not overpowering.For desert we had the tarimsu. Again marvelous light decadent and nicely dusted with coco powder that I got on my sleeve. Service was great just as the food was.~~#~1
This place is a home run, plain and simple.  I've eaten here many times, from a duo to a Friday office lunch and it's yet to disappoint me.  Tamales, white pizza, red chile pork, it is really really all good!!~~#~1
Love this pizza! So good! Prefer to just get takeout here and bring it home.~~#~1
Had the tofu soup and the ribeye bbq at the table cooktop. The tofu soup was nice. The "beef" couldn't be eaten by humans, unless you had a built-in chainsaw in your mouth. The pork was nice, but the beef should never have reached our table. Awful.A smokey place (kinda fun there) that leaves you feeling like a Boy Scout just returning from a two week jamboree in the woods. Yeah, I remember that. Same thing. You might want to do laundry right after the dinner. I've been to a few Korean places in town and probably would not go back to this one. Yes, it's homey and mom and pop, but after that beef bbq attempt, uhhhhhh.....no. Not again.~~#~0
The best part about this place is going out back to smoke a cigarette.~~#~0
I travel to Arizona all the time and tend to end up at Mill Ave..... I have tried to go to The Big Bang and all I have to say is Classless. They think they are so pretentious. They kick you out if you seem to be having a good time but really they are just rude and the bouncers think that they are better than everyone in that place. They have a cover charge which i think is rediculous! I will not be going there...there are so many other great bars on mill that I can enjoy a drink with out feeling like they make me feel (Low Class)~~#~0
I  would never, never, never take my dog to get groomed there again.  I have a goldendoodle and I told the groomer to NOT shave her and only cut the matts out.  I wanted her to be long!!!!! When I picked up my dog she not only looked horriable they shaved all her hair off to the skin.  I cried when I saw her and I am sick about it.  Megan the groomer should not be grooming dogs.  She is just lazy and did not want to take the time to comb her out.   I have taken her to other groomers with the same amount of matts and they NEVER shave her!!!!!   I just asked for a shampoo and brush out.   NOT a haircut or shave.  My last words to the groomer were just cut them out and make her look cute!!!! My poor dog looks like it is dying!!!! She went from being the cutiest dog ever to being the UGLY!!!!! Please never take your dog to Megan at Lookout Mountain again.  LOVE the vets...Hate the groomers!!!.~~#~0
The last time I came to this place was over 5 years ago and they had good food and good service. HOWEVER, today was a different story. I wanted to take my best friend here for breakfast and here is how it went....actually it didnt go anywhere...we walked in and were greeted by a young man when 2 seconds later sam came over and they ignored us and started bickering in front of us. Then i told the guy we wanted to sit outside and he had to ask same which i didnt understand why considering the restaurant was nearly empty. As we were waiting for him to return, another waitress asked if we were being helped and at the point same and the guy were walking back to us bickering. Finally, we were being taken to the outside seating area when I heard sam mutter something. So rude. When we were finally seated, the table was dirty! WTF! it wasnt busy so i dont get WHY they had any dirty tables! So the guy who seated us was gonna go get a bus boy to clean it, we waited for about 10 minutes, when tito came and questioned my english. First off, I dont want to be greeted with "YO", I am not your homeboy, second, there wasnt enough people for us to be called "y'all". It was annoying, so when we told him NO we arent ready to order because our table wasnt cleaned off, he told us he was gonna go get someone else to do it. At that point, we were irritated and just got up and left. Looking at most of these reviews, I dont understand why management doesnt fix this service issue. All you have to do is hire servers that have high school diplomas and BAM! problem solved.~~#~0
This place is empty these days for a reason.It took almost an hour to get my supposedly medium-rare Kobe beef burger. I also ordered it with red onions, pickles, chipotle mayo, and on a whole wheat bun. The chef of the evening decided upon himself to correct my order while in the kitchen. I received a very well-done piece of mystery meat (it could have been dog meat at this point, the depressing char masking its true identity) with arugala and bacon on a white bun.I sent the order back, because for $15, I should be able to make my own culinary decisions. Shouldn't I?This time, twenty minutes later, I received again a burnt piece of tasteless meat (maybe they ran out of salt and pepper and couldn't figure out where to buy some?), but with the original toppings that I ordered. Well, aside from the bun -- that remained white.The meat also looked very familiar, and at this point I wouldn't put it past them to have just placed the patty under a heat lamp, went out for a few cigarettes, then returned the burger to me. But I'm also just a cynical bastard. I ate half of the burger before feeling like vomiting a little in my mouth, downed my water, paid (after hunting down my waitress), and left.If you want to pay this much for a burger, go to Delux instead. The quality at Blu Burger Grille appears to be extreme hit/miss.~~#~0
Streets of New York failed us miserably.My wife and I moved from Michigan to Chandler about two months ago. We had been occasionally ordering pizzas from Hungry Howie's or Papa John's, but after John Schnatter made some ridiculous comments about having to raise prices a whopping 14-30 cents because of the Affordable Care Act, we decided we should be ordering from local restaurants, preferably those that take care of the employees that helped build their businesses. For some inexplicable reason, Streets of New York decided not to do business with us.On a Sunday evening, I placed a very simple order using their web site, which is obviously handled by a third party. I ordered a 14" pizza with mixed bell peppers and pepperoni from the Ray & Kyrene location. The price was $21.50 plus tip. This is at least twice what I would have paid from one of the national pizza chains, but I didn't care because I was happy to support a local business. I received a confirmation email at exactly 5:30 pm that stated my dinner would arrive between 45 and 60 minutes later.At 6:40 pm (70 minutes later), I called the restaurant to inquire as to the whereabouts of my pizza. My wife and I were quite hungry at this point. The woman I talked to told me, without ever ascertaining my identity, that the driver was running behind but was on his way.At 6:49 pm (79 minutes in, now), the restaurant called me and I was advised again that the driver was running behind and due to the delay, I could not expect my dinner for approximately thirty more minutes. My patience, already stretched, was beginning to thin.At 7:21 pm (111 minutes after ordering), I again called the restaurant, this time to simply cancel the order. The woman who answered the phone asked me if I was sure that's what I wanted to do (I was) because the driver had just left with my pizza and would arrive soon. I told her I had been told that before and simply wanted to cancel, and she stated she knew the status of my order and again said that it was already on the way. Amused by this, I asked her to tell me my name, since I hadn't introduced myself earlier and she hadn't asked. She stammered a bit about looking through her orders and then put me on hold for approximately a minute. Another woman then picked up the line and introduced herself as Amber, claiming to be the manager, and asked how she could help me. Again, I told her that I simply wanted to cancel my order. Again, she claimed that the driver had just left with three or four pizzas and was on his way. What she apparently didn't grasp was that this had been claimed much earlier and Streets of New York had already lost all credibility, and furthermore I just didn't care. She offered to give me 20% off my next order; again, I explained to her that I didn't want 20% off another order and that price wasn't the issue, I just wanted to cancel. She asked me what she could do for me and again I told her to cancel the order and reverse the authorization on my credit card. She finally obliged me, releasing my wife and me from a nearly two-hour wait for dinner. We went to Five Guys for burgers instead.What should have been an enjoyable evening spent watching Netflix and enjoying a pizza from a local establishment was ruined by the staff's inability to make and deliver a pizza, or to provide basic customer service in the event of their failure. It is unlikely that we will ever again attempt to do business with Streets of New York given that we were ignored and repeatedly lied to by their staff.~~#~0

It only takes one, very negative experience to write an entire chain off, certainly this particular location.  The scenario: my house had JUST burned down.  When I say burned down, I mean done, toast, goner.  So, I am not in a normal state of mind, to say the least.  There is a lot of intense emotion going on inside of you when considering the things that are lost that are completely irreplaceable.  It was the middle of a very hot summer, we checked in.  One of the few things that I had managed to salvage out of my house was my desk top computer, which I brought into the room with me.  It smelled like smoke.  Not cigarette smoke, though, fire smoke.  Everything we HAD smelled like smoke, which wasn't much.  Anyway, I left my boys - teenagers - in the room while I went about beginning to pick up the pieces of my life and get things moving.  Can't stay at a hotel forever.  I was gone maybe half the day.  When I arrived back, the boys informed me that management had come into the room, demanding to find out whether anyone had been smoking in there.  Now, mind you, they didn't knock on the door and ask to enter, they opened the door with their own key without any notice whatsoever and barged into the room, apparently thinking they were going to find someone smoking cigarettes in there!!In reality, the smell was very feint and it certainly wasn't going to permeate the walls.  Regardless, it is pretty unreasonable, IMO, for management of a hotel to simply open a door without notice because they suspect something is going on in there.  I would also state that it might be kind of dangerous for them to do such a thing if they open the door with the "wrong" kind of person occupying the room.  That isn't me, I wasn't going to get violent, but I did get mad at them about it.  As I said before, I was already emotionally charged, finding out they had entered without even knocking on the door got me pretty mad, pretty quick, especially since I had informed the front desk upon checking in that yes, our house had burned down, perhaps there might be some smoke smell coming from us, we apologize.  The manager of the hotel eventually showed up - who DID eventually apologize - but it was too late.  It was inexcusable that they thought they could just go barging into a hotel room because they were "suspicious".  We left that motel and no, I will never go back.~~#~0
The homeless seem to want to use the restrooms here, so the rest of us have to find an employee and get one of their coins to gain access to the restroom.  Even worse, they changed the policy recently to open access with a stern reminder that if you don't keep the restroom clean, then they'll revert back to their old policy.  Great... the restroom saga continues....For a two story location they're a little short on selection in some areas, and there's a parking problem like there is for all merchants in downtown Tempe on Mill ave.~~#~0
The plastic in my pulled pork, overly dry hamburger for my daughter. The service was just nothing to write anything nice about.  I would suggest in the future if you like your food and wait staff sub par.  Too much to ask? I suggest if you serve plastic in the food maybe the manager could apologize, maybe even take that off the bill.  I'm still wondering where plastic would come from?~~#~0
Stopped in here around 6:30 on Saturday night after our movie got out. We asked to be seated outside and got a table quickly, although then we wished we had an umbrella because the misters were drenching everything. The host saw us scooting the table over to avoid the deluge and was nice about offering to help us out. After waiting for what seemed like way too long for some acknowledgement from our server, another server came by and offered to get us started with drinks. Our real server showed up later and introduced herself, brought us water and then scooted away! Even though we had been looking at the menu a good 15 minutes and were ready to order.So we waited.....and waited.......and waited. In this time I grew very impatient and realized that I had a whole wine rack at home and a fridge full of food.  We were deciding to eat out for the ambiance and experience and so far this experience was not worth my time or money. When she finally returned I had mentally checked out and told her we weren't hungry. She left our table as if she really didn't care anyway, and that first server, who wasn't ours came by to check on us and we said we'd take the check. Never been here before. Awful first impression.~~#~0

UPDATE: from the April- May 2010 APS newsletter: "The EPA has seen no data to support the claims these devices improve energy efficiency and reduce residential energy bills." and "These devices do not meet the  manufacturer's promises."Let me tell you what the KVAR unit is going to do for you. It will probably not lower your electric costs or ever pay for itself, but it will change how you feel about how much you pay monthly for your electricity. That's it, nothing more.Large commercial factories I have worked in that operated many 480volt 3-phase machines (drawing up to a hundred amps) would use banks of capacitors to reduce harmonics fed back onto the power lines, for which they were billed by the power utility. In all my training and experience it was NEVER expressed that a power line capacitor would reduce operating cost. (except for the billing of harmonics by the utility) There is also a filtering effect that has a small benefit on large residential electric motors.A capacitor is a device that stores potential energy. It is made of 2 metal plates separated by an insulator. A capacitor cannot store AC power only DC power. In an AC circuit, a capacitor acts like a filter or coupler, on a DC circuit they act as a temporary storage device.It is possible that using a capacitor on a residential power line may reduce harmonics created by electric motors, this could have a slight impact on the cost of energy, but there is no storage or recycling impact on electricity. Electricity (AC power) must be used as created. It cannot be stored for later use. When the power plant creates the energy potential onto the power lines, if it is not used then it disappears. Electricity (electro motor force) cannot be recycled. The actual beneficiary of using a capacitor on your home power line would be your neighbors and the power utility. Any savings from this $400 device would be likely in the realm of less than 10 cents per month.Use of capacitors on your power line could prevent you from using devices that communicate over the power wires, like some security systems, remote control systems, remote sound systems, etc.It is not possible to recycle electro motor force, this is the same rule of physics that makes a perpetual motion machine impossible. Once the power plant applies EMF to the power lines, it vanishes within a fraction of a second if not used. It cannot be re-used or recycled.If you believe the claims for this device, then you would also believe in fuel line magnets and putting tape over outlets to keep the electricity from escaping. May I refer you to other devices that promise performance improvements but rely heavily on placebo and suggestion but offer no real change:  powerbalance.com   or  fueldoctorusa.comThis review is about the device marketed on the radio, not about the company that installs them. I have never had any contact with the company.~~#~0
Very poorly run business and absolutely HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!   We had made a reservation for a Baby Shower to be held this coming Staurday afternoon at Chez Vous.  Invitations were printed and mailed to all the guests.  With the shower just a few days away, one of the hosts tried calling the restaurant to confirm the number of guests out of courtesy.  It was discovered that, after numerous phone calls and unanswered messages, Chez Vous was in fact CLOSED because the owners are away in France.  No one ever attempted to notify us!  The soon-to-be Momma's mother-in-law was able to reach the owner on his cell phone and he could care less that our reservation was completely ignored!  He made no appologies and did nothing to try and remidy the sitiuation.  What if we had showed up on Saturday with all 15 guests, gifts, desserts, decorations, etc.?!  We would have had no where to go!  Thankfully, Elements at Sanctuary on Camelback Mountain was kind enough to take our reservation last minute, but we still had to reach out to all of the guests to notify them of the last minute change.  I just cannot believe that a small business would treat their customers with such disregard.  I will NEVER spend my hard earned money at Chez Vous.  They just lost the business of every guest at this baby shower along with everyone in their network.~~#~0
first we had the guacamole which completely lacked acid and the tortilla chips they gave us were stale. i ordered a seared ahi tuna sandwich with arugala and an aoli. ok, it was not seared ahi tuna. it was like ground tuna with onions and parsley and what not. this was my first surprise. the bun was cold and the tuna patty was room temp. i am not a picky eater but i took a bite and had to spit it back out. it was so OVERWHELMINGLY salty. there was no other flavor but salt. it came with a side of orzo and wild rice which also, for some reason, was drenched in salt. the orso was over and the rice was under which made for an awful textural experience. i am in the restaurant industry and so this was the first time i have ever sent food back at a restaurant.~~#~0
We were shopping for  a new washing machine. We had been to Home Depot and were comparing. Lowes did have a better selection and their prices were in line with Home Depots.Good prices and good selection are great things, but they don't really count if you can't make a purchase. We had waited in the area for about 15 minutes then asked a Lowes employee for help, they said they would get someone. We waited another 15-20 minutes and no one ever came. Not sure if this was an off day for them or they were short handed. Whatever the reason Home Depot got the $450.00 sale they would have gotten had someone been there to help us.~~#~0
How this place stays in business I have no idea. Food is gross,  the place is empty all the time, small dishes, over priced. Service is totally crap. The parking lot  looks like a place one could get raped in. If you're handicapped you are screwed one parking space for the whole building. Pot holes everywhere, I can't believe they haven't been sued yet for the condition of the parking lot.~~#~0
Ugh. We absolutely hated our experience here. When we first arrived, the host (who was standing outside at a stand) called us "sir" and "madam," which I thought was a little peculiar but not in and of itself annoying. Little did I know that ~32 minutes later, we'd look back and think of his misplaced etiquette as the only positive thing about our dining experience at Dragonfly. The service was totally unimpressive, especially given that the restaurant wasn't at all crowded, and the $4 happy-hour-special Long Islands were more sour mix than alcohol, but what really turned us off was the overly sweet, sugary, and poorly-thought-out food. We started with the "Mill Avenue" appetizer sampler. The only real standout was the cream-cheese filled puffs (ironically, the least authentic item) - the other items, including the sauce, were just off. The spare ribs were dry, the paper wrapped around the spring rolls was tough (telltale sign that they hadn't been freshly made), and the sauces were watery and had no zest at all. We eagerly looked forward to our entrees but when they came and we tried them, we found ourselves wishing for the flavorless and subpar - but not disgusting - appetizers. My husband had the mango beef - I used to work at a Vietnamese fusion restaurant where this was featured on the menu, and there, it consisted of thinly sliced beef with tender pieces of mango and a oyster sauce. Here, it was fatty chunks of beef with underripe mango in a sickeningly sweet, sticky sauce mixed up with a bunch of unrelated "sauteed" veggies. My yellow curry chicken and shrimp tasted less like a complex curry and more like a meat and veggie mixture (think bad Chinese) tossed in a paper bag with a whole jar of curry powder. When the waiter came to clear our almost-full plates, he asked if everything was ok. Our philosophy is usually to say something in response to that question only if something is fixable (e.g., a meat can be redone to be less well-done). In this case, the whole restaurant concept seems to be centered on serving flavorless and poor-quality large portions to a university crowd they seem to think is un-discerning. With so much wrong, a complete overhaul would be necessary. And, so...we said "We're just full. Thanks!" and got the hell out of there!~~#~0
Holy bad service! Ran out silverware. Forgot order like 3 times. Food cold. Go elsewhere on a sunday morning.~~#~0
Good lord, why can't this chain get much of anything at all right?1. When I order something for a time over the internet, I expect that the food I ordered will be ready at that time. Its been a long day, a busy day, and to have my food delayed 10 to 15 minutes past when I was scheduled is a major inconvenience. I order online versus going in and ordering to avoid people, hassle and wasting my time. Yet somehow this concept eludes them and my time is not of a priority to them. 2. They put beef in the bottom of my girlfriend's dinner. Now with past girlfriends this might not have been an issue, but my special lady friend does not eat beef in any form. While this sucks for her, its more concerning to me. I have a massive and acute allergy to all fish products. If I would have eaten something that had a piece of fish or shrimp hiding in the bottom, I would have been direct to the hospital. As much as I might enjoy chain eatery Chinese food, its just not worth the risk for me to eat at a place that while touting "if you get it with veggies and tofu its going to be VEGETARIAN" and then have them mistakenly put meat in the bottom.Long story short, if you have food allergies or if you're in a hurry, I'd skip this place. The food isn't good enough to venture the annoyances of dealing with this place.~~#~0
I do not know why this is so highly rated.  My family and I dined here and none of the food was very good.  Mediocre at best.  I will not be back.~~#~0
If you want to be robbed go to Gammage. I went to participate on the Wicked lottery and lost. Therefore we were told that we could buy the remain tickets for 35 dollars plus 3 for handling. I got tickets which price used to be 82. I signed the voucher for $76 for 2 tickets "on sale". Funny enough I was given a voucher for me for $167. I asked and the girl told me that it was because of the system, but I would be charged $76. Days later my bank statement shows that they charged $167. I asked Gammage what happened and they now pretend that I did approved this transaction, and there is no way they could know I did participate in the lottery. GREAT SCAM!~~#~0
These are the facts of what happened to me after a visit to the Blue Martini.  Am I saying that these guys are crooks?  No.  Maybe it was just a coincidence.  Draw your own conclusion.I left the Blue Martini and forgot to cash out at the bar.  The next day while Blue Martini had my card in there possession, over $3300 worth of fraudulent activity took place.  When all of the dust settled and the bank rejected some of the charges I had lost roughly $2200 out of my account.  Luckily the bank took care of everything for me.I contacted the general manager, John Martin, and he adamantly stood behind his staff and his procedures for absolute security of cards left at the BM.  Yet when I asked for my card at the hostess station the next day, after all of the fraudulent activity had already occurred, the girl just reached under the hostess desk and grabbed a huge binder of lost cards.  It was obviously left unsecured, unlocked and who knows if it had been left unattended.Mr. Martin handled the situation fine and rebuilt some of the confidence I had lost in the place.  I inquired about having a party there for 20-30 people which would be in two weeks.  He said he'd have one of his team contact within two days.  Two days went by and no contact had been made.  After his failure to follow through, I secured another venue.  I contacted Martin a week after my initial inquiry about the party to ask why I hadn't heard back.  He told me he hired a new guys and then he became argumentative (but somewhat still professional) in his email, saying if I such an "extreme sense of urgency" I should've called.  I basically told him that I correspond via email so I have a record of how the situation goes.  It's the last time I'll deal with this company.  I will spread the word every chance I get also.Did I ever say they stole money from me? No, nor did i ever accuse them of it.  I informed him of what took place and asked him to look into it.  Did I ever ask for any kind of compensation?  No, I never wanted anything from these people.  I have the email to share with anyone who would like to see them.  This is why I use email and not phone calls John...Too bad, this place is 5 minutes from my house.~~#~0
After pursuing my fellow yelpers reviews of Maria Maria my friends and I decided to give it a shot......I figured everything would come out on 1 side of the 50/50 split but my opinion ended up being exactly the same as the overall consensus here!  Service......Maria Maria was 1 step BELOW the worst service I've had in the last 5 years.  Is it wrong of me to tell you our waitresses name so you can AVOID her?  It was pretty clear she was just there for the paycheck and couldn't give 2 s*its about our experience.  Our water glasses were more empty then full, had to ask for refills on chips, appetizers came out literally at the same time as the meal, WE GOT ID'd (just a mini annoyance...) Allow me to go on.....my friend with a sensitive stomach asked if her enchilada's would be spicy and the waitress told her no......lets just say she could only consume a bite before she was done!  When she told the waitress she actually asked if she could bring out some sour cream.   HELLLOOO??!!  The food.....was actually pretty good.  Nothing amazing, but better than the local taco bell.  You could probably get the same thing at an On The Border Chain for about $50 less.  EVERYTHING was totally overpriced, including the drinks.....$10 for a margarita?  Atmosphere....seemed really cool until we realized it was actually about 84 degree's inside.  I am not exaggerating, there was sweat beaded on our bodies!  (ew!)  We asked why it was so warm and our waitress made a face and agreed before she "remembered" they were a green restaurant and hence were conserving energy.  HIGHLY suspicious however when at 7pm the lights dimmed and the A/C came blasting on (aka when energy rates decrease....coincidence? I think not!)  NO offer to move outside under the misters or to a different table, even after I mentioned I was worried the projection tv was going to give me a headache.  VERY sports bar in a otherwise classy placeAll in all 4 out of 4 people agreed we would not return to Maria Maria anytime soon.  I would recommend it for a sunday cocktail if you can tolerate the heat, or if you happen to WORK at tempe marketplace I would suggest the chicken chopped salad.  (Which wasn't chopped btw, but was delicious......for $14 bucks)   TO-GO!~~#~0
I was disappointed with my visit this past Saturday. I'm generally a huge fan of Fox Restaurants, but this one fell short. We made a reservation for about 13 people and ended up waiting almost 30-45min past our scheduled reservation time to be seated. Once we were finally seated, then came the ordering. With me being on such a strict diet, I was a bit skeptical about finding anything on the menu. I ended up ordering the Blanco Chopped Salad. which on the menu is described as "Grilled Chicken, Seasonal Fruits, Pepitas (pumpkin seeds)" for $9. Sounds tastey right? Well before ordering it, I did ask the server if the 'salad' had lettuce in it, and he assured me it was lush mixed greens with mixed fruit, chicken, pepitas and a cilantro lime dressing. "Perfect!" Well that's not what I got.Apparently mixed seasonal fruits meant just apples and there was tomatos chopped up in it. Now understand, tomatos are considered a fruit, but when you read seasonal fruits, a tomato is the last thing on my mind. They were totally reaching there. And when I read fruits, I'm assuming more than 2. FAIL.Needless to say, I came in with no expecations and walked away completely disappointed. I usually try and make one more attempt to go back to make a confirmed judgement, but this first visit literally left a bad taste in my mouth. I won't be going back.~~#~0
This is about the saddest little kiosk I've ever seen. Stranded in PHX, three hours on the way to Cabo, and four hours back, I had enough time to browse four gates of culinary options. Although there was one CPK ASAP that actually served pizza, there were a few that were downright pathetic, so small they only housed a fridge stocked with drinks and salad. Isn't serving pizza the whole point? Apparently not always.My girlfriend and I did have pizza at the CPKASAP that served pizza. There was a bit of a wait, the seating area was pretty dinky, and the pizza, aside from the BBQ chicken toppings, tasted to me just a half step up from Pizza Hut, which also infests this airport. Sure, beggars can't be choosers, and with limited options, CPK may be as good a bet as any. But it may do yourself some good to keep your expectations very, very low.~~#~0
They were the only airlines that fly from PHX to Long Beach so I had to buy a ticket from US Airways.  I was so excited to go to CA for one of my BFFs wedding shower.  2 days before my flight out, I did not feel well.  I went to urgent care and found out I had bronchitis.  I called the airlines and they told me that the change fee is $150 for tickets that cost less than $140.  I mentioned to the agent that the change fee is more than my ticket, she said "OH it is cheaper for you to purchase a new ticket." and snickered.  WTF!  Really, snickering at a customer?~~#~0
I made the mistake of going here on a whim. Awful, shitty bland Mexican food. A waste of money and my butthole was angry with me.~~#~0
Upscale Mexican Food?  Give me break.  From a veteran restaurant worker, the place smelled like a dirty, soggy mop.  Here's a tip, change your mop heads!  And what's with the twangy country music being pumped through the restaurant?  And meat-head bartenders, stop talking about your "girlfriends" and your weekend and get me another beer.  So many questions, few answers.  OK food,  cool new restaurant, never again.~~#~0
NEVER AGAIN! We went at 8:30 on a Friday night. We were seated & drinks were filled once. They said they were closing at 10, however they were too busy closing to run the restaurant. The food was cold & old. No new food was placed out while we were there. The person who was supposed to be our "server" was eating ice cream & the "hostess" was eating at her station, so we bussed our own table. While at the buffet, an annoying employee was trying to get me to eat the last of several differ dishes, I assume so she had less to clean up. What a waste of time & money. Thumbs down. Negative 5 stars. Don't eat there!!! In n' out is in the same parking lot!!! Just sayin.~~#~0
What?  LOL, this place is HELL.  Back in my hometown of Chicago, this is where all the My-New-Haircut-Guys would gather to act like they had culture because they were slamming Sake-Bombs and butting chests together.I had a taste for sushi, it was on my way... I peeked inside and thought to myself, "This can't be as bad as it looks."  Oh, yeah it can.  Note to the owners:  no, you cannot have BOTH a hip little sushi restaurant AND a sports bar.  It's loud, it's crowded, I had vegetable maki and it STILL smelled like old fish.  It's cheap, I'll give them that.  But if I had to deal with this place again, a chop stick would end up going through a baseball cap and into a skull.~~#~0
I'm on the hated-it scale of the Honey Bear love fest.  We ordered the bbq ribs and a beef sandwich with cole slaw and cowbro beans on the side.  Thought the meal was on the below average scale for tastiness...the beef sandwich meat suffered from not being marinated, and it was bone dry...the bbq rib was more of the same...so this would have been a 2 star review...BUT what pushed it down to 1 star for me was that my ribs were "bloody"...No not pink, but actually bloody with the jelly-like texture of raw meat...great when I'm eating sushi, but not so much for bbq porkI actually returned the bloody thing to the counter person who agreed that it was bloody and made me a new plate...unfortunately, it was a new plate of the same bloody ribs, I gave up and just trashed the bloody plate....so no, I won't be back for another tryIf you're looking for tasty bbq sandwich...try TEXAZ for lunch...that's where I'd be the next time I have a craving~~#~0
I attempted to bring in my Can Am Spyder in for service at the Surprise location. When I attempted to make an appointment I was told I needed to wait next to my bike outside the door while 2 other customers walked right in and were taken care of by the service writer. After waiting for 20 minutes, I reproached the service writer and told him I needed some electrical wiring looked at. He said that the earliest appointment would be Friday, 3 days later before they could look at it.When it was dropped of Friday morning they said they would try to hook up the diagnostic machine to the bike that day. Long story short, they didn't get around to it until Tuesday afternoon. I received a phone call to go to their shop to discuss the matter. While at the shop I asked the service writer to look up the VIN because I wanted to see all the service done to the bike and had some additional questions. The service writer stated that he could not access the records of other Ridenow locations. While I was calling around to other Ridenow locations, he took one of the record receipts and "magically" pulled up the entire history of the Spyder. I was told I would have the bike back in my possession between 3-4 pm. By 630pm there was no phone call. I phoned Wednesday morning and asked if my bike was done. After a brief time on hold I was told I could come pick it up.I decided to get a second opinion from a different Ridenow location, this time at the Phoenix location (Cave Creek north of Bell). I called ahead and advised the service writer I'd be bringing my bike it before 11am, the same morning after picking it up from the Surprise location. After giving him all the information over the phone, he (Adam) stated that he'd have all the paperwork ready by the time the bike would be dropped off. When I arrived to the Phoenix location, not only did the service writer have all the preliminary paperwork completed, BUT he also stated that there was a recall part to the bike. In addition to the electrical work I needed fixed, THAT AND the recall part were fixed and I had my bike back in 3 hours.I was extremely impressed and satisfied with the customer service at the Phoenix location. The Surprise location, even through it's 4.5 miles from my house will not see me in their service department or probably their store for a very long time. I was lied to by their service writer and would recommend to anyone who doesn't mind enjoying a little longer ride on their bike to give their business to the Phoenix location.~~#~0
We went in seeking help and advice about a few things and received none. All we received were dirty looks and rude comments from the employees....I will not be wasting money or time here that is for sure.~~#~0
I love sushi, pure and simple. I did not love this place even though I love the concept. If you are a sushi fanatic and want fresh, melt in your mouth fish, this is not the place for you. I had three different sushi dishes - tuna, salmon, and whitefish - all the fish was dry and tasted the same. My husband picked up four different rolls - Hawaii, Dragon, Spider and Crunchy Spicy Tuna - with exception of the sauce, they too tasted the same. We thought the seaweed "nori" wrap was very "chewy" and tasted funny. The gyoza and the Inarizushi (stuffed tofu skin) were actually the best things we had. Service was friendly and efficient. I like how you know the price of the item by the color of the plate it is on.  It is kind of like a reverse cafeteria. Instead of going through the line, the line goes to you!  Among the typical offering like sushi and rolls, they also have desserts (tiramisu, cream puffs, cheesecake), jello and fruit salad.Think, and then think again, before you trek here. Weigh the choice . . . price vs. quality. The price was right, the quality wasn't.~~#~0
This restaurant chain location is special because it is one of the few with adequate parking.  I'm sure it must have been an accident.  Just go to the Camelback, Scottsdale Rd, or Tempe locations to see the norm for this.This location has run out of the Four Peaks draft beer on several occasions that I have arrived.  They offer their own house brew and their servers are completely ignorant concerning what style it is.  Their impromptu attempts at describing it are often contradictory, and nobody here knows this difference between an ale and a lager.The wall paintings aren't as nice at the Shea location as others, but they seem to have a better turnaround and slightly less wait time than some of the other locations.  Maybe it is because people give up on the wait list and go next door to the other pizzaria?This place is all about the image - the atmosphere, colorful menu, and silly T-shirts.  Food is pretty much average and bears little resemblance to genuine Chicago fare.~~#~0
America's Taco Shop was a complete disappointment.  We heard rave reviews and decided to try it.  The taco was skimpy and the meat was flavorless, $3 for Mexican coke is too much.  The menu was very small so that's ok if the items are really good but they weren't.  Very surprised this place has the good reviews it has.  I have had better tacos at places I would not ever return to.  I wished this place would improve because I want to continue supporting local businesses.  Service was OK.~~#~0
They keep deleting my post, but I am just going to keep reposting it :)  Not the kind of person I want to give my money to. Did not present a coupon in the correct format so I was told I couldn't be helped. Owner was rude and did not seem to care. I would rather pay more at a store that is happy to serve me.( I got the stuff I wanted online for less and got great service to boot! )~~#~0
Are you Fucking kidding me!  You did NOT leave a disconnect notice on my fence for a non payment of $49.57.  Hold it, let me check that again.  Oh yes you did!  For a mere $49.50 are you kidding me!?  You Mother Fuckers!  I Fucking hate you!I'm sorry I didn't get your Damn bill ... I practiclly never pickup my mail because all my bills BUT yours are auto paid.  My mailbox is nothing but a heaping pile of junk mail and your F'n bill.  And no I'm not going to let you automatically deduct from my account.  I don't trust you, not even a little.  And no I'm not giving you my e-mail address.  I have no doubt you'd sell it to some spammer in Burma for a penny!And no I am not calling your B.S. payment line in India and then call you back with my payment confrimation number!  You can go to Hell!  You'll get your damn $49.57 when Wells Fargo get it to you, you bastards!  And if it weren't for Yelp! I'd proabaly go off the Damn grid just to spite you Fuckers!  Assholes!~~#~0
We have been buying tamales here for a few years.  The last two years we have ordered for Christmas eve dinner.  We put in an order so we can be sure to have them because they apparently run out.  We called several days before Christmas this week to order and was told " we are not taking orders"  and was told we could come in Friday or Sat. to pickup.  My husband went in Fri.  to get the tamales and was told they don't have any becuase of orders!!!  Are you freaking kidding me?!  Now we have no tamales for Christmas eve dinner. Dinner is ruined and it's too late to get anywhere else.  I will not be buying anymore food here for personal or for business.  Also I will be telling everyone I work with.  Horrible service.~~#~0
Poor customer service.  They don't seem to care about their customers, from doormen to management.   I was excited to get some real night life in Mesa, but this was just a disappointment.~~#~0
Wow. This place sucks.Honestly, don't waste your time. The food is overpriced. The service is awful. I hate the parking structure. It's just a mess. A hot mess.How are they staying open?My arnold palmer was $2.50. The tea was flavored and tasted really gross with lemonade.We split the house salad which was obviously the prepackaged spring mix from Costco (or Sysco -- whatevs) Then we split a medium pesto, tomato, and basil pizza. The tomatoes were not ripe, the sauce was bland, and the pesto was non existent. And then the 30 pine nuts that were smashed into the cheese were overkill.The crust was fair.The server took my plate before I was finished and then set it back down after she realized my fork was in my mouth.So for two teas, a house salad, and a medium pizza our tab was $22 ??? Costco Pizza would have been better.Bleh.~~#~0
I must be one of those "chumps" because I just ate here 30 minutes ago and thought it was terrible. First off, the parking situation is ridiculous. I drive a long-bed crew cab truck so it's not like I ever expect it to be easy, but WTF? They have spaces facing a wall, which are easy to get to, but then have more spaces behind those for parallel parking and there isn't room for a go kart to back up when someone uses those other spaces. When you go inside it smells incredible, but when you get your food it just smells like pure butter. I am not even sure why I ate my dinner. It was a mix of ingredients that just didn't work. I had a carne asada burrito, probably not their specialty, but read enough of my reviews and you see thats almost all I eat. It was almost half beans, then a bunch of guacamole, and some very tasteless meat. It was a cardboard/bean/avocado burrito. The tortilla had so much damn butter on it that it tasted like a butter stick. I'm not looking forward to seeing my cardiologist report after this. Probably the one redeeming quality I see is the little 11 year old girl that was the cashier/order taker actually spoke english. The rest of the staff were not bi-lingual, and while they don't need to be, it seems funny that the entire menu is in English. I have no problem saying carne asada, but why type "grilled steak" on the menu if you don't want me to order it that way?~~#~0
I have been going to Switch pretty regularly for several years and always found it to provide good food, a nice atmosphere and a great value.  Tonight, however, I was severely disappointed.  I was quite hungry, having eaten very little during the day, so the choice for me was between two of their more substantial meals:  either the short ribs or the Amsterdam Pasta.  I had eaten both in the past and had favorable recollections of them.  When asked, the waitress, hands down, recommended the Amsterdam Pasta, so pasta it was.  What a mistake!When it arrived it was already cold around the edges--a sign that it had sat out for a while before the waitress got around to bringing it to my table (oh, did I mention the slow service?).  Instead of the creamy white wine sauce I was expecting, I got a watery, oily mess.  Pasta, vegatables and chicken literally swimming in a half inch of oil.  And the garlic was so strong you could ward off a whole room full of vampires!  On top of that, nearly all the asparagus spears were the tough bottom halves that should have been cut off and thrown in the garbage.  Nothing is more disgusting than having to pull food out of your mouth and pile off to the side because it cannot be chewed.  There were about 8-10 piled up by the end of my meal.Had I not been so famished and pressed for time, I would have sent it back.  But that would have meant trying to catch the attention of my missing-in-action waitress.  I had already waited over half an hour after ordering and was unprepared to wait another similar lenght of time.  The pasta was edible and the chicken was edible, but the asparagus was put into a half-chewed pile while the remaining vegetables were left to float in the greasy pond at the bottom of the dish.When my waitress finally came back around near the end of my meal, and I expressed my disappointment, her response was pretty much, "oh that's too bad; did you leave room for dessert?"So, let's do a tally here:  bad food, mediocre service and lousy attitude.  0 for 3.Given my previous, good experiences at Switch, I am willing to give it another chance.  But I fear that, after a successful run, my experience tonight may be a sign that the place has started its decline.  I will be seeking out alternatives.~~#~0
I wish I understood from what brain abnormality I suffer that leads me to keep returning to TGIF.  We ordered take out last night, i had the 'prime rib' Stroganoff and my wife had the 5 cheese macaroni.  I've eaten microwave meals that tasted better and what 'chef' employs lasagna noodles for anything but lasagna?  For $9.99, it was barely edible and my wife's mac and cheese turned out to be grilled chicken topped in with some bacobit/blue cheese obscenity; hell not even the wings were that good and they're usually the best part.  How do they get away with charging people money for this? Because morons like me continue to eat there.In all honesty, my wife and I had were very tired and hungry and TGIF was a block away.  Next time, I'll jump in the car and take my chances with one of those re-fried hot dogs at the local 7Eleven.~~#~0
Gross late night subs delivered by a nice sketchy crew of degenerates. The meatball sub is made with tasty frozen meatballs from the store, and they taste like shit. Cookies are prepackaged and are probably from 2005. Delivery can take a long long time, and don't expect change from your driver. Late night dining needs to be better than this.~~#~0
If you value your privacy, this is a place to avoid.  This place offers NO privacy, even though I was told to sit down while filling out my forms due to privacy.I went in for a sinus infection - I don't live in Phoenix but I was working here - and showed up at 8am along with two other people.  Of the others, one was there due to a work injury and the other was trying to scam an Oxycontin prescription.How do I know this?  The walls between the examination room can't be thicker than a human hair.  I had my intake done (heart rate, blood pressure, etc) behind a curtain, and instead of having me fill out a form detailing my health history, I was required to recite it.  After some VERY personal questions (it's my sinuses, NOT my plumbing!) the interviewer asked if I have a health power of attorney or a living will.Um... just how bad IS the service here?Then I was put in an exam room with plywood for walls.  Grimy ones, with a thin verneer that hasn't been washed in a LOOOOONG time.  At that point I first got to listen to the fella who had the work injury and the guy who insisted after having an accident four months ago (!) he was still in pain and needed... y'know... something a little stronger... than, well, Vicodin.  Uh, huh.  The doctor, who was quite nice, gave the junkie a prescription for naproxen sodium (Aleve).  Bummer for him.After seeing me, he not only gave me the antibiotics I requested, he gave me a prescription for the pain that contains codeine (??  What's that about?), Flonase (for a cold?) and a cough syrup (I don't have a cough).  Whatever.Bottom line:  there has to be somewhere better than this.~~#~0
The one star review is because having to wait in the heat totally ruined the whole meal. Seeing there were over 600 yelp reviews, I was expecting to wait. However, if you are successful enough to have a long wait for your restaurant, you should provide something to keep the waiting customers cool. Misters maybe? Maybe expand to have a foyer? We waited in the 100+ heat for 40+ minutes. They have a list outside you write your name on so no one is there to tell you how long your wait will be. They provide minimal seating and no misters. There's some ice water with oranges to drink with tiny dixie cups (the kind the dentist provides to swish with). By the time we had our pre-order (where they take your order 10 minutes before they seat you so you don't take up a table too long), I wasn't very hungry and definitely didn't want hot eggs.  After finally getting seated, we immediately have hot plates set down in front of us. I ordered the BLT (again, I did NOT want eggs when I was so hot!) and it just wasn't that good. Way too much crusty bread that scratched the roof of my mouth. The three people I was with ordered scrambles and said they were nothing they couldn't get elsewhere. The bacon and the waffles were very good. The wait staff was very friendly and apologetic but it's not their fault and there's nothing they can say to make up for being terribly uncomfortable.~~#~0
I have been there several times and have now sworn off this place.  Like other reviewers, I think the county board of health should take a close look.Should you touch salt or pepper shakers, you will definitely stick to them - They get refilled but never cleaned.Yes - I have seen a cockroach or two.The 5 gallon ice cream tubs open to all is less than appealing as you kind of wonder what else has been introduced into those tubs.While the presentation is generally ok, I suggest avoiding this place.~~#~0
Hmmm maybe I don't know the drill here in AZ, but this place is debit/cash only???~~#~0
Atmosphere was funky.  We went last week, with two gift certificates from Sunflower Markets.  When our server finally came with extra sighs and huffs of over-work blithering. Before greating us looked at the gift certificates sitting on the table and said 'you can't use those both here'--it's the rules of the owners.  So I asked are we allowed to split checks at a table--'no'.  We can't really comment on the food...the staffer was so rude about it, that we actually walked out.(We have tried the location at PV Mall...we had a great experience with the atmosphere and server...food was okay: salad-good, GF pizza-below average.)~~#~0
I recently went to the Camelback Inn with my family for dinner.  We sat outside on a Sunday night at Rita's Kitchen.  The restaurant was a ghost town minus one really cheesy guitar player.  The service was horrible.  Usually for a Marriott, you would think that the service would be great, but we were all so disappointed.  My past experiences with Marriott have always been good.  Our server was not put together and looked disheveled.  We asked for a cup of ice probably about 10 times and then we just gave up.  I ordered the Iceberg Chopped salad.  The rest of my family ordered steaks.  We waited way too long for our food.  My salad was so gross, smothered in ranch dressing, there was no color on the plate besides white ranch.  It was absolutely disgusting.  The steaks were also atrocious.  All of us had such a miserable experience and would definitely not recommend this restaurant ever.  It was all extremely overpriced for what it was.  A complete waste of money.  We will never go to this restaurant again.~~#~0
Very disappointed. The menu looked great and we were very excited to try some delicious Cuban food. Sadly the menu was the only thing right about this place.The first time we tried there wasn't a single parking spot in front, around the side or in back. The location isn't worth the rustic charm it's going for if no one can park.The second time we got a parking spot by the dumpsters in back! Luckily we happen to be forgiving when it comes to delicious food so we put that aside. The place is dying for a makeover inside but I'm a sucker for holes in the wall so that's not going to stop us. However, what will stop us is horrible service on top of all of this. We tried to flag down our waiter for over 20 minutes because our water was out and we wanted to order. Instead he had some very important socializing and scratching to do with the other staff that was doing nothing. When we got up to walk out it didn't even phase them.A small place, like this, can stay alive on delicious food but you have to feed your customers for this to work.~~#~0
This place gets one star.Why?Because of the proliferation of snotnose owners.That's why.Classic Phoenix ridden Children of The Corn mentality.They don't know you?You're not welcome.Hostile,rude,obnoxious,condescending group of assholes who congregate in their asshole pods to size up the new entrants into the park.Gods forbid your dog goes to play with any of theirs either.Between the nasty remarks,dirty looks and them pulling their oh so hi falutin mutts away when play does ensue,I find it a dissapointment at best to have to take dogface here.I have never seen this level of anti social behavior anywhere else in the world.This dog park's overall mentality is a prime microcosm example of what I despise about Phoenix.~~#~0
Corbin's has been a disaster from the beginning, literally.  I anxiously waited for their opening day, even with such enthusiasm that I dropped by to get a menu prior to my first dining visit.  I made a visit shortly thereafter only to find that their official hours weren't the same as indicated on the menu.  Big mistake.On later visits, when I was able to eat here, the food was interesting in that it was non-traditional on many accounts, and had good presentation, but was very lacking in taste.  Service was poor, staff was snooty, and I could have sworn that those were 10 ounce mugs used for draft beer at happy hour.  Even if they were 12's, come on, the norm is 16 oz. pint or larger these days.~~#~0
This location is the WORST! I love 3p's pizza but I can't stand this location. If you complain about the service to a manger they will tell you flat out that you are wrong!~~#~0
Went with the lowest expectations and wasn't disappointed. Not a fan of buffets or of fried foods or fatty foods.  The clam chowder was ok. The salads were ok.  No alcohol here.  The hot fudge dispenser at the desert bar was empty.  I was buffeted about by annoying fat ill-mannered  mouth-breathing children rooting around  at the troughs unaccompanied by adults.  I think I now fully comprehend why it's called "buffet".  I would rather have root canal than return to this place.~~#~0
I signed up specifically to review this hotel. I have been staying at the Pointe hotels since I was a child. My mother had her wedding reception dinner here nearly 30 years ago. It's not the nicest resort in town, but it's usually a good value and always fun for all.That being said, 7/8/2010 will be the last stay for any of my family  at either of the Pointe resorts. First of all, I booked a two bedroom casita in March and prepaid for it so it would be a reduced rate. It ended up being $20 less then the actual rate but oh well! At least I had the security of knowing I had the room.Living in Arizona, summer birthdays are not always easy- it's so hot. It has been our tradition to celebrate my birthday and now my daughters birthday at the Pointe Resorts. The staff has always been accomodating to guests and making us feel special. Yesterday was Cassidys 2nd birthday. We booked the casita specifically so we would have room for both grandmas to stay and a little room for some family and friends to enjoy Cassidys birthday. When we arrived- my pre-booked casita was not available. They told me I had only booked the queen one. I found the confirmation and they realized they were in err. "Ok, that's indeed what you booked, but We don't have one available right now. They are cleaning the downstairs portion of the casita but you may enter thru the king entrance and we will let  you know when it's ready."Well, at least I have the room right? So we decide to do this. When we unloaded all of our belongings and entered the open portion of the casita, it was cramped to say the least. But at least it was cool. But there were 6 of us with some other family on the way. I asked the maid to put my cake in the fridge downstairs. I got a glimpse of the downstairs portion and was in shock. Someone had a major party on there the night before- like furniture overturned, bottles everywhere, sticky floors- an absolute disaster. No way would these two poor maids get this cleaned up by 5. I vaguely remember the front desk guy saying the guests who were there had a late checkout. Yea, I see why;)We call the desk and to my surprise, we were moved- to a 2-bedroom casita right across the way!  But why not in the first place? Before we'd unloaded our things, etc. But the front desk did say they would help up carry our things across the car port. And that we were closer to the pool! Wow! Super nice bell boy came and helped us out. We were settled by 5:30- but that hour and a half of unsettlement for my daughter was not good. If you have or have had a two year old you know what I mean;)When my husband called the desk this AM- we wanted a late checkout and maybe just an apology,he was given the run around by a very rude manager. They didn't do late checkouts(HMMMM) Did we want to stay another night in a suite room for $69? LOL at that(they had a coupon for next stay in a suite room for $79.)  I got on the phone and told him the same story I've just told and he laughed at me several times and mocked me when I said I am a service manager at a large corporation and I usually don't complain. He mocked me about having children. His tone of voice was sarcastic. He was absolutely awful. He said that the GM was too busy to help us and wouldn't be available to talk. They also charged us for phone calls when we had paid for the value pack. Including the long distance one when I asked him for the corporate #. And do they not have a 1-800#? I didn't expect much, but I don't expect to be laughed at.Absolutely unacceptable. I see in reviews on here and trip advisor they have service issues. The water park was dirty and unattended to. Service/Food in park. -so so. I used to love this place and I'm sorry that a tradition is over. Oh well, I'll go to the AZ Grand next year. Don't stay here.~~#~0
I'm a big fan of family owned restaurants, especially ethnic, so you can only imagine my excitement when I found a Peruvian restaurant here in the desert.  Sad to say, this is one restaurant I will not be returning to.The food was bland and lacked flavor.  It almost like they ran out of "ALL SPICES" right before we ordered (yes including salt and pepper).  To start of we ordered an appetizer, the Papa a la Huancaina, sliced boiled potato served at room temperature covered with a cold, bland, bright boldish yellowish colored hollandaise/mayonnaise sauce. Let's just say it was a start to a bad meal.For the main course we ordered the Lomo Saltado, generous chunks of beef sauted with onions, tomatoes, and potatoes which sad-to-say was probably the best dish we had.  The dish was uninspiring, something you could find at a sit-down chain restaurant.   Nothing about the dish screamed Central American flavors.We also had the Jalea, a combination of breaded octopus, shrimp, and chunks of fish fillet topped with a Peruvian Salsa (a.k.a. your standard chunky and fresh pico de gallo, (tomatoes, onions, cilantro, and lime juice)). I have never in my life had something that was breaded and deep-fried so soggy in my life!!!  The breading was heavy and disgusting.  It also came with the worst plantains I've ever had.  Dry, overcooked, and extremely chewy.  Put it this way, I've had better plantains at Bahama Breeze then this place (yes I said Bahama Breeze).I am not trying to pick on this place.  I swear!!!  But when the owner's brother helps you order and tells you what they are known for and what they make best and they miss horribly?  Well, needless to say I can only imagine what there non-staple dishes taste like.Not to beat up on these nice folks too much.  They place was cute.  The place was painted in a vibrant yellowish/brownish mustard type color, which gave the place a warm and bright feel.  On one wall was a mural of what was to resemble a village in Peru.  The other wall was a collection of trinkets from the native land and of course the flag of Peru.  The servers were extremely nice.  Beware, when you order water, they bring out bottled (and charge you), so if you want tap you need to ask and depending on your Spanish or their lack of English, that may be a challenge. I hate to say this because the place was quaint and the help was friendly, but if you have a craving for Central American and/or Peruvian food, don't waste your money or time here. I'm just going to wait till the next time I'm back east in NY or DC/Northern VA to get real and tasty Peruvian food and I would suggest you do the same.~~#~0
Yuck. The chicken tasted more like the grill than the meat itself.  The "salad" was shredded lettuce with dressing, no veggies.  The location is great, so I'm a little disappointed the food wasn't better.~~#~0
I brought my vintage Stratocaster in to get set up and have a new nut installed. $40 for a set up and $40 for the nut. I thought $40 for the nut was a bit steep, but Dave said he hand shaped and slotted the nuts himself. So, I went for it. Dropped her off on a Thursday and was told I could pick it up the following Wednesday. He had to order a white or bone nut because all he stocks are black graphite nuts. I show up on Wednesday and he acts surprised to see me. Said he had to check the mail to see if the nut had even arrived. He then locked me out of the store to walk to the mailbox. Fine, I'll stand in the heat while you have my guitar hostage. Did I mention that I had to pay the $80 + tax up front? Yep. Dave returns from the mailbox with a handful of junk and no nut. No apology, just "oops, I forgot Monday was a holiday, and I was sick yesterday" (right). He said I could pick it up tomorrow (Thursday). So, I call at around 3:30PM, and he told me they shipped the nut to his old store. OK. They were overnighting the new nut. He finally called me Friday afternoon to tell me the guitar was ready. I took a long dinner break from work and swung by to finally get my guitar. I checked it out in the shop and the set up was nice and the action was good. I had to rush back to work so I didn't get to really inspect everything. When I finally got home, I noticed the nut had about 1mm of overhang on both sides. I though, "that doesn't look hand shaped". I took the strings off to have a closer look. I popped the nut out and it was exactly what I thought. It was a pre slotted Tusq nut that costs $6.95, sloppily glued in to place. Dave sucks.~~#~0
In response to my earlier review.  I received a phone call from the owner or the manager (I am choosing to leave the name off).  He explained the reason for the delay in responding but became very agitated and wanted me to put him through to my boss.  I refused so he threatened Yelp review retaliation.  My immediate reaction was to laugh.  He then became verbally immature and ended the call with a (not going to say the actual words) "eff you, c**t" and hung up on me. Again, food might be great, but no one, under any circumstances, deserves that kind of an assault from a business representative. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------I was planning a large party (25) for a business event, so I wrote to the contact address asking for answers to my specific questions.  It took 3 days for a response and the response was, "thanks for your interest.  Please call for answers."  I have never been to the restaurant and was inquiring based upon the reviews here on Yelp.  The food might be great.  The atmosphere might be wonderful, but based on the response I got in an email, the customer service is below sub-par.  I will never walk in and spend my money, nor will I set up an event where we might drop $1000+ like we have at other venues in the area.If the manager or the owner is watching here...it would have been worth the 5 minutes to reply as requested.~~#~0
I have tried on several occassions to find something good to say about this store and all I can say is "They carry Wise potato chips".  Only place I have found in Phoenix where I can buy these.Now on the other hand, the management and cashiers are very rude to the customers.  They also are not knowledgeable about what they sell.  I had a question and they had to get one of their customers to help me.Last time I was in there was for a sale which I had received an email saying about 20% off sale starting that afternoon.  I called the store to verify this and was told it pertained to ALL merchandise.  When I checked out they did not give me this discount.  I complained and cashier had to call store manager who had to call the employee I had talked to earlier. It turned out to be a mess but they finally decided (begrudgingly) to give me my 20% off.  After I left the store I discovered they had lied and not deducted the discount and charged me the fulll amount.  I thought they would give me the discount on my credit card bill but just got my bill and there was no credit.  I called the HO and talked to customer service who then contined to argue with me about the discount.  She told me she would have her manager call me back but of course he has not.This whole corporation is filled with liars and rude people.I saw one woman who came into this store late one night in Dec when it was pouring rain.  She had pulled up close to the front entry and the security guard asked her to move her vehicle.  This woman was handicapped and all spaces were filled.   She asked if they could loan her an unbrella if she had to walk from the back of lot in the rain.  They refused even though they had many of them sitting in the front of the store.  She walked out and drove away.  Good for her!!!!My friend who worked at the HO was off for 16 weeks with an injury (Non work related) and the day she was released by her doctor to return to work was FIRED.This is not the type of business I wish to deal with any longer and ask all intelligent persons to do the same.As for my chips, I will get someone on the East Coast to send them to me.~~#~0
My mom and I went to Si Senor tonight on a whim.  We coudn't find the place we were looking for and she wanted Mexican.  Someone had mentioned this place a while back.  Well I'm gonna have to tell this person off!  JK... I can't hold her accountable, she just has horrible taste in Mexican food.We both ordered  the #1, tamale, relleno, enchilada, taco.  Its all served on one big plate, covered in either red or green sauce.  Oh and a pile of "chile con carne".  If you need to cover the entire plate with tons of sauce something is probably wrong.  You get a large pool of beans covered in... you guessed it - CHEESE! and some mediocre rice.  I wouldn't have minded all this cheese or sauce if what was under it all tasted good.  The relleno was fried to death, greasy and flavorless.  The tamale was ok, but I only had 2 bites.  I think that may have been from your grocers freezer.  The "beef taco" was ground beef!  WTF?  Okay, we make these at home because we grew up on a budget and we had to do what we had to do.  But we never called them beef tacos.  WHY? Because beef tacos are SHREDDED BEEF that has been slow roasted or braised with chile and spices.  Ground beef tacos are "hamburger tacos".  Ejole!  BUT, again, I wouldn't have minded if it at least had some flavor!  You're killin me smalls!  The beans?  Just fucking sad... brown ooze topped with melted cheese. Clearly from a can. Didn't taste the enchilada cuz I couldn't stomach any more damn sauce and the chile con carne looked like, well...canned.I do have a couple good things to say:  The chips and salsa were good. I enjoyed the red salsa and the sour cream dip.  Good thing I always get carried away with the chips and salsa or I would've gone home hungry.  The sopapilla at the end of the meal was good.  Fried dough covered in sugar and cinnamon - you can't go wrong.  I have to say, the waitress was really friendly and accommodating.  My point here is, its okay if you're not the most authentic (and I know everyone's opinion might differ on the way any one dish "should" be prepared) as long as you're putting out fresh flavorful food, you're doing okay.  I hate to write such a bad review, but I have to be honest.  I should have gone to the taco shop down the street on Ray and Warner (Taqueria Mi Casita).  They have real (Mexican) food and I would've saved about half the bill!~~#~0
Friend said, hey they have the best wings in town.  Mmmm.  I go wherever the wing compass points me and I will eat no wing before its time!Cheesy atmosphere, Hooters girl very immature, she was spending most of her time with what was obviously her friends eating there.  The girls looked skanky, like Highlighter rejects.  Or young white trash trailer mom's in training.  But I don't care much for the so called hotties, I was there to get my wing on.  Then the wings came out, devoid of any sauce, and I ordered medium.  (And the wings are not cut, you get the whole damn wing, I hate that.  I like wings and drummettes not the whole thing).The waitress was no where to be seen for some time, so I called over the manager he got me my sauce and that quieted me for a bit.  Place looked dirty, could smell cigarette smoke from behind the glass doors that gives way to a patio for some very wasted frat looking tards.Horrible wings, stupid sexist concept, overall cruddy experience.~~#~0
Waitress took a long time to seat us. Then didn't give us an option on table choice (we didn't want to sit in the doorway), when I asked her to move she told me "you can sit over there" in such a rude tone. We decided to leave.~~#~0
Seriously.....F*** this place!  Disgusting food and shitty service, ambience is great if you like to dine in a hot cellar engulfed in stagnated air.  Truly it is over rated, over priced, and they just under deliver.  Forget trying to order a drink here, it will take forever to get and when it finally does arrive you will be ready to pass out from heat exhaustion and lack of oxygen.  How's that for a head change, you don't even have to pay for it!I won't disgust you with the detailed review of everything I have tried here, but to make it simple, it all sucks!  And after you get the bill you will be walking out with a sore ass!  Save your money and spare your self the disappointment.~~#~0
I have been going here for years now. I have always felt the customer service was terrible. The appearance of the staff is worse and the place really "feels" like a dollar store. Never the less, the prices have been reasonable and I like the idea of suppporting the local business... well not any more! I thought I had turned a movie back in, but when I rented another, they asked me about it. Low and behold, I had left it at my girlfrineds house. Ok so I go to turn it in. 13 days late now. I expected a fee, but it was $19.50 (with a big grin on the clerks face - mind you this is the first time I have ever seen an employee smile there.) I asked what the cost would be to buy it - $29.00. Keep in mind I recieved no courtesy call to ask about the movie when it was obviously very late. True it is my fault, but the fee seems excessive in this economy where redbox sells them for $15 if you don't turn them in and video stores are dying by the score. What really did me in was the fact that the one guy was practically laughing and the manger or owner did not thank me, apologize, or show any sign of empathy whatsoever. Superstar scores an "F"~~#~0
Chicken and Waffles DO NOT BELONG TOGETHER. Ew.I understand that the world probably thinks I am the scum of the earth for giving Lo-Lo's such a low rating, however, I cannot bring myself to like greasy, nasty food.Why is the Kool-aid flavored red? Why is it not called "Cherry"? These are the questions that haunt my dreams. Not only do I hate the food here, but why is it in the middle of no where? I had so much trouble finding it.You may be wondering why I even bothered to come here in the first place... good question. It is safe to assume that I will NEVER step foot in this door again.~~#~0
Bleh. This place looks pretty rough, but it's been here for a long time and I was thinking that the food must be pretty good if it's survived that long. Wrong.  I'd say that at least half of my Hunan chicken & shrimp combo went in the trash. I could've done better with Panda Express and I'll be eating a bowl of Cap'n Crunch in hour or two.Fortune cookie: Desire, like the atom, is explosive with creative force. In bed.~~#~0
Why in God's name would a shoe repair shop be closed Saturday?I should have known at that point that things were screwed up. My second clue was the plastic fake Louis Vuitton bags for sale, hanging on the wall. My third was when the employee argued with me about what I wanted -- namely, for my heels to be resoled with something that gives them a little more grip, because 4" heels + highly polished floor at work have earned me the nickname of "Cripple". I specifically asked that the heel itself get a little something for grip, since that area seemed to be the worst culprit. The man argued with me, saying the heel shouldn't matter. Well, unless you have a secret, big guy, I doubt you have a lot of experience with the treacherous specifics of heels. The fourth clue was when he ran my debit card and the machine ran out of paper and he didn't know if the transaction went through or not.What?When I picked the shoes up, I then had to wait while he flipped through the entire day's transactions from the day I had dropped the shoes off to make sure the payment went through. Why is this my problem? Why do I have to stand there for five minutes while you do that?  And then, next time I wore the heels to work, the heels themselves slipped all over on the floor, just like I thought they would. Sure, the ball of my foot was fine, but that wasn't the problem in the first place. So I spent $15 for nothing. Thanks.~~#~0
This place is awful! The chicken tikka masala is not flavored and it tastes like the sauce is Campbell's tomato soup. The tikka masala fries were soggy and luke warm at best. The service was lacking, and the place wasn't even busy! I would drive the .2 miles to The Dhaba and never look back! Best of Phoenix 2011, yeah right!~~#~0
My brother and I came here on the last day of school before Christmas break, to celebrate our achievements. We were so excited to eat! We were waiting in line and there was a line of people with clipboards just staring at us, hard and smiling. It was as if.....as if they were...ROBOTS! They couldn't take their eyes off us, and just kept smiling. So we left and hadn't been back since.No but I'm being serious, that really happened.~~#~0
Place sucks. Right when we went it, we showed out Restaurant.com gift certificate, and they rejected us because it was a weekend. No where on the gift certificate does it say anything about using it on the weekday. So there service isn't great, it was dead in there... no customers and they still didn't take our gift certificate... bad business to turn customers away especially when there's no one in there. Haven't even got to try the food... darn.~~#~0
Everything that we ordered, including rice and beans tasted like fish.  Even the red chili burrito that was covered is sauce tasted like fish.  They obviously don't clean surfaces or utensils after handling fish, let alone who knows what else.  Disgusting.  Would never go back.~~#~0
Worst business ever award. They never answer the phone. Their.customer service is terrible. The store is disorganized and looks like black Friday is everyday. Go somewhere else if you can.~~#~0
bland.  dry.  underwhelming burger.  sure they have many options but so does fuddruckers and fuddruckers is crap as well.  chicago hamburger co is where it's at.  spent 20 for girlfriend and i ate original hamburger works and won't be doing that again anytime soon.  and that burger was not 1/2 pound.  the only good thing was that they had red cream soda.  by far the most disappointing place i;ve been that i heard about via this website.thanks for misleading yelpers.  this place doesnt believe in seasoning.btw.  chili fries tastes like carl's jr's.  100% crap.~~#~0
Encountered the rudest and most unprofessional employee here at this venue EVER...what tha f*** ???Not even the nice ones could make up for it.  We had great seats, right behind Home team Dugout.  Even the fellow fans in the seats around us were great....but this one employee was so completely off the chart lame, I'm going to fault this whole establishment for her suckiness.~~#~0
Good food, but horrible, stuffy and pretentious atmosphere.  Showed up for late lunch & was greeted by a completely self-absorbed young girl who has clearly never received training in customer service.  The place was nearly empty and she asked (with a bored blank stare) if we had a reservation.  When we said no, she huffed and acted very put off.  Once we were seated, the service was so terrible that we left before eating our meal.  Have dined here multiple times.  Just cannot take the poor service and generally stuffy, "wealthy grandmother" like atmosphere any longer.~~#~0
I've always heard that a three star review is the worst rating because it doesn't invoke love of a place and it doesn't bring out emotions of hate, it's just bleh. I had a nightmare of a time getting my hair done yesterday, but I went back today to talk to the owner and received a full refund. I have never done something like this before, but when I post my tale of misery you will soon understand why....I have been growing my hair out for over a year so that I could do the generous thing and donate it to Locks of Love or an equivalent. This means I couldn't style it, cut it, or color it the way I wanted to.And anyone who knows me knows that this was a HUGE sacrifice.I contemplated many salons and this one was:1. Close to my house2. Affordable3. Clean4. Presented amazing hair cuts to choose from (because you presume that if they have haircuts on the walls and in a book that the stylist should know how to do them!)I printed a picture of a very sexy chin length cut that would have looked amazing on me and left enough hair for the donation. I wanted to go all out and sass up the color too.I called the salon and talked to a woman, who I later found out, was the owner. I explained what I wanted and she quoted me a price from $45- $70 for the color and possibly the cut. I expected it to be more in the $60 range anyway and made and appointment.When I went in I was greeted and taken back to a station shortly thereafter by a "relaxed" woman. The woman seemed chill, but I found out that soon after she was just "too chill" for my liking.I wanted her to put my hair into pigtails for the donation; she proceeded to tell me the L.O.L. wouldn't accept them in two ponytails. I told her they would. She comes back and puts my hair into pigtails without parting it to make sure that my hair would be even and then doesn't even measure it. I was about to mention how she didn't part the hair but was distracted that she didn't even want to measure my donation insisting that they take it no matter what the length because "they are so desperate for hair." No, she needs to measure it. And I make her. She measures the donation with a comb that I presumed had a ruler on it, but after all of this, I bet it didn't.She cuts the first side off chin length, Perfect. She cuts the other side off.... At my cheek bone.... WTF WTF WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!OHMG. WTF am I supposed to do now. I tell her that is WAAAAYY too short for the cut I wanted. She insisted that it will look like that when she is done. I felt that I may have been over reacting since it is the first time I am going this short.Then she grabs her straight edge razor and says to me with hair in hand, "Time to carve!"Time to carve what?!?!!?  I'm not a fucking turkey! And there goes the hair on the back of my head. It is too late all is lost. What the fuck. It's 3 p.m. and I'm supposed to meet a friend at 5 p.m. Can this be salvaged? I can't go anywhere else today and get this shit fixed.The owner then walks over noticing concern on my face. She then consults with my stylist (or torturer) about the color I wanted and told her the best way to do it. (I should have never EVER let this woman put color on my hair if she didn't know what to do in the first place.)But hindsight is always 20/20.She insists that it will look better with the color in it and brings me a book of color samples. I tell her that I wanted a specific red on my hair from the book. The woman looks at the number and tells me "we don't keep that red in stock, you would have to order that color 6 weeks in advance." Really? Six weeks in advance? Do they grow the flowers and smash up the leaves themselves? There's a beauty supply down the street, I could go there and buy it myself. Then the owner walks over. She's trying to talk me out of putting any red into my hair at all because, "when you shower or even sweat the color will bleed... " It will bleed? I have had red hair color in my hair before AND I see plenty of people dye their hair red. I know red fades, but bleeding when I sweat? I don't think so. Not unless you will be using red koolaide to dye my hair.Either way, I'm not getting red. So I tell them I want blonde on the top where the layers are and some black underneath. The owner is telling the woman how to section my hair so it looks right and I feel better because I'm thinking, "The owner knows what she's doing when it comes to where to color the hair. All this woman has to do is slap the dye on and style it."She brings the dye back and does the "black" color underneath and foils it out of the way. Then she starts slathering the bleach on my hair and does not foil it, just bundles the hair up and throws a plastic cap on. I didn't notice it at the time, but she never set a timer and walked outside to have a cigarette. She comes back to check my hair and says, oh it's lifting! To be continued~~#~0
Inattentive service.Food was so squalid that I literally wrote a narrative on the back of the receipt to give to chef about food preparation.Drinks are OK but terribly overpriced.Certainly a place to go on a friday night if you're looking to party, but I would HEAVILY suggest against eating here, especially if you like Mexican food.  Terrible food.  Would be considered bland even if you were a Iowan from some small two-horse town and had never had Mexican food before.Terrible service.  Waited 15 minutes on a slow night for service and had t o walk inside and ask the bartender to sent a waitress out.  And even then, completely indifferent.Overall impression.   Someone needs a tax writeoff.  It's almost as if "The Producer's" Max Bialystock opened a Mexican restaurant:  "So we can make MORE money if the restaurant fails?  BRILLIANT!"~~#~0
I had a really disappointing experience with The Breadfruit. It was a Monday. It was a nice day. We wanted a picnic. We stopped at the Breadfruit to ask if we could get something to go. We were told no.The woman (owner?) told us repeatedly that they are a dine-IN restaurant, that it meant we can not take our food with us, and that take-out is bad for the environment. She was superior and insulting.My friend and I both work in restaurants. We are perfectly clear what dine in means. We would have tipped the server. We were flexible. We were hungry. We would have been happy to take our food in tin foil. We would have been happy to bring our own plates to receive the food on. We could have sat down, taken a bite, and asked for doggie bags. We understood that the Breadfruit is a dine-in restaurant, but they could have worked with us. There was only one occupied table in the place, but she flat out refused to serve us and was rude about it. Unbelievable!I won't be back for dine-in. I won't be back ever.~~#~0
I tried to be optimistic but just couldn't love really anything about the place. Maybe the pretty color scheme? Coffee was just okay. There was nothing special that I couldn't get elsewhere. We went there for brunch and since the breakfast menu offered such an average selection, we ordered a sandwich instead. I don't recommend the Po Boy sandwich, which took over 20 minutes to make and tasted like s***. Sorry, but this is the reason why Phoenix is always missing something that urban cities have . . . character, taste, and uniqueness. Don't get me wrong, we need more healthy food markets that are independently owned but Luci's standard for food and selection of what they sell is an extreme disappointment and even an embarrassment.~~#~0
Scale of 1-10 (single visit):7 Food6 *Drinks*3 Service7 Atmosphere7 ValueThe other Doses I've been to have been fine (though still nothing special) and I assume this was just an off night for these guys, but I have to rate them according to my direct experience.  Maybe I'll get to give them another try so I can change it, but we'll see.~~#~0
Went for minor throat symptoms. Was prescribed prednisone (a steroid). When I got home and checked the bottle, it was labeled cephalexin (an antibiotic) and had someone else's name! Turns out everyone got the right pills, but my bottle had the wrong label. So not as bad as it might have been, but still an unacceptable mistake. Doubt I will use them again.~~#~0
Wow what a huge disappointment coming here was. The staff was good a we were seated quickly for a Friday night.  We have heard so much good we passed on Grimaldi's to come here.- Ordered the Antipasto for $11, it was ok but not enough for 2 people. Pricey for little.- Ordered Regina Margherita D.O.C this was just awful. This thing looked like it fell on the floor. 3 faint cheese spots with 3 basil leave mostly on 1 side and a cherry tomato not a San Marzano like advertised. The sauce was bland and tasted like tomato soup concentrate. $14 very pricey This with 2 glasses of wine costs me $60..Ouch.For anyone who cooks or likes to eat you have to have passion and present your food as the best value, this was a meager attempt at that. Maybe this La Piazza has seen it's better days. I will never know as I won't return.~~#~0
I really hate giving one star to a restaurant unless I have just a really horrible experience, but the food here is too bad to give it any more than that.  This place is a hole in the wall at Greenfield and Main at the end of a strip mall.  I was hoping it was one of those type of places where the restaurant looks terrible but the food is amazing- I was wrong.  I went in there at lunch time and the place was packed with seniors.  I figured with a bunch of old folks there, it was bound to be good and cheap, but evidently it caters more to the set that doesn't have many taste buds left.  It's hard to imagine a meal costing just over $5 not being worth your money these days, but I really felt this was not worth the little that I spent.  Granted, I did get the lunch buffet- which had a very limited selection.  I know often times the food off the menu is better, but I can't honestly see how it could be too much better at this place.  The pepper beef was virtually tasteless, and the beef had more of a consistency of tofu than a cow product.  another entree, honey chicken, tasted very little like honey, and the chicken pieces tasted overly fried.  The spare ribs were very small, and was predominantly sauce, which was almost sickeningly sweet.  The fried rice was ok, I suppose it's hard to screw that up.  The white rice was very sticky.  With hot tea and tax, my meal came to a total of $6.06.  I don't think I  have ever eaten so little at a buffet.  They do offer a menu, but I don't think I will be back to try it.  There are way too many Chinese restaurants out there to waste another meal at this place.~~#~0
This was the first and last time I will visit this sunny establishment. Please let me start by saying don't be fooled by the name thinking you may get some spice in your meal when visiting this establishment. I would like to enlighten any potential consumers on the epic failure of the evening I just experienced. Failure number one, they had our reservation incorrect and multiple times mentioning that we had made the reservation incorrectly. Failure number two, your menu on-line does not match your actual menu. When you say you have Hatch green chili on the menu make sure you can actually serve it. Multiple times I asked about the spice and was told it was very spicy, and was disappointed at the lack there of. I am a lover of New Mexico green chili, so if you compare your food to it you shouldn't be light years off on the descriptions.Third failure of the night was dumping a full ice cold drink down the side of my leg and back of my pants. Not only was I upset at the fact you soaked my jeans, but then offended at the idea the server was going to get a blow dryer and dry off my pants. If I wanted to wear my jeans straight out of the washing machine, I would have done so but thank you to the service staff, they took liberty of doing that for me. So, you want me to take off my pants to blow dry them you say, failure number four. Epic failure number five was the sub-par meals that followed along with the "flaming" drink that is not worth ordering The food was by far the worst thing of the night, which compared to everything else would seem like nothing. If you think you are going to get food, turn around and go back home and eat a bean burrito.  After all that we attempted to salvage the evening with some humor, but then comes failure number six. When the bill arrives we were told that although the server dumped a drink all over me, nothing could be done to adjust the bill. It was just a little liquid as I was reminded by the server AND the manager. I wasn't looking to make a scene but when I stood up from the table, someone asked me if I had an "accident" (I'm 29 and housebroken). Even to this point, I was just annoyed. This brings us to failure number 7, when paying for the bill we presented our overly intelligent server a $50 visa card and asked her to run the card for that amount, and came back letting us know it was declined. In surprise, I look up the account information on my phone to only see of the $50 loaded on the card the previous day a $48 charge was in the transaction history for Fire and Spice. When we asked the server, she responded by asking if we had ever stayed in a hotel before and how there is an "incidental" charge which is why the card didn't go through. I asked for the manager at this point, who felt it was okay to tell me again that the bill was now being discounted because of the small spill on me. So after showing him the charge on-line he then got his second level manager. Oh boy, if you are in the mood for being told you are an idiot, this is the guy to talk to! Failure number 8. When you walk into a customer service situation as the second level manager in an issue, normally one would look to diffuse the situation and not escalate it. Not this guy, he enjoys full confrontation with customers. Not to mention he also witnessed the events of the night unfold and rather than offering to make the situation better, he chose the much higher route of saying that clearly our card was declined because there wasn't enough money on it even after seeing the transaction history of the card, with their establishment as the only charge. Nothing he said made sense and walked away as if we bothered him by asking for an explanation of the charge. So here's to you manager's of Fire and Spice at the Sheraton Hotel in Tempe, AZ.. keeping it classy and bringing in customers to make them feel warm a fuzzy inside. Beware hospitality is at it's finest in this establishment!  WINNING!!!!~~#~0
The jazz pianist is fantastic.Otherwise the food sucks & the place just creeps me out.BOTTOM LINE: Great piano music does not make a great restaurant~~#~0
I'm not really fond of writing sub par reviews. I really covet being wowed, I like being pleasantly surprised, and I can have a perfectly merry day with a run of the mill meal. Unfortunately, there are some experiences that don't fit in to any of my "I will return again and again or at least recommend to friends" template.  Majerle's is one of those experiences.I know that I should definitely give this place another try but only because I had such a bad time I think that it must have been entirely abnormal because it would be out of business if it was run this way daily. When I arrived on Sunday afternoon (right as the Cardinals game was about to start), there were several content tables already enjoying their beer and bar fare. I must say that the food wasn't terrible. I wouldn't classify it as anything special or something that I would crave on any particular day. But the wings were crisp, the salad was fresh'ish' and the burger was prepared to the temp I ordered. This is where the one star came from. Decent food (good temp, tastes like what it's supposed to, sans hair, ect) deserves some credit.    If I could give negative stars for service, this would be a -5 Stars type of place. Our server was either hung over or was just entirely uninterested in doing ANYTHING that her job description calls for. She greeted us about ten minutes after we sat down (although it was a Cardinals game day, the bar was probably about half full). She took our drink order and returned with our drinks ages later (well, another almost ten minutes). I was starving and ready to order food but wasn't able to because she slammed the drinks on the table and left again. I flagged down another server and he was so kind as to send ours back. FINALLY I ordered. Again, the food was fine. It wasn't, however, fine enough to cancel out the fact that our appetizer was delivered 20 minutes laster followed IMMEDIATELY by our entree's. Ok. Fine. But, the salad was wrong the first time (Note: When your guests are ordering, it helps to listen to what they actually want. It is NOT a good practice to forget and then just 'guess' what they said). And our server didn't even deliver our food so we couldn't order another drink until we flagged her down again. We ordered another two beers and waited. And waited. And waited. I saw our beers sitting on the bar and our server chatting in the corner to another associate. We couldn't get her attention so my dining companion/boyfriend went to the bar himself to get them. In fact, we didn't see our server again for the rest of the meal. I was so irate at this point that I wanted to leave immediately and spend our Sunday afternoon football watching/beer drinking pennies elsewhere. I flagged down the same server I asked to find my server the first time and had him do my bidding again (he seemed to be working, why couldn't I have sat in HIS section?) She came over, mumbled some apology about having to get our own beers and dropped our check.   Bright points: They have a great tv set up for football watching. Multiple tv's tuned to every single game you could imagine. Not so Bright Points: For me, watching football at a sports bar has necessary accoutrements (steady flow of beer, timely delivery of food, ect) to make it enjoyable. This mark was completely missed due entirely to the complete disregard our server had for her job. Or her guests.Downright Dim points: Well, this review pretty much sums it up. If I'm in the area and kind of desperate, perhaps I'll try it again. Probably Not.~~#~0
Terrible customer service. Was told I would be called back for a special order item. One week later, no calls. Guess they don't need my $$. Went to sportsman's warehouse and they took care of me.~~#~0
Make Sure You Are Not A Work In! I scheduled an appointment last Friday with Emily. I was not told I was a "WORK IN" but apparently I was. I waited an hour for my appointment and then was rushed all the way through. I felt bad for Emily as her next client was waiting so I did not have her blow out/ style my hair. This was a mistake. I went home and found that my sides had been cut way too short and too far back. I went back today for a correction and was completely blindsighted by how I was treated. I found Emily to be abrasive and confrontational. She tried to claim she never cut my sides?  Then I was quickly told I was a "Work in" as if that made it all OK?  When I explained I did not know I was a "Work in" and wouldnt have come if I had, Emily rudely stated " I can't control what the front desk does!"Everyone in the salon including the owner Sheri heard and did nothing. In fact Sheri took us to to her office " to talk"  where Emily continued to speak to me in a very demeaning manner and Sheri continued to do nothing. At one point I asked Sheri if she felt Emily was behaving in a professional manner and she stated "She's just frustrated." Shes frustrated? I am the one sporting a quasi mullet and I am behaving the most rationally out of the bunch. Another stylist was to fix my hair but she was just as rude. It was pretty clear by her attitude that she wanted no part of the situation and told me the only fix was to cut the length and blend. Not what I wanted to hear as I am trying to grow it out.  In the end I left with no correction.  The bottom line is Emily was rushed and it shows all over my hair.  And not only did my hair get jacked but I was treated terribly in the process. It was clear to me that Sheri has no control over her stylists and will allow them to disrespect her paying clents. Currently a pic of me and my baby are on the Salon Esprit website. I am so appauled by how I was treated that I have asked for it to come down immediately.~~#~0
Atmosphere, alcohol, and service.  If that's all your looking for, then you've found a nice spot.  However, if you intend on eating I'd suggest you continue driving down the street to one of the many Scottsdale restaurants that will deliver a much better meal.  We were part of a large party with a pre-ordered dinner, so perhaps this played into the quality....really hard to say.  Our grilled romaine salad tasted very reminiscent of those days when my father would douse the bbq with lighter fluid and then attempt to tell us later the flavor that was strangely burning our tongues was "outdoor grilling at it's best".  Sorry, but it didn't work for Dad and it didn't work last night either.  I thought that perhaps the salad was a fluke, but unfortunately the disappointment continued through the bland spaghetti-o like pasta and the easy bake oven version of dessert.  If any of the food had displayed the slightest bit of potential, I would have been happy to give them another shot.  But life is short and there's too many other restaurants putting forth a much better effort.~~#~0
Why did I go here again when I've had bad luck in the past?  Went about 2 years ago, food was just OK, service sucked.  2 years later, exact same....Visited for lunch on a week-day.  Place was very empty.  Service was very slow.  Took an hour for lunch between seating and leaving.  Food was just OK, drinks were empty and the waitress just didn't really seem to care (and she was only handling 2 tables).  $16 for a sandwich and ice tea.~~#~0
This is the original Macayo's and man has it seen better days. The decor is old. The carpeting is tired. The plates are chipped and scratched up. The service is crap and the food is NOT what it is at other Macayo's around town. It took our server 10 minutes to come and get our drink order. One member of our party ordered a Coke and it was totally flat. It took her another 10 minutes to replace it.  I had a chicken taco and the chicken tasted canned. The server spilled salsa all over the table and took forever to come back to clean it up. One member of our party ordered a bean and cheese burrito enchilada style and got a beef and green chili burrito with verde sauce...and then our server seemed befuddled when we asked for her to replace it with what we actually ordered.Honestly, I have eaten in better dive-Mexican places than this Macayos. Definitely skip this spot.~~#~0
I agree with Susan , I saw a Huffy bike for $200 yesterday , a dress for $100 and yes, the prices are way over priced and the 2 employees never greet you , the girl is always on her phone. I would fire all employees and hire honest friendly ones. There is never any good items , I believe one or some of the employees is working with an outside source to sell the valuable items like fine jewelry and antiques , there is never these items . This place should be shut down for good.  I hope God doesn't punish them for ripping people off and being money hungry.~~#~0
My Consumers experience and observations: I first went to the Celebrity in 1973 to see Gordon Lightfoot. Over the years I have seen many other concerts there and enjoyed myself.. I have got to say, this venue  has changed considerably and it needs major refurbishing. Also, I have some safety and security concerns. We went to a concert there this past week for Pepe Aguilar ---- and have not been there in about five years. The sound system is inadequate for the acts they are presenting and the seating is very poor.Safety and security issues -  my opinion. At about twenty minutes into his performance - we still had the same group of intoxicated young women standing directly in front of us and would not sit down. Most everyone else had set down in the area.  At first I asked nicely and they started to give us a hard time.  I did raise my voice once because it was so loud. There was no presence of any staff in the area we were in. I walked down and no one was in the entrance area. I went back to my seat ---- and the women started yelling - "See We Set Down"  then the situation escalated a bit with them dropping a few F bombs directed at the both of us ---- and I went down stairs again - and had to get all the way to the bar area before I found a staff member - I told him there is no one from staff in our area or proximity -- he said he would get a manager ----- Went through three different people before a manager showed up - and he took me outside - I had told him what was going on ---- and he said I needed to read the back of the ticket ---- and at a venue people can stand and there is nothing they can do about it  ---- he then said my behavior was scarring him ---- and wanted a police officer to talk to me ----- I told him I was not going to leave my wife alone ----- He would not let me back in until I spoke to an officer. - He did have someone go to the area to make sure nothing happened to her. The officer who showed up did explain they had no control over people standing up. He was very polite.  I asked to have someone from staff go back with me to my seat ---- so the small group would know ---- I was complaining about them --- The staff member  told me there would be someone in the area (they were there for about ten minutes) and one of the staff members apologized to me and apologized about the lack of numbers on the seats ---- that is another issue --- apparently they are painting and the seats or aisles are not numbered - at least in our area. When we first came into the venue ----- I asked someone for assistance and they took me to the seats - then some other patrons tried to kick us out ----- demanding the seats until they finally figured it out they were wrong. Another issue about safety ---- there is no aisle lighting - making it very difficult to get out of the area.Regarding the standing up issue ----- another review here mentions that - the theater  would not let people stand ---- and kicked them out. I guess it depends on the show. I am concerned that there is not enough staff to safely manage a variety of issues including enough people to escort individuals to the correct seats.. Also, I believe the manager - went overboard talking about my behavior - I made no threatening comments or gestures ----- If there was a problem with my behavior - clearly I demonstrated I was trying to resolve a situation by seeking assistance which was difficult to find. That was part of my frustration.. This establishment needs a remodel the facility and make sure there is staff available for guest  assistance.  And --- according to management - there apparently they have no control intoxicated individuals that won't sit down and let others enjoy the show.  Fortunately the young women finally  left us alone ----- but we left early so there was no chance of them harassing us.My recommendation to management for a more rewarding customer experience:1. Have more staff on duty to deal with customer service issues - or manage staff better to have all areas covered. At minimum the venue should have one person covering each seating section at all times to deal with a wide variety of issues. This could eliminate many problems.2. Be more sensitive to customer complaints. Management could have offered relocating customers if there is a problem (if seating is available). We had to sit through the concert worried we would be harassed.3. Install basic aisle lighting for increased safety of the guest.4. The current seating needs to be replaced with more comfortable seats and or more room between the seats in front of a patron ----- If I had not had an aisle seat - I would have had to crunch my legs up against the seat in front of me -- and we know how that would have gone with that group in front of us :).~~#~0
I don't trust these folks at all.  I was contacted by Quicken when I signed up for Lending Tree (a big mistake, don't use Lending Tree).  When the agent called I told him I was looking for a 10 year re-finance, at a fixed rate.  I specifically told him I needed to know what the best rate and the costs would be.  It took several calls from the agent before he finally told me their rate and cost.  The rate was .1% higher than a competing lender and their costs were twice as much.  I told him I would go with the other, less expensive lender and then he got real aggressive, telling me that Quicken was the best lender in the business (yeah right).  Once I finally got him to understand that cost was the deciding factor he then recommended I let him review the loan docs. from the other lender.  I didn't even know this guy, why would anyone let a stranger look over your loan docs?After finally getting off the call, I started receiving repeated calls from another Quicken agent.  I finally took one of the calls to tell her to stop contacting me.  Since then the emails have been coming fast and furious, even when I replied asking them not to contact me at all.  One of the emails my request came from the original lending agent, saying something to the effect of, "call me and let's set up an appt. to discuss your loan."If you want to avoid being pestered indefinately, NEVER contact Quicken Loans.~~#~0
Gave Ra two chances.  Still do not like the atmosphere, nor the food.  What's with the loud music?  Perhaps it's management hoping that I won't notice how awful the food is by painfully triggering my eardrums.  The noodle soup, the title of which goes something like... $14 bowl of soup (I don't know, it was so noisy, I couldn't think!) was TERRIBLE.  I really can't expound on why I found it disgusting.  All I remember as I tasted the broth and noodles was a flashback of Warner Bros. cartoons where a character (was it Bugs Bunny?) was shoveling paper money into a burning fireplace.  Total waste of money.  Mom didn't like the soup, as well.  A coworker of mine and I met here for happy hour and tried many apps, which I do admit were nicely priced.  The low prices aren't enough to get me to return, however.  The one plate I remember liking, so much so that I ordered it twice (we were very hungry) was made of tofu.  I even wrote it down and asked for it at my favorite sushi resto, but they didn't know what it could be, much less replicate it.  Since I'm not much of a drinker, I cannot discuss happy hour drink specials as I only drink water- I rarely order alcohol because I prefer to eat my calories.Sayona-Ra!~~#~0
I feel so strongly in giving a 1-star review, that I'm taking the time out to write this at midnight after just flying back from Arizona.  Sure, the place may be pretty fancy, but if customer service sucks, then I find that more important than having a nice looking bathroom.The front desk was super snooty.  The following quotes are what I think they were wanting to say out loud, but couldn't:(1)  "Oh no, brown people are staying at our hotel" (2)   "Ugh, babies do not belong at our high class hotel"OR, the 2 guys who we dealt with simply had bad attitudes.  I don't remember their names; therefore I will provide descriptions of them.Every time I asked a question or made some request, the front desk guy with short brown hair made it seem like I was an inconvenience.  There was no warmth or kindness in his manners or tone of voice when I interacted with him..  In another instance, we had the displeasure of speaking with another front desk guy, who had black gelled hair.  We were asking about late check-outs, and he gave us the standard rates of checking out late:  check-out after 1pm and we would get charged $50, check-out b/w 3 and 6 pm and we would get charged half our room.  We asked if there was any flexibility in the times since we were travelling with our baby, but the guy was just rude in how he presented the rates.  The next morning, we called the front desk to confirm our late check-out time and the woman said we'd be allowed to stay until 2pm with no added fees.  So, we actually got to check out an hour later w/o added charges.  Black hair guy with gel  was an idiot for giving us the incorrect rates/times and for not being helpful.Also, on our last day there, a woman had knocked on our door at 9am, surprised that we were still there.  She was told that our room was vacant.  Then at 11am, a guy just opened up our door w/o warning, waking up my baby from his nap.  And at 1pm, another guy knocked on our door asking if we needed to refill the bar.  Couldn't he just do that after we checked out?If it weren't for the friendly folks we met in Scottsdale outside of the W Hotel, Scottsdale would have left a really bad impression with me.~~#~0
I don't understand what is so great about this place. I got the tacos and it was one of the worst that I ever had. I just moved here and still searching for a great taco place.~~#~0
As a big breakfast lover I was pretty excited when I found out there was a new breakfast place opening with a name as great as Bacon. I figured with a name like that it's gotta be good right? I was wrong. Maybe they have the Swine flu.My boyfriend and I went to Bacon last Sunday for breakfast. I ordered the scrambled eggs with (what else) bacon, potatoes and an english muffin. Boyfriend had french toast.It took FOREVER to get our food. At least 2 tables who sat down after us got their food before we did. When we finally did get our food, mine was cold. The eggs were pretty good but the potatoes were cold and blah and the bacon was thin and just okay. If you're gonna call your place Bacon you should have the best bacon ever! Not the case. Matt's Big Breakfast has much better bacon.At the end of our meal one of the employees came over and apologized for our long wait time and presented us with coupons and invited us to come back. I was pleasantly surprised until I looked at the coupons and realized they expired at the end of April, which at the time was 4 days away! Gee, thanks Bacon!I won't be going back.~~#~0
My husband and I tried this place based on many telling us we should come here for the best Mexican.  It was divey inside, but that was expected- the food was not good at all.  I have seriously had better Mexican food in Connecticut.  I was so disappointed.~~#~0
Because of this Blockbuster..Im now a NetFlix member.. EVERYTIME since Ive moved to N. Phoenix that I have been a paying.. yes, paying customer, you Blockbuster managers.. I have had or witnessed an issue at this place.. scratched movies.. once I get them home.. just to go back and not even get an apology.. wow! you gave me a free movie.. the same one and you act like you did me a favor?! Ugh.. and the attitude and unprofessionalism of the peeps working there.. I mean.. seriously, people.. DONT yell across the store to ask if it was inventoried.. no manners here , whatsoever.. and does the line of people really care that you were completely drunk last weekend.. as you tell your coworker.. No.. we think your an immature slob.. and what the h is that burping sound from the supply room.. Oh wow! ITs a burping coworker.. fantastic~~#~0
First of all, this is not a legitimate boba place. Thanks for the misleading reviews guys.What boba place has only thai iced tea and chai boba? seriously... I asked the lady that was working if she can make a oolong milk tea with boba, and she told me that it was going to watered down since she had to brew the tea. So, i decided to get a thai iced tea with boba. i will give props to the tapioca. it had texture and a sweet flavor. the only thing is that they ran out of the tapioca, so she only gave me like 10 pieces... the tea was pretty watered down.. i could not even taste the flavor of the thai iced tea. If this tea is what she recommended because if I ordered a oolong milk tea it would be too watered down... I don't want to imagine how bad the oolong tea would have tasted. If people think this is a legit boba joint, you are deprived. This store is just a sad wannabe...~~#~0
I've ordered several parts here and it's been ok, not great but ok. This last one, they ordered the wrong part. I went back to try to get the right one but nobody could figure out what an intake flange is. The guy who ordered it called over the parts manager to ask him for help and the guy proceded to just tell me how wrong I was for them ordering the wrong piece. I have never had such a bad experience as a customer. I never once asked for a refund because it's a special ordered piece, and after several attempts to explain to him I was trying to spend more money there and order another piece I just gave up. Now I'm stuck with a $75 piece that does nothing for me. Went to the dealership with the parts and when I showed it to them the kid pulled out 2 catalogs to look at and in 10 minutes he had it ordered, it was $8. Save yourself the headache and wasted money, just go to the dealership or Bob's down in Phoenix where I went when I lived out there. I wanted to try to support a local business and this is what I get, rude people who don't know what they're doing.~~#~0
I am retracting my 4 stars for this airport.  Came in United with 3 hrs to spare.  Looked at tv monitor did not indicate what gate my flight to SJ was.  Thought I was too early so I just lounged around and chilled at the bar.  If it wasn't for the gentlemen serving me, I wouldn't have known that I needed to exit Terminal 2, go outside to the sidewalk and take a bus to Terminal 4 for US airways.  No where did it indicate that I needed to go to another terminal.  I do not know if this is United issue or the airport itself.  They should really spell it out to passengers where they need to go to catch their connecting flight.  After speaking with TSA officer and US airways employees, this is a common problem and many miss their flight because of this.  You need to go through security again when you arrive at another terminal.  Make sure you plan ahead and check you rlights constantly to avoid missed flights!!Terminal 2:  The airport is rather small and quiet.  Not necessarily a bad thing.  There are the usual stores with all your traveling needs and books/magazines.  I flew with United airlines located in Terminal 2.  There's a food court to get sandwiches, coffee.  Round table, Wendy's and a sit down place to eat  Allstars with a bar.  Not too bad.  With free wifi everywhere, who would complain?~~#~0
This place has the perfect storm of terribleness. A handful of UofA fans can ruin any bar but this place is particularly bad. In summary: Bad service, Construction fence around the perimeter, smells of broken dreams, a haven for the worst fans (wildcats, michigan and philadelphia eagles? Who knew you could find all of them in the same place!). Pretty sure I saw a kid, age 10-14, playing cornhole out front too.~~#~0
although it may look like a groove place from the outside my first visit will be the last. sad to think that so many people think this place is good. Food was below average, service was OK but i asked for my drink and got it 20 minutes later. i use to bar tended so i understand how busy it can get but wow! they didn't even care that it happened~~#~0
Wow, a whole list of less than stellar reviews and then two 4-5 stars in one day! By new reviewers even! That haven't reviewed another thing! WOW! What ever could have happened at Mama's to make not one but TWO brand new reviewers feel SO strongly about the quality of their experience there that they would bother to log on and  write a review? I truly want to like Bitzee Mama's. Really I do. So much so that I went back twice more. I know I can be bitchy occassionally so I try to give places more than one shot w/me. The food was average at best but the service just sucked. There were only about 4-5 tables occupied in the whole damn place but yet service was so bad that the customers, myself included, just started getting up and getting what we needed- refills, napkins, whatever. The one waitress, well, I'm not sure if she is truly just slow in the noggin, on drugs or crazy. I could go on but I think you get the picture. I  hope these other "4-5 star reviewers" had that good of an experience there and not just an extra 15 minute break as an incentive.~~#~0
***************CLOSED***************Was getting takeout from P.F. Chang's across from it and took a closer look to see if anything was left inside.  Too bad since it has a great location is an extremely busy peripheral part of Chandler Fashion.~~#~0
This is the worst sub shop in the entire Valley of the Sun. Let me list the problems:1. The sandwich "artists" don't know how to make the sandwich.- Listen, I get it, its a minimum wage, dealing with the ass-hat public, maybe I should go to Phoenix College and get a degree in Nursing so I don't have to work here sort of gig. - But c'mon, when you're putting on 1/2 of what the customer pays for, then give them a shitty look because they want you to do your job right. - Take a shower once in a blue moon. When you walk by me, and my nose hairs are running for cover, you shouldn't be handling food.2. Parking sucks- There are 3 eateries and a Verizon here. With that, if you can find a place to park, you might want to buy some lotto tickets and consider running for Pope that same day.I'm over this place. I am really glad I am moving away so this place isn't my main choice for cheaply, slopply made food.Long story short; don't eat here. Hopefully if the bottom line falls far enough the owner gets the message and finds some people who give half a shit about their jobs.~~#~0
I don't think I get the Z Tejas paradigm.  I've gone here twice for work lunches on other people's dimes, and I can honestly say that the food doesn't make sense to me.  It's like they've taken great Mexican food dishes and then tried to yuppify them so they appear to be hip, trendy, and healthy.  They fail on all three counts and destroy the flavor in the process.This particular restaurant completely forgot about one person's food and he had to eat awkwardly after everyone else was already done.  They comped his meal, but since he wasn't paying for it anyway, it was no consolation to him.No me gusta!~~#~0
Won't be returning to Biltmore Commons DentalDr. Sadowski is a very nice person; however, can you trust a dentist who always recommends the most expensive procedure to remedy a dental problem?  Case in point:  I went to a periodontist for a consultation for implants.  While in his office, I asked if a crown would be needed for a tooth that had chipped a couple of weeks earlier.    He said he didn't like crowns and in my situation all I needed was a gold overlay.  A few days later I was seen by Dr. Sadowski while getting my teeth cleaned.  Per Dr. Sadowski, "The good news is we can fix the tooth:  it needs a crown".  I asked him what other options were available because I had already been told a crown wasn't necessary.  He gave me two other choices, but said that until he started working on the tooth, he couldn't' be sure that a crown would be a necessity.  He had the receptionist price out all three options.  Needless to say, the crown was significantly more expensive than the others.  After I said I was only interested in the gold overlay, the receptionist left to speak to Dr. Sadowski privately.  When she returned she said that she had mistakenly indicated the cost of the overlay by assuming that my dental insurance would cover 80% of the fee.  She said it would actually only pay 50%.  Also, she said that regardless of which option I selected, eventually my tooth would need a crown.  Is it ethical or legal for a receptionist, who has no training or credentials, to advise patients regarding dental procedures?  I said I needed to think about it and left (never to return).  Separate issue regarding the cleaning.  I get my teeth cleaned very 4 - 5 months.  The last visit to Biltmore Commons Dental for a cleaning, I was told that my teeth were in very bad shape and that I needed a more thorough cleaning (which would cost several hundred dollars).  I said that I had just had my teeth cleaned 4 months ago in their office.  The hygienist said that it had been done by someone who was hired temporarily to do clearings and she hadn't done a good job.  Why would I ever go back?~~#~0
Went on a Friday during happy hour,tacos were supposed to be half price,they weren't and they weren't any good either.No booze here  and it didn't feel like any air conditioning. Blech... try Los Dos Molinos for real Mexican food.~~#~0
Went here recently with a lady-friend.  I've been dying to take her here and our vacation gave us the opportunity.She doesn't drink coffee and when she asked what the "barista" recommended that didn't have coffee in it he rudely said, "Go to Starbucks down the street."Despite my natural instinct to choke him, I quietly ordered a coffee as to not start my  vacation badly.My lady and I went outside to have our drinks.  The "barista" left is post and sat outside too, with his friends.  They went on to heckle and by heckle I mean shout loudly, at the ladies entering the tanning salon a few suites over.  They were shouting, "CANCER!", "SUN IS FREE, STUPID!" and such.  Hey, employee at Matador.  They know, they don't care.  Shut up.  I'm pretty sure that shouting at potential customers makes you the stupid one.Oh, yeah.  The coffee was a shadow of what it was and the chai latte my girlfriend got was awful.Never coming to this place again.Man, I miss Mario and co.~~#~0
The location really hurts this theater (being in a mall).  2 things will be guaranteed with this experience: Crowds and Kids.  Things that can ruin any cinematic experience.Additional tip: Assuming it's because of the mall location, but this Harkins Theater charges more than the others...  It's true.~~#~0
Will never go back - first they ruin a St. John suit even after We clearly discussed how it needed to be done, and they said they were accustomed to St. John. Secondly- they promised a gift certificate for all the inconvenience and never sent it. I asked for a linen suit to be washed and sized lightly and they dry cleaned it instead.~~#~0
Eff you McDonalds, eff you! You told me you had "Real Fruit Smoothies" that were blended to perfection and offered at a reasonable price. You drilled that idea in my head for weeks with your incessant advertising on the sides of buses and mile high billboards with pictures of creamy, fruity smoothies that made my mouth salivate instantly. You knew that I loved smoothies so much that I would go to great and dangerous lengths to obtain one of your so called "Real Fruit Smoothies". You knew that even though I loathed you and everything you stand for, that I would risk it all, risk everything to venture into your mustard arches to try one of your smoothies. As soon as I walked in and looked around, I knew immediately that I didn't fit in. I won't get into specifics, but let's just say that many of your patrons have the "I don't have a job and I don't care because I get unemployment checks" look about them. Just sayin'. After I made my way through a throng of screaming kids running around barefoot, I finally made it to the counter. I decided to play it safe and order a strawberry banana smoothie thinking that you couldn't possibly mess that classic flavor up. I wasn't actually able to see you make this "Real Fruit Smoothie", as it was mysteriously whipped up behind the scenes in the back somewhere. I would say that next time I'll pay more attention, but unfortunately for you, there won't be a next time. After I made my way out of that hell hole and into the safety of my car, I took my first sip of your much hyped smoothie. I was instantly disappointed. By the time the liquid mush you call a smoothie hit the back of my throat, I knew that I had been duped. I took one more sip just to make sure that I hadn't missed something the first time, and threw the rest out. McDonald's....come on. You don't make a "Real Fruit Smoothie" by blending up strawberry juice and banana flavored puree with some ice and yogurt and call it a smoothie. You're supposed to use REAL FRUIT! That drink was about as "real" as Joan Rivers face, or Pam Anderson's boobs...you might fool some dumbasses out there, but I think most people would rather pay a few bucks more and get the real deal down the street at Jamba Juice.  I mean, how hard is it to mess up a blended drink? Congratulations McDonald's, you never cease to amaze me....~~#~0
Worst Thai EVER!!!! ZERO STARS. I ordered the jasmine tea, it tasted like tap water. My friend ordered the Pepsi. (can''t mess that up unless its a broken machine.) The soup of the day tasted like egg and bbq sauce! The egg rolls tasted like freezer burn. At this point, I wanted to leave...but we are nice so stuck around to see if the main dishes would redeem this place....hardly. Her main course tasted like urine and my curry dish was so watery!! We told them after taking a bite about it and we heard them laughing in the kitchen about the food tasting like urine. We did not get an apology or anything of the sort to make it right. No one was there but a bunch of kids in the kitchen...are they the ones who run this joint??? This place is disgusting and you could not even pay me to come back or put their garbage in my mouth. .~~#~0
A large group of us made a dinner reservation a month prior, and was told upon being stuck in the corner with two crates for tables that they only take "requests."  The owner came over only to blatantly refuse to take responsibility for the misrepresentation on his restaurant's part and rudely interrupt our attempt to resolve the issue with, "I own other restaurants."  I have never seen such a mistreatment--not even in the snobby town of Scottsdale (no offense, people of Scottsdale).  It was unfortunate, because the waitress (whose section we were sitting while making plans to move our night) was sweet.~~#~0
Nothing special about the food here.  The burger was mediocre (patty is thin and dry), the buns are way too thick and overwhelm the burger itself, and the fries are way too greasy.  You'll fare better going to Johnny Rockets for a burger just a few stores down.~~#~0
Don't go there! Noisy and rude waiters. Never got to eat. After waiting nearly an hour after being told a 20 min. wait, we left. Hostess was especially rude and told us we would need to wait another 20 min.~~#~0
It's an airport. Got it. And given that fact, I have allowed one star for the things that happen that they can not control. But boy oh boy, if I could give zero stars, I sure would. I have flown into this airport 4 times in the last 3 months. And just when I think the experience can't be any worse, Sky Harbor proves me wrong. 1- Possibly the rudest employees ever. From TSA, to the newstand, to Starbucks, they are appalling. 2- This airport is filthy. Toilets are always out of paper or dirty. Floors are not clean, chairs for waiting are consistently dirty. 3-The wait to collect your baggage is atrocious. My average on my 4 visits is 1hour and 5 min each time. 4-The line for checking in is longer than any line I have seen in any airport in any country. If you know you have high volume, then increase your staff. 5-TSA is unhelpful 6-If an airport offers multiple 6 am flights, they may want to consider opening vendors prior to 5:30. I am not writing this review in a bubble. I travel every week and see other major cities get it pretty darn close to right. PHX has a long way to go.~~#~0
We saw the food network show diners, drive ins and dives showcase this place and went there one night for dinner.  It was disgusting.  All 3 of us were very unhappy. Lets just say that now when the host of the show says, "wow, thats tasty" we think it is code for wow that is disgusting!~~#~0
Food was OK but the service was horrible. We went with a group of around 20. It took forever just to get our first drinks and getting a refill was just too much to ask I guess. The worst part was that 1/2 of our table got and finished their food before the second half was served. Literally, down the middle (the long way) because that is how they took the order. Never experienced anything like that. Started at 7:00pm and were there for more than two hours. The night could have been saved with good drink service. Of course since we were a group a 20% gratuity (not %18) was already added to the bill. First and last time eating here.~~#~0
Marcia,Regarding your comments about my 8/28/12 Review.  Your contract is written in plain English and is very straight forward.  In fact it's so simple I understand it completely.  The issue here is that you are showing a complete lack of Integrity by not honoring your written word.  In so doing, you are betting on the fact that I won't hire an attorney to collect the dues ($78.00) that I have paid twice.  Therein lies your SCAM.  If you are so confident in your interpretation of the Agreement, why don't you post it online for all to see??  BUYER BEWARE.~~#~0
Pei Wei makes me sad.  Sad because it is literally the ONLY "Chinese" food a downtown resident of the 5th largest city in the country can get for lunch on a lazy hungover Sunday afternoon.:-(~~#~0
The 3 teenagers behind the counter were bitter & not very helpful. I asked to try one sample & they acted like I'm wasting their time.  I only came here b/c I didn't want to drive to tempe for fro-yo.  I should of made the drive.  I'm not a big Pinkberry fan, and preferred the non-tart flavors.  I had their cappuccino flavor (which was so-so) & had the 3 item toppings which mostly fell out of the cup when the employee carelessly scooped onto the yogurt.  I hope someone will open up one of those self service ones where you pay by the ounce in the East side.~~#~0
I've been waiting in the will call line for over an hour. The staff is just silly emo hipsters who don't seem to care about their patrons. Get shit organized. I could stand this when I was 16, but there are some people who have expectations of a music venue. Plus my ass is sweaty. Which makes me angry.~~#~0
I'm one of those people who remember going here as a child. Haven't been for many many years. Went for lunch yesterday to the Tempe location. Should have had the pizza I guess but the pasta caught our eye so I had the lasagna and my mom had the chicken parmagiana. AWFUL!!  The sauce tasted like it was tomato paste straight out of a can. There was very little mozzarella or ricotta cheese in my lasagna.  My sister had tortellini Alfredo and although the sauce was watery she liked it.  I would only go back to maybe try the pizza but it's unlikely. There are too many good Italian/pizza places nearer to my home.~~#~0
Native Phoenician here. Have been eating at the Tee-Pee for as long as I can remember. One thing that very poignantly stands out is coming back to the Tee-Pee after coming back after living somewhere else for several years. What stands out is the memories of the food. When I left it was good, when I got back it was terrible. The quality of the food has slid slowly into ho-hum-dom, and then further into what am I paying for? If you've read my profile, you'll notice that I'm HUGE on value. Does what you are getting measure up to what you are paying for? If I know I'm getting 5 Star food and service, I'll pay for it. It just seems that things at the Tee-Pee have started to change from really being interested in putting out great food for a great price, to playing off the hype that has become the Arcadia neighborhood hotspot places. It's most disappointing that what was once a favorite hangout, has left me finding other places to get good mexi-chow.~~#~0
I've been going here once or twice a week for the past coupe of months cuz it is close to home.  It used to be ok but lately it has taken a serious turn for the worse. The general manager left (and won't be replaced I'm told) along with their best bartender, and the food quality has absolutely tanked (as in toilet).  What were once tasty bar bites have become poor quality gut-bombs and the entrees have fallen even further than that.  They are always out of at least half of the beers on their menu.  Most ail of the good staff are gone, the place is always nearly empty, and you can usually find the owner, Kwan, on a barstool getting drunk.  The upside is he keeps buying you drinks.  The once cool music selection is now just lame.  Lately, each time I walk up to find the door unlocked I'm a little surprised.  They'll go out of business soon, but til then you can still get cheap (sometimes free) drinks, just be sure to eat before you go.  Scratch that, just go to Goldies.~~#~0
Came here for French onion soup and some spinach dip - soup was cold so we sent it back; 20 minted later they brought the replacement soup and it was even colder so we said no thanks and left.~~#~0
I have ate at some pretty delicious Thai restaurants around town including Thai Hut and Swaddee Thai, so I do know what tasty and flavorful Thai yumminess is like.  We went here after another restaurant had a huge wait and one of my friends picked this as a nearby stand-in that he had ate at.  The interior of Thai Rama is not so attractive and I tried to look past that.  But the food couldn't save it.  Even the sauce you dip your eggrolls in there has an incredily weird texture and taste.  I got some kind of beef dish with medium spice level.  It was so strange and distasteful that I can't remember what it was even called.There's no way I will ever go back, even though my kind friend paid for my dinner.  Thai Hut is right down the street.  Save yourself some money and enjoy better Thai there.~~#~0
I am disappointed.  I wanted to like this place.  My husband and I decided to give this place a try.  Big mistake.  What a waste of a "date night".  It was very busy, so we decided to sit at the bar.  Not a minute after we sat down one of the girls behind the bar broke a glass and shards flew in our direction.  My husband was hit in the face and even pieces of glass were in his hair.  What did this girl do?  Nothing, lifted her head and asked "did I hit you?" my response was, "I think you can see glass all over his hair and in front of him".  Under her breath she said "sorry" and turned around to take care of other people.  I asked someone else at the bar if this is the way they welcome their patrons, because I might be missing something.  Eventually one of the managers came and apologized and bought us a round of drinks.  The sushi is not great, is your typical load of mayonnaise to mask everything.  There are better places for sushi.~~#~0
WHOEVER RUNS THIS PLACE SHOULD BE FIRED!!!!Went here for the Eric Church concert and there was literally a will-call/entry line for 2+  hours!  They are seriously understaffed/have just 2 will call windows, the guys checking IDs were soooooooo slow/drunk/chewing a wad of tobacco about the size of a baseball.  The beer lines were shameful.  No air conditioning!!!!! Can only use your credit card one time (?!?!?!?) so have to have a tab, etc.  Overall an ugly black mark on the Scottsdale/Phoenix music scene.  I'd be ashamed to play here/own this place.~~#~0
I would love to be writing a review right now of JoBot's delicious coffee and scones... but, alas, I cannot because the snob of a barista refused to even acknowledge our presence let alone actually offer to serve us a coffee.  We stumbled upon JoBot on a random Saturday driving through downtown and thought we would stop in for a drink.  There were four or five other people in the place and we took a seat up at the bar.  The barista was in the process of taking another person's order and everyone else appeared to have been served already.  We had no problems waiting while he wrapped up.  Ten minutes later... and he still hasn't said a peep to us, hasn't even made eye contact actually.  The thrill of supporting a local business waned and we eventually (13 min after arriving) got up and left.  It truly felt as though we didn't fit their desired clientele and therefore they didn't want to be bothered with us polluting their hip aesthetic.  Give me Starbucks' friendly baristas over that crap any day.~~#~0
I can't believe this place has 3.5 stars. What a disappointment! The food was bland and cold, the service was ok but my husband and I will certainly never return. Terrible~~#~0
Worst experience ever here! Had my car towed in as it gave out while driving somewhat a few blocks form there place. Eventually I found out it's just a fuel filter issue from Granite Reef Service Center.  Sun Devil Auto wanted to charge me over $700 by charging me 3 times over the price of the parts and labor ((WHAT??!! I told Peire they're Salesman F no!)) I had to involve the Police to mediate the situation and eventually had my car towed to Granite Reef Auto $200 and I was out the door... I'll never go back and deal with this shady place.~~#~0
OUT OF BUSINESS WHEN I STOPPED BY ON 12/15/10~~#~0
Extremly disapointed! I went there for 2yrs for my cat and dog. On my dog alone I spent over 3,000 dollars for various surgeries. I loved my dog very much. I thought they cared too till I ran out of money. My dog ate something that got loged in his belly. I paid over 700 dollars for xrays fluids and tests then they told me they wanted 1500 more for the surgery. I would have gladly given it had I had the money but I was tapped out. They sent me home with some hairball remover hoping it would help him poop it out. My dog hadn't eaten in a week he was going to develop sepsis. I asked for payment plans or any help they could recomend. They said that he needed the surgery or he'd die. I then asked the next day after watching my dog suffer through another night if they could at least put him down. they said no because it was a fixable problem. It was discusting. won't help fix him or end his suffering. These people are money hungry monsters.~~#~0
Dear nothin'-native about New York. You suck.Your pizza is gross and never thoroughly cooked (ie: the crust is doughy and thin), your chicken" strippers" are the size of a baby's thumb...(true story, I totally compared on a 6month old.)Oh.... and did I mention the servers have a terrible attitude, and everything and anything is over-priced.I ordered fried zucchini once (for 6 dollars) and I received 6 nickel-sized soggy things. Really? I could have gone to Carl's Jr's 4 times and been more satisfied, and I don't even like fast-food.Heed my warnings; this place is a total waste.The only thing that is vaugly redeeming is the trivia game system, however; Buffalo Wild Wings has the same thing and you wont feel robbed after leaving.~~#~0
We sat at the outer "patio" and had to search for the waitstaff more than once. When I finally found the one of two servers and asked if there was a waitress for the outer "patio" I was told, "yes there is" and she promptly walked away. Horrible service. Eat TCBY instead. The management should clean house and get rid of these two worthless servers ASAP!~~#~0
I went down to AZ to take a tour of ASU and then head up to Sedona had to stay the night here. Had no idea it was spring training and alot of places were booked.I called ahead they said they had rooms available and would hold one.Me and my friend showed up and walked up.There was a gentleman smoking outside creepy looking and went into the lobby. Ommediatly greeted by a must smell/. Same guy turned out to be the desk clerk and immediatley said no rooms available. I had a hold! he said sorry and we needed to leave!Went to the parking lot and sat in the car for a moment trying to lkook up other places, he came up to th ecar and knocked on it said we had to leave immediately! As we left we saw him completely leave the property into the truck lot and disappeared, looking to score perhaps?~~#~0
If I could give this place zero stars I would. I live not even a block away from this hell crummy place and will drive out of my way to the circle k. I dislike this gas station for a number of reasons. 1. It smells like death. I have been tempted to call and report the hygiene of this place. I've worked in a deli and it does not just smell like "deli meats and cheese".2. The employees are rude. They care less if you're standing at the counter for 5 minutes waiting. Never say thank you or hello. Coming from retail I can appreciate when someone goes out of their way to be friendly. 3. They're products are expired and overpriced. Went to buy some v8 and it was almost a year over expiration. 4. They sell cut in half 30 packs of beer as "15 packs" I'm pretty sure this can't be legal. Honestly, if I didn't hate this place so much I wouldn't care. 5. There hours are inconsistent. They don't have posted hours and they open and close and random hours each day.6. No cash back. This is 2012.7. They won't do "cash fill up" meaning charge my card until the tank is full. Again. This is 2012.Dont waste your time or energy waiting in line at this dump. Drive an extra block and go to the quick mart at 59th and northern.~~#~0
Well, I'll never get that 20 minutes back.  The bad and ugly..not sure there was a good.  I phoned the 7th Ave location of Edible Arrangements thinking it was the closest to my client's office.  There is a $12 delivery fee to drive less than 3 miles.  Seems a bit much to me.I was on hold for over 10 minutes. I think the poor guy on the phone was the only employee working at the time.Overall, the entire experience was unpleasant.  The product seems overpriced, along with poor customer service.  I'd rather give my client a fruit tray from AJ's.~~#~0
Horrible place. the end!they where friendly, kinda. Julienne was there but acted like she had a stick up her ass. should have known, because every time we passed by there's NO ONE in there!~~#~0
I would not recommend Grandma's Kitchen to people with young children. It is supposed to be a kid friendly restaurant. I guess just not for children 3 and under. I admit my son's ages 2 and 3 were a little noisy. But I did not appreciate being told to keep my children quite. Grandma also telling my children to use there inside voices. I immediately responded by saying 2 year olds do not understand what an inside voice is and left the restaurant.~~#~0
WAY OVERPRICED!!!  This is a great place for first timers but i doubt they will be getting frequent customers returning.  Their menu is just too expensive.~~#~0
This review is for this location only.Extremely disappointed. I went to get drive-thru the other day;  I ordered 2 drinks 2 harsh brown, 1 burrito and 2 sandwiches. The server confirmed the order and I corrected her when there was a mistake. I drove by the window and gave her my card. (not to mention her attitude). She handed me the a plain black coffee! (I asked for a Hazelnut Coffee with creme and sugar) Then I went home and took a look. 2 orders of harsh brown were missing. I like Dunkin Donut but I will never go back to this location again!~~#~0
Unfortunately, I have to update my review and take back my previous one. The personal training program is a sham... and way too expensive to risk finding out for yourself. I was with my personal trainer for a month with a strict low-calorie diet and exercising 5x a week (strength training and cardio)... but saw no results. I tried to cancel it, but they had already charged me for two months instead of one (plus the sign up fee and regular gym fees). I spoke to the membership manager who would not refund my money even though my report showed NO weight loss and NO loss of inches. That's fine - keep your money if that's what makes you feel better, rather than understanding a customer who is not satisfied with your program. Very sad to see gyms still operating on the value of a dollar instead of customer satisfaction.I went to a different gym (and signed up with a different trainer) - saw results immediately.~~#~0
Wow. I just wish I could tell the people there on Monday at around 5-5:30, that you are lucky that I punched the fence and not your face.What a nightmare. Most of the dogs there ran over mine, only one stepped up. Apparently her dog just likes to play with little dogs. Really, is that why your mutt attacked mine when we were in between the exit gates trying to leave?  It's ok, he just likes to play, right? I do have to give her some credit because at least she kind of tried (obviously not hard enough). Unlike ALL the others that just sat there. I saw two dogs take massive dumps and no one did anything. This was like a minefield of dump.Then I got the pleasure of stepping in a pile and squishing it into my Adidas. I asked if anyone cleaned their dogs shit, no response. But a couple with an ugly crap dog laughed. Another that repeatedly ran over mine and all they could say, "oh stop pickin on that dog" NOT BOTHERING TO REMOVE THEMSELVES FROM THE BENCH! It took all I had not to show them something that was really funny. My dog getting trampled and yelping and stepping in dog shit, not funny. Taking my poop shoe and rubbing it in your face....now that is hilarious. But I refrained.By the time I pulled that dog off mine (which was followed by someones stupid mouth) I thought, hit the fence out of sheer anger, or go to jail for beating someone? I chose fence. Not a peep came out of peoples mouths then. Don't let the blond hair and small dogs fool you, I will beat you down like your momma obviously should have.If you got a big dog and it chases the little dogs and tramples them, do yourself a solid and CONTROL YOUR DOG. Because the next time, it could be mine that it trampled, and I'm out of free passes on that situation.~~#~0
I hate this place. Seriously  hate this place. I have been coming here for 10 years and they still tell me restrooms are for customers. Never mind that I work at Chase, I'm wearing a badge and a collared shirt and purchasing an ice tea...I'm probably not a customer...I'm probably a crazy vagrant that is going to poop on the floor in the bathroom, yea I said  it, but it wasn't me....It must have been the last person they let use it.. A real customer. Disgusting.. The food here sucks. Their bagels are stale, their eggs are not from a chicken, I don't know where they are from.. Maybe a giraffe (ok the banana bread is good but that's it), their drinks are over priced. And even though the chick behind the counter looks like she is on crack, she must not be, because she certainly can muster the energy to wipe down the counter.  AND THE COFFEE SUCKS!~~#~0
This place is overpriced, poor menu design and flat out unimpressive.  Considering the price tag, I expected a lot more.  This place underdelivered like Alex Rodriguez in the playoffs.~~#~0
I am new to yelp and this story is three years old but time has not diminished its relevance. It was December 2007 and my friend wanted to host her birthday dinner at AZ88 because it was so trendy.  Many from our group shared the bacon wrapped water chestnuts. Each and every person who ate the bacon wrapped water chestnuts was severely ill will food poisoning.  When I complained to the manager of AZ88 he dismissed me, saying, "In my ten years working here, AZ88 has never had a food poisoning complaint."  A dishonest response, no doubt.  Regardless of whether they heard complaints in the past, I was there in the present complaining about four instances of food poisoning from one serving of tainted bacon wrapped appz.~~#~0
bought one dozen donuts..turn out to not to be fresh..never buy donuts on weekday..weekends seems to be fresher.  should be charge day old price.~~#~0
Grew up on east coast and miss NY style pizza after years in Minnesota. Crust doughy, sauce bland. Reminded me of Dominos. A crime to call this NY style pizza.  Never going back.~~#~0
Carefree Resort...not my choice.  I can "care less" about this place.  Rooms smell like a sewer and the employees are not friendly.  I hope I won't be returning!~~#~0
Simple and plain don't waste your time or money...~~#~0
Gross. The carne asada tasted like dog food, and I think my fish was bad. I will never eat here again. (Sorry to the nice guy working behind the counter, I  in no way blame you :)~~#~0
To say I don't get the appeal of Chino Bandido would be an understatement.I don't really need to say anything about this place...just look at the picture above! That's what the food looks like!  Need I really say more?Well, I'm going to:OK, so they serve both Mexican and Chinese food. SO WHAT? It's not even like they serve a hybrid of Mexican and Chinese food. You know, if they served Kung Pao enchiladas, that might be interesting, but this is just Chinese food and Mexican food next to eachother in the same aluminum takeout bowl (yes, even if you'e not taking out). Oh, and by the way, did I mention it's SHITTY Chinese and Mexican food. That being said, if you love Panda Express, you might like the Chinese food at Chino Bandido. If you like super-over-fried, heartburn-enducing flavorless cardboard, you might like their Mexican food. And If you like using plastic silverware to try and cut through said cardboard as it sits in said aluminum take-out bowl while countless shirtless 10-year-olds drool over every dirty inch of your favorite restaurant, then this might just be your favorite restaurant.On the plus side, they give you a free cookie.~~#~0
I see other diners had similar experiences as we did. I want to support local family owned businesses, but I would never go back to this place. The family tried hard and kept asking if everything was OK. What do you say? The food is all just really awful? And why don't they know that?They should never even have been open yet. They need to finish remodeling. Get rid of the broken Fuji Buffet sign as you walk in and the graffiti on the door. The tables and buffet lines, decor, are all from two restaurants ago.We were told to take any table we liked. They all looked dirty.Normally in a buffet there are little signs on the sneeze shield that tell you what the dishes are. There were post it notes. In poor hand writing. And they didn't always match the food.The Cesar salad was a pan with about 2 inches of creamy water and lettuce and soggy croutons floating in it. I tried several different dishes, but the only thing that I even remotely liked was a stuffed tomato.While my niece was up getting food, a man came out with a big can of chocolate pudding and "glopped" it in. Probably not the best choice.  A lot of overcooked, poorly seasoned food. I see some people had hummus. I looked in vain for hummus or pita bread. But there were jalapeno poppers, egg rolls, chicken nuggets and onion rings.We also witnessed the argument over the drinks and also had our drinks refilled from a glass.I feel they were earnest but were incredibly wide of the mark.~~#~0
Overpriced and service is not friendly. You can buy cheaper indian groceries at Lee Lee's Oriental Market.~~#~0
This was the most amazingly unfriendly and unsanitary hospital I have been to in a while...It took the staff one hour to figure out that I needed more than two Tylenol for a fever of 103 (this is after waiting for 2 hours in a room full of coughing people that weren't required to wear masks), and I was severely dehydrated, but it didn't seem to matter to anyone.  Not to mention the annoying front desk dude who kept talking in high pitched voices because he thought he was hilarious.  It didn't even seem like he understood how to run a Debit card after trying to swipe mine five different ways to get it to work (my card was brand new, so there definitely wasn't anything wrong with it).  Can we get some competent people up in here?!?The physicians charge a separate fee from the hospital, so don't be surprised if after you have paid your co-pay, that you still owe a physicians fee, and whatever else your insurance didn't cover.  Needless to say, I will NOT be coming back to this hospital.~~#~0
Dined at Crust on a slow Friday night.  My wife and I ordered an app  for a starter, and two entrees.  We received the app soon after we ordered, but the entrees took over 45 minutes, maybe just under an hour, to arrive after we received the app.  I asked the waiter where our food was, and how soon will we get it.  He said 3 minutes, it took a lot longer then 3 minutes.  At one point the waiter asked us what we ordered.  I'm guessing he asked that, because he forgot to place the order, or lost the ticket.  We have had a few good meals in there, but the last 2 have been terrible.  We won't be back!~~#~0
Service was good, food was horrible. Nothing had flavor, food was cold, tasteless and gross. We had to run through McDonald's to get my wife something and that was better than good china.  Would not recommend it~~#~0
I just had a terrible experience at La Piccola Cucina!I've been to this restaurant several times in the past and enjoyed the home-style cooking.  Needless to say, I was very excited when a voice daily deal came out that allowed me to purchase a $30 food voucher for $15!This place is on my way home from work, so I saved the coupon for a night that I was working late - excited to grab some delicious takeout on the way home.One of the servers was in the middle of taking my order when the owner of the restaurant saw that I had the coupon.  He snatched it angrily out of my hand shouting "this is only good for 2 people dining in - not take out!"  I informed him that this restriction was not stated anywhere on the coupon that I had purchased and he shouted back, "I don't care!  That's the way it's always been!"  In a restaurant full of other diners, the shouting continued until I was embarrassed enough to leave...I just can't believe how completely rude and belligerent he was to me - In my opinion, this is no way to ever treat your valued customers.I will be demanding a refund on my coupon and won't be returning to this restaurant again.~~#~0
We tried this restaurant because we had received a gift certificate as a gift. Thank goodness it didn't cost us anything to eat there. 3 of us had bowls of Potato Bacon soup with a pieces of  "bread." If there was any bacon in this soup, none of us saw it or even tasted it. The "bread" they served with it was hard and neither the soup or the bread had any taste. I kept adding pepper but you can only add so much of that to soup before it tastes yucky. The other person in our group got the lunch combo of 1 piece of pizza (Cheese) and a salad. The price for this combo was expensive, which you don't mind if the food is good, but in this case it added another layer of annoyance. When it came, she asked the server where the dressing for her salad was and he told her it was on the salad. She asked him to show it to her as she didn't see any and then he said perhaps they had forgotten it. He brought her some dressing that was the consistency of peanut butter and looked very unappetizing. She tried it with a little lettuce and said it wasn't too bad (what a compliment, huh?) but the slice of pizza was tasteless. Tasteless food and high prices - not a good combination. We WILL not be coming back here.~~#~0
It's not down-home BBQ; hell, it's not even GOOD BBQ. However, if you have more money than taste, Bobby Q will suit you just fine (doucher-heaven). Apparently this is not a national chain, but they sure did make it look, taste, and act like one. The waitress sounded like a sad, embarrassed corporate robot giving us a memorized recitation about their aged beef stash and some special "gourmet" appetizer that is actually just a taquito (yawn). The chicken and pulled-pork were both CHEWY, not tender, and the pork is FATTY (CHUNKS-O-FAT) and had to be picked through. The sauce on the chicken is an ABOMINATION and shouldn't even be referred to as BBQ SAUCE. PORTIONS ARE SMALL! The corn bread is DAMP with greasy vegetable oil and falls apart in your hand. An old, dusty flap of kale was laid on the plate for a garnish. Many reviewers mention the tiny, OIL-SOAKED, mini-donuts that the hostesses are making (as a side job/not much training) by the door on the way out as something that really impressed them. How drunk must they have been at that point? It's just depressing to even think about really...A place better forgotten...~~#~0
Embarrassment - every single time. This is a nice area... A really nice area, but the trash seems to flock to this Walmart from miles around. Fact: I've sent in so many pictures to peopleofwalmart.com from this location! Where in the h*ll do they come from and why here?! Today, I practically watched a ghetto women beat her children and scream at them bc she wanted to check herself out in a pair of walmart's hottest sunglasses and they kids wouldn't stop asking her questions. It was so bad that my daughter told me she was scared. Customers were staring, the employees did nothing. So embarrassing. The remodel is most likely going to look great when finished ... But by reading precious posts, I think the damage has been done for this location, and a shiny new facade can't change it's reputation as the "scary Walmart". Head to Desert Ridge and go to Target Greatland or Home Depot. At least you'll feel safe.~~#~0
So I knew I wanted to go to a midnight screening of  the Dark Knight pretty much since the movie was first announced. I also knew that I should buy my tickets well in advance because this thing was going to be not just huge, but GINORMOUS (sp?)! However, since my life is filled with indecisive people, I had to wait to the last minute to buy tix. When I was finally able to ascertain exactly how many tickets I needed to purchase, Harkins @ Tempe Marketplace was completely sold out, much to my chagrin. So, I traveled a couple of miles down the 202 to Cinemark at Mesa Riverview.I approached the ticket booth and asked the pimply teenager if there were any tickets left for any of the midnite showings of TDK. He said yes there were, they had about 25 tickets for each auditorium reserved for people who bought tickets online. This confused me, so I attempted to clarify: "so, I need to go home and buy the tickets online?". His response was "no, I can sell you the tickets here"...okay...so why the whole speech about the tix being reserved for online purchase? Then...it get's better, oh yes it does...he tells me "the seats will probably be right up front though". Okay, "is it assigned seating?". "No". "So, if we get here early, it won't be a problem right?". "I guess not". So at this point I am completely baffled. Is this guy stalling? What is with all this needless banter? Anyway, I finally purchase my tickets and make my merry way home.That night, we get to the theatre about an hour before the show. Somehow they've already let everyone into the theatre, which was a little odd. But we still managed to find decent seats. I went to the concession stand and I swear the girl filling my popcorn must have been the ticket guy's twin brain. I asked for a regular size water bottle and she responded "we only have two sizes, big and small". The "small" looked a lot like a regular size bottle of water to me. Then she had to ask me twice which soda I wanted and what size popcorn (which was the foulest popcorn I've had in a movie theatre in about a decade). Back in the auditorium a nasty, bitter assistant manager kept yelling at different members of our party because we weren't all in our seats (we were out at the concession stand or in the bathroom) and kept trying to give our seats to other people. I must say, that really topped off the day. So, yeah...despite the crowds, despite the noise, I think I'll stick with Harkins.~~#~0
Bought a special to try them out.  They didn't show up on first scheduled date.  I spoke to owner.  Thought we might have had a miscommunication.  I rescheduled for another day.  That was today; spoke with owner at 8 a.m. this morning, confirmed that crew would arrive at 11:30 a.m.  It's now 2:00.  I have left 4 messages and not received a call back. It is now one week later.  They didn't show up and owner never called me back.  The other reviews say they are great.  I'll never know!!!~~#~0
I went into this shop with the simple issue of a loose heel on a pair of Charles David peep-toe pumps. In hindsight, I should have just bought myself some Gorilla Glue and done the repair myself. These were my MOST favorite shoes and they butchered them. What did they do? Let me count the ways:1. Scratched and scraped the acrylic heel all over2. Screwed two GIANT screws into the heel from the inside of the shoe3. To try and cover them up, they inserted a humungous pad...that was dirty...and it elevated my foot almost to the point of it no longer being in the shoe at all.4. Glue. Everywhere.5. Must have had it in some kind of vice while being heated because it is completely misshapen. When I brought all of these things to the attention of the man at the counter (as I was fighting back tears, literally) he looked at me and said "you still have to pay".I will never, ever go back here and would not recommend this place to anyone. If I could give zero stars, I would.~~#~0
MARKET: this place sucks. Never in my life have I ever felt so disrespected by a worker. I don't know how they do things over in Saudi, but you don't disrespect your customers here. Right when I walked in, I had to maneuver around the old fat guy who smelled like old rice and was watching TV. He mumbled something in Arabic about me being in the way when i walked by. I greeted him and he ignored me. I proceeded to help myself to smelling the Shisha, but he started yelling at me saying that that it can't be touched unless I was going to buy. I explained that I wanted to try a new flavor and asked for his opinion, but he played the "no english" card. I picked the flavor I wanted and brought it to the register and said I was ready and was ignored, so as I walked out the door I told him something he would definitely understand, and it was that he was a khanith. This place needs to keep grandpa off the sales floor and put him in a home, because I have found haji baba just a few hundred yards down the road, and me and my friends take all of our business there.~~#~0
Worst service in town.. and the drinks were next to atrocious!~~#~0
They could not do an oil change on a 2010 Kia Sedona - no oil filter in spite of the two auto parts store in the same block. Friendly, but do some problem solving guys?~~#~0
The dead walk amongst us.  This location is D-E-A-D and they're down to hawking the fixture's on the street. You might find some last ditch deals but you probably need to do so by month's end (Feb 2009).  Looking dire on this end of Mill Ave.Thanks Tempe Marketplace for killing what was once cool.~~#~0
I was visiting town on a business trip and we stopped into Fleming's for a mid-week dinner.  The visit wasn't a complete flop, but close to it...  If the ribeye was in fact a "prime" ribeye, they did one heck of a job cooking all of the flavor out of it.  To mask the horrible grill work, they covered the steak with more salt that was necessary for the entire cow.  I've been lucky enough to dine an a wide array of steak houses that claim to serve "prime" steak, and this is the bottom of the list.I would not recommend this restaurant for a large group as the atmosphere is quite loud.  We had six people at our table and a conversation that included everyone was not possible.To end on a positive note, the servers and wait staff were terrific.  They are easily on-par with other prime steakhouses around the country.  Regarding the item on the menu that I enjoyed the most was the sweet chili calamari.~~#~0
It seems like when this place gets a sick animal the first thing they do is push you off on someone else, they can't be bothered.  My Black Lab was mis diagnoised with thyroid cancer, they said it was a fat mass and wouldn't biopsy it, my yellow Lab swallowed something that got stuck in his intestines, they took blood work and said they would call in the morning.....I ran him right out to Cave Creek for an ultrasound, we were sent to a hospital a block away and took him in for emergency surgery, he would not have survived the night.  I believe if you dog needs only shots, your probably safe, anything else...run, run far away.  They don't care about your animals.  There are so many caring and outstanding vets who truly care about animals, get away from these people!!!~~#~0
This place sucks mega nuts~~#~0
Was served two flat beers, the pizza for my two year old came out cold, along with cold stiff fries.  The salads were fine, the shrimp I served was good.  The service they do have down, the wait staff was gracious and did the best they could.  The back kitchen needs SERIOUS work... SERIOUS work.  I will wait for a long time before I go back again.~~#~0
LOUD. The walls are paper thin, and I didn't know this was a party hotel until it was too late. As in five am and people were still partying and I could hear every word through a closed door. There was urine in the toilet when we arrived, which made me wonder if anything had been cleaned. We had to open a window on a cold day because the room smelled bad.  Fifty cents worth of candy and pop and very spotty wifi should not amount to a $17 "resort" fee. Lame channels only on tv and not great reception there either. Deluxe Philosophy toiletries were a joke too: it was a bar of drying soap and a tiny bottle of lotion that didn't smell all that great. It's silly that they advertise these as enticement. We wanted to use the exercise room before dinner but would have had to walk through the restaurant's waiting area and then some hospital's Christmas employee party to get there and back! I could only recommend this place to rich kids on spring break. One star for being a local business, as badly as it might reflect on Phoenix. The one nice thing? A comfortable bed with nice sheets that you won't sleep a wink in.~~#~0
Walked in, stood at the hostess desk until someone from the kitchen (we think) told us to seat ourselfs, sat down for about 10th minutes with waitresses passing us ten times. We finally left. It was not busy. Lousy service. Will not return.~~#~0
Bagels were worthless, potatoes were tasteless, french toast cut inconsistently so half was undercooked. Veggies and bacon looked unappetizing.  Bialys are glorified onion rolls. Prices are inflated (scottsdale lol). Everyone's food came out at different times. Every time we asked for coffee server carried individual cup to carafe instead of bringing pot to table. Waitresses seen playing with hair. If this was NY, they'd be shut down in a week.~~#~0
Me and my wife tried this place for the first time yesterday.... what a mistake!I had the Pad Thai with shrimp and steak, it was horrible!!!! the steak tasted like leather, the shrimp tasted like rubber balls of bland white fish. I will not go back, my wife's meal was horrid also...An off night? don't know, but if it tastes like this all the time, they will not be in business much longer...Guaranteed!!~~#~0
MAGGOTS!!!! I wish I could leave a -5 rating on here for Chen & Wok; we have eaten takeout for here for years and always enjoyed it for our greasy Chinese fix. But last night we found fu¢king MAGGOT in our broccoli. We took it back, got our money and raised a huge stink...other diners also came up to get their money back. That is by far the MOST disgusting experience I've ever had from eating out and I worked in food service for years so I've seen some pretty nasty things. NEVER EVER EAT HERE!!!! I will be calling the health department on Monday. I couldn't believe the girl said, "Well it was probably just something from the vegetables but I'll give you your money back anyway." Seriously?! It's a fu¢king MAGGOT!!!! So for anyone considering enjoying good ole Chen & Wok, let me say it again....MAGGOTS!!!!!!!!!!~~#~0
This place isn't a "bar..." Its just a joke.What bar in its right mind shuts down at 9:50 on a Saturday night? Evidently Christoper's is the only one that comes to mind.We walked in on a Saturday, sat down as there were still some 20 people sitting around having drinks, and were quite brusquely informed that they were closed and that we needed to leave. We asked what all the other folk were doing there, and we were informed that they were regulars and friends and that closing didn't apply to them.The only time we'll be going back to Christoper's is when its closing for good to mock the owner as he locks the door one last time. Until then, this place can kiss my lily white ass.~~#~0
So bad.  The food was inedible.  Salad was awful weak dressing mixed greens with bland cheese.   Fries and onion rings mushy.  2 items i wanted both not available.  No veggie patty option.  Service was awesome which is the only reason we did not walk out.  Unpleasant.  Hubby and i have been tummy sick all night.  Bummer.  Really wanted to like it.~~#~0
Bad Pizza, very bad pizza... I think most people are being very generous to say it's OK. I love the atmosphere here, the organ is great... Very bad pizza. I can only imagine how great this "once every 5 year" place could be if they had even "good" pizza, it would not even have to be great! Another yelp-er, compared this place to going to the grand canyon, you know, something you got to do.  I agree you need to go here... I actually brought my own pizza from Old Chicago, the last time I went... No one even tried to stop us. I think the wait staff understood, every time they passed our table they smiled. We got ice cream for desert and also left a big tip... This place has Pizza in it's name I would give more stars if they called it Organ World and charged for admission.~~#~0
Do you seek crowded spaces? Douche baggery? The same over-played hip hop music you hear everywhere and overpriced drinks? If you said yes to any of these questions than boy do I have a place for you! Zuma! We went there after midnight on a TUESDAY and it was PACKED. You can't reach the bar easily and apparently the lines to as well as the condition of the bathroom was bad. If you are looking for the whole hip-hop dancy thingy on Mill then go to Vintage. Cheaper drinks and less crowds but the same douche baggery and overplayed hip-hop.~~#~0
Ouch & GROSS!  Expensive and Disgusting!!  "Cal-Ital" food...How stupid.Honestly, I ordered the number one listed and recommended item on the menu seafood carbonara pasta dish, and it was absolutely tasteless.  It tasted like wallpaper paste!  It was surprisingly awful, since it is owned by Cowboy Ciao across the street, which is very good.For good carbonara, go to Uncle Sal's - formerly mafia owned by Sammy "The Bull" Gravano.  I choose good food over decore anytime!~~#~0
One star from a vegan perspective. This is a great restaurant if you love meat and cheese. You can even get away with being vegetarian here if you like lots and lots of cheese. But when I asked the waitress if there was anything on the menu that could be made without cheese, she looked at me like I was retarded and said, "You really should just order a salad."I knew what I was getting into when we came here, so I was prepared to eat something doused in cheese, but I bet other restaurants/chefs would have at least tried to accommodate a request like that. I even asked if the chili relleno could be stuffed with the beans/rice side dish instead of cheese, and the waitress said no (the beans are made with pork broth anyway, so it was a moot point). Oh well. It is very rich and tasty food, but if you are strict vegan and you come here with a group (which would be the only reason a vegan would even walk in the door), eat at home or plan to stop at Green afterwards.~~#~0
Mediocre food coupled with subpar service. Got turned down for Sake Bombing at "Sakebomber". Not to mention the interrogation at the front desk to be served alcohol. Definitely will not return.~~#~0
This is the Cinnabon inside the Phoeniz airport! It is not a real Cinnabon. The coffee was not Cinnabon coffee. It was shared with the Burger King next door. Yuck.The roll was not fresh. Threw it away half-eaten.~~#~0
You must have at least 4 people in your group to have a table to yourself!  I used to have a lot of business meetings with clients at this place (at least twice a week) as it was right down the street from my office.  The food is not great and the service is unusually horrible but they have a big selection for my business clients to choose from as most have different tastes and it is more of a relaxing environment in which most like. One Sunday, 2 friends and I were having lunch at a table for four people.  They sat a stranger with us to have lunch....very awkward, but was okay as we were all drinking beers.  About two weeks later (on a Friday), I was entertaining potential clients discussing our company and answering other questions.  There were three of us sitting at a table for four people.  They had the "balls" to sit another guy at our table as they say they were now sitting groups together to fill all spots.  I told the manager that we were discussing business as he seemed to not care and still sit the guy with us.  Needless to say, I have never returned to a zipps and never will.~~#~0
Personally, I am insulted when someone visits Phoenix and asks me to take them to a Macayo's. The other reviews' analogies to Denny's and TGI Fridays are spot on. I would add Olive Garden to the list of good comparisons. Would you go to Italy and ask your host to take you to a McDonalds? I understand that the company apparently has a well-oiled marketing machine in place, since many out-of-towners seem to know about it the moment they get off the plane. If I was reviewing marketing departments I guess they'd get 5 stars. But I honestly can't think of a scenario where going out to eat at Macayo's would ever be worthwhile or necessary. Maybe, your car runs out of gas right at the intersection of Central and Clarendon and you have a disease that will kill you if you don't eat within the next 20 minutes? But then, Fez is right there. Oh, but the disease specifically requires you to eat Mexican food or you'll die? Fine. That's what Blue Burrito is for, but at lower prices and less time (not to mention less calories). So again, why dine at Macayo's?If you do want to eat there, please, just avoid hurting my feelings and do it behind my back.~~#~0
The building is nice but the service absolutely sucks!  Unemployment is high enough to fire the lazy bellman and replace them with people who want to work. Getting a cab took 30 minutes. The bellman spent 10 mins talking BB to his buddy....~~#~0
To be fair, this is not my typical scene. But even if it's not, a good place should draw my interest, no matter its target clientele. Instead, the people working there are a mix of aggressive bouncers and airheaded bartenders. I was disappointed. Not only are their well drinks pretty pricey, but the music just plain uninspires. I spent a while on the rooftop bar and wondered why everyone was enjoying themselves. The DJ played the same boring, unoriginal beat 1,000 times over and over, yet people were eating it up. I think I'm not cool enough to understand. I heard they're under a new general manager, so maybe this place will get better. The space is great, but the atmosphere is such a bummer here that I can't be any kinder.~~#~0
This was a bad experience all around.  I went on a Wednesday morning when it was really slow and still the service was bad.  The waitresses were busy complaining to each other out-loud about their personal life and airing their dirty laundry.  I'm assuming they don't assign servers to certain sections because they debated who was going to take my order.  This made me feel very appreciated of course... except for no.  After I got my meal, they never asked if I needed anything, not even a coffee refill.  Then they just gave me the bill and still didn't ask if I needed anything else.  If they put as much thought into their jobs as they do the number of tattoos they have, things might have been great.As for the food, I would rate the Bacon and eggs at 2 stars.  I would give the pancakes 1 star because they were chewy and hard to cut into.What's worse is that the food was WAY overpriced.  Coffee, Bacon and eggs, plus one pancake, came to around $13.  I believe this place is part of a local chain.  Even so, I will never return to this place or any of their other locations if the management can be this clueless about how their place runs.~~#~0
I was out on errands & getting hungry, so I stopped into this place today for lunch.  I see these "Long Wong's" places all over town, but this is the first time I've tried one of them.  Here's how it was at this one:First off, it's a real dump, ala Taco Bite.  Part of the menu is up on a board behind the counter, & the rest is strewn around all over the walls & on erasable boards.I ordered a "Special" from the listless counter girl, which was promoted as 6 hot chicken wings & a cheeseburger for $4.95.  You have to pay BEFORE they fix the food, & before you can beg to go to the bathroom to wash your hands.  (It lives behind a locked hallway door that has a big sign on it saying that you can't use the bathroom!)They wouldn't trust me with the hallway-to-the-bathroom door key, but instead I had to wait for girl to go let me in!  Once inside the bathroom, it's a good thing I didn't have to go, because not only doesn't the door lock, it doesn't even CLOSE!  You pull it closed & it opens back up a foot or two, I guess so that the staff can keep an eye on you in there!Back out in the dining room, I took a seat in a booth.  Next to it was a window with big, heavy bars on it like a jail!  I brought a book to read, but I couldn't hear myself think, because the TV on the wall was blabbing out, so I sat.  It was cold in there, too.  It's no wonder they make you pay first!  Otherwise I would have left.So then in a little while girl brought out my food.  The cheeseburger bun was REFRIGERATOR COLD, & the "6 wings" were actually THREE, because they count each side of the wing as a wing.  Also, they were the tiniest chicken wing pieces I have ever seen, not more than 2 inches long each.After eating this dinky meal my fingers were all gooey, but I didn't feel like going through the hassle of trying to get girl to let me into the bathroom again to wash my hands, so I drove home with them like that.  When I got home, I washed my hands & fixed myself something to eat.Eek!~~#~0
I've actually been to this place a few times, and thought the Korean food was pretty decent.  I took my parents and younger brother here very recently when they came to visit.  They wanted Korean food, and I kind of wanted to eat sushi, so we drove here.  They ordered the standard kalbi and bulgogi while I opted for the all you can eat sushi.  A few minutes later, I handed the waitress my piece of paper with my selections (IIRC you can select up to five or so items at a time)So why the one star rating?  Wall of text incoming.  If you don't want to read it all, just skip down to the bottom.The waitress was rude when I said I wanted AYCE.  She told me there was no sharing.  In a friendly way, I told her I knew what the 'rules' were and that it wasn't anywhere near the first time I'd had AYCE.  She then told me that I'd be charged if I wasted any sushi.  *yawn* I know (protip: really no place is going to charge extra unless you order an excessive amount and intentionally waste the food).  She then proceeded to tell my bro that he couldn't eat any of the sushi.  Seriously, we know lady.My family was close to finishing their food by the time my sushi came out..my first order.  No, not because they ate fast...but because at least 35 minutes had passed since I handed the waitress my order.  I mentioned it to her, and she told me it was because there were a lot of people ordering sushi.  I looked around and there were 2 people at the sushi bar, and I saw maybe 2 tables that ordered sushi also.  It doesn't take that long to cut the fish (it wasn't even cut well).I had my next piece of paper ready as soon as my food came, hoping that the next order would come before I made my family wait too long.  This order was brought out much quicker...only about 10 minutes...only I received 1 of the 5 items that I had marked.  The waitress asked me if I got everything I wanted.  Uhh..no?  I didn't want to deal with the crappy service any longer, so I asked for the check and told her I'd just go get some fast food.As we go up to pay, the guy at the counter (the owner I think) asks how everything was.  My mother tells him that it was okay, but that I had barely had anything.  He says something about how they only had one sushi chef that night bla bla bla.  I roll my eyes and we leave that place, never to return.If you want Korean food, I will admit their Korean food is ok.  But it doesn't matter how decent your food is when the service is crapolicious.  I won't be going back to Takamatsu, except maybe to give them the link to this review.Horrible service.  .If you are in the area, go to Chodang or Hodori for comparable food and much, much better service.~~#~0
The food is absolutely terrible at this Qdoba, or maybe it is all Qdoba's I don't know.  Either way, Qdoba does not stack up to Chipotle.  Better than Someburros?  Nope.  Better than Filliberto's?  Not quite.  Better than Taco Bell?  Doubtful.  Better than a Hot Pocket?  Yes, but what isn't?~~#~0
I went to the grand opening of the new location of Primp and Blow with high hopes. They sent me an e-mail for the kick off event advertising free eyebrow waxing and make-up applications. The e-mail was quite timely because I was in need of having my eyebrows waxed. When I got there about 5:20pm they seemed quite busy and disorganized. Which honestly, I can understand for a grand opening so I tried to cut them a little slack. When I asked the girl at the front desk about eyebrow waxing she seemed unsure what I was talking about, said she would write down my name and ask, that I should check back with her in 10-15 minutes. When I checked back the next girl I talked to had put me on the list and said it would be about 15 minutes to just come and check back at the desk. After another 15 minutes I checked back and got the same response. This happened a few times. I finally was taken back to have my eyebrows waxed around 6:20pm. Yes, an hour after I got there. Thnakfully they had some yummy food and good music for the grand opening so still trying to give them the benefit of the doubt here. The girl that took me back never introduced herself, so I do not know the name of the person I am reviewing. At the very beginning I explained to her my brows are very simple, I just do a little underneath and a little in between my brows. I told her I didn't need shaping, just keep the shape I have and clean up the hair underneath my brow. The first thing she does is put wax ABOVE my eyebrow. As you know, once wax is applied there is only one way it is coming off. :-( So she waxed the top of one brow even though I specifiaclly told her just underneath and between. Yikes, but can't undo it now.Then she does between and underneath, does a quick pluck of a few strays and says she is done. Um ok...I've never had them not hand me a mirror when they are done.... bad sign. So I hop up to look in the mirror only to find out that she went way thinner than the natural shape of my brows! Way thinner than I ever go. When I mention this to her she say "wow, and I never shape, I just follow the line of the brow." Well....that's not true because mine are now scary thin. =( Nothing I can do to get them back but just wait. And hope they grow back in the way I used to have them. So while I was clearly not happy with my thin brows (even though I am still trying as best I can to be nice at this point) I didn't even receive an apology from her. Nothing... I was very disappointed in my experience here and will not be returning to have anything waxed in the future.On a side note, a few friends went that night for blowouts and make-up applications. They were split. A couple liked their hair and not their make-up, a couple liked their make-up and not their hair. And one friend left nearly in tears because she hated both her hair and make-up so much. Not so great for opening night when you are trying to do your best to get return customers.~~#~0
Ridiculous! I have gone to the McDonalds next to this place every morning this week and even though the signs say they open at 7:00, they have yet to be open even by 7:15. I'll find another place to wash my car.~~#~0
Good place to get drinks. But the sushi here is awful. Very skimpy cuts of fish and I find when I go to their flying fish sunday night the sushi tastes and smells fishy. (sushi should never smell) The service has been slow every time I've been there. If you want good sushi in Tempe go to Kabuki or Sushi Eye.~~#~0
This is the WORSE Fry's I have ever been too. My boyfriend and I live a block a way and we drive all the way up to Tatum and Shea to grocery shop just to avoid this Fry's. The store is ALWAYS FILTHY, The employees are ALWAYS unhelpful. Not Once, Not Twice, but Three times we have been standing at the self checkout with the machine yelling, attendant has been notified because god for bid we didn't bag something in time and the attendant COMPLETELY Ignores this and continues her conversation with a co-worker. So finally we got fed up and we started going through the regular checkout, where the cashier proceeded to make bird noises at me and then the absent minded boy who bagged my groceries just threw all the canned goods directly on-top of my bread, which is such a cliche but I guess for a reason. This Fry's is just ridiculous and not worth shopping at~~#~0
If there was a -negative star I would use it.  Unhappy servers who looked like androids from that movie zombies retuning from the dead! Took a break from studying college math to get a root beer float. Purchase drove back home to savor and watch favorite tv drama and dang no root beer seltzer. Had to drive back for refund. No offer of making for free considering high gas prices and 2 trips. Went back a week ago with God daughter to get 2 milk shakes they were terrible. Whip cream was nasty and no choc in chocolate shakes. We had to remake and remove whip throw up cream and add Hershey to make it chocolate. Two thumbs down no Sonic for me!~~#~0
Normally Nello's to-go lunch is great - not today!   My co-worker found a worm in her half turkey club sandwich!     We called and talked to Shea the manager who condescendingly said that although Nello's washes their lettuce they can't help that a worm won't get off the lettuce.   Now we know the little green worm is quite little, but we are particular that our protein intake not be alive and moving.   With all the lunch providers in Ahwatukee and with the holiday season you would think Nello's may have been apologetic and even a little generous.   We weren't expecting our entire $40 ticket to be comped, but when we asked if I could receive some compensation, Shea responded by saying they can replace the half sandwich/salad if my co-worker came back in that day.   Not even an apology and a $10 gift card.  I guess the Ahwatukee Nello's has a manager who doesn't really believe in a high level of customer service.   I wouldn't have posted this if she would have been a bit kinder in her tone and generous by only a few more dollars.   It really is all about how people are treated - I hope Shea's staff is treated better than we were.~~#~0
I could not believe how terrible this store is.  They are new at this location and the first day I go to sell something, which was like Memorial day I think, they are closed, so I go back and they offer me $70 for my guitar.  I said I would think about it and they said come back in and we will give you the $70 if you do decide to sell it.  So I take it back in a week later with a few other items and they say $65 for everything. I could not believe it, they said well maybe you should have taken it at that time.  They are ripping people off, giving them low dollar amounts for their items and then jacking up the price to almost 3 times what an item is worth.  They were selling a used play station in there for $450. I will never recommend this place.~~#~0
If there is a ZERO Star rating, this is what this overrated place would have gotten.  In a smelly dumpy shopping center, I thought I was in a Baskin n' Robbins, but that would have been cheaper and better.  I can't beleive all the sheep that go to this place.  Once was enough.  Nothing special, nothing memorial...except for the sign in the window...."Hiring fun, enthusiastic scoopers'.  I wanted to add to that sign..."To replace the unenthusiatic one that is currently working!".~~#~0
The one star goes to the raspberry iced tea. Other than that the place is pretty unsatisfactory. I went in with no expectations at all and was still let down. If you want a Mexican food restaurant I'd have to recommend go to tacobell up the street!~~#~0
I just had to... I'm writing this post mortem (BTW)Running late to a Saturday soccer match.  Needed some "fast food."  Although I've seen "Super Size Me," we were in unfamiliar territory.  Typically for me, anything west of 7th street is considered east California.  Guilty, I don't know my way "round the west side."This is why I don't like Mc Donalds.Ordered the Big Breakfast (plate of shit)."Light fluffy scrambled eggs, savory sausage, a flaky buttermilk biscuit, crispy hash browns and three golden brown hotcakes. Could it get any better?" per mc donald's web site.  golly f-ing geez, put and adjective in front of anything, and i'll eat it: : savory, flaky, crispy, golden diarrhea dog turd.  Y.U.M.M.Y.I got a square egg patty.  swear to jesus.  square (think it was to go to an egg mc muffin)pancakes.  and biscuit yummy.sausage. greasy.  seriously? okay, i knew it would be greasy.had to ask for my hash brown (was forgotten), so the nice lady gave me two.  and then i had a heart attack.  unfortunately, no one working there was smart enough to call 911, so i died.lo siento, pero no mexicans working there AT all, so service was SLOW.  Every senior citizen, bless their little old hearts, was in line in front of me.  and.  I SWEAR TO GOD the cashier had to get her phone out to add.So I ate my last meal, took a Lipitor, but it was too late.  I died.  No one called 911, since the staff can't read nor add, and the elderly didn't have cell phones.~~#~0
bad website. ordered take out over the phone and not very helpful....no specials . asked if i was trying to contact the old restaurant...let see how the food is..f ing terrible.. i want my money back they use CANNED PEAS!!! who does that? and they charged me wrong..~~#~0
I bet Barneys has so many weird faceless blue mannequins to fill up space in the customer-less store.Take a guess at why people are spending money at other places? 1) CHEAP prices and crappy service.  2) Overpriced stuff, but GREAT service.  3) Crappy, cheap stuff and crappy service.Sorry Barneys...you have WAY overpriced stuff and crappy service. You're not so special after all.~~#~0
Customer service was horrid.  Wrong food served.  Staff less than friendly.  Food mediocre.~~#~0
I had an insurance change which necessitated finding a new dentist  I had no teeth problems-just wanted a cleaning.I scheduled a 3:30pm appointment and showed up on time.   I got called out of the waiting room a little before 4pm.  The dental assistant Mike was very sweet and took my Xrays.  However...after the Xrays, no one touched by teeth until 5pm because the dentist was held up with a root canal.  When he finally came in, he gave me the 5 min visual oral exam and told me that one of my fillings should be touched up, so he recommended I return for a different appointment ON A DIFFERENT DAY to get my cleaning and filling touched up.  I asked couldn't both be done today? Dr.said "no" because they close at 5pm.  I couldn't even get the cleaning today? He guessed it was possible, but since I have to come back anyway for the filling, he stressed they'll just do both at a separate appointment.I thought about it, and decided I did not want to return:A) I'm over doctor offices that don't respect my time.  If you are running late, call me and reschedule or at least call me & let me know. I made an appointment for a cleaning that I had to take 2 hours off work, but you can't stay late to clean my teeth?B) I really didn't get the staffing arrangement. Really, NO ONE could clean my teeth in the hour I waited in the chair? A hygienist or something? You don't have to be the Doctor to do that. All I wanted was my teeth cleaned.  At a normal dentist appointment, the dentist sees you after someone else cleans your teeth.I asked the staff to just get me copies of my Xrays and I would bring them to another dentist and I wouldn't be returning.To the remainder of the staff's credit, they were very apologetic and got me the Xrays per my request.~~#~0
They are super expensive, No I mean ULTRA EXPENSIVE.They'll find an entire pecking list of things, that they'll suggest, you let them repair. I wouldn't go anywhere near, any of their multiple locations.If you enjoy. being played ... any of Greulich's many locations, will obligue you.~~#~0
OK, I know this is classified as a "dive bar" but the smell of vomit was so over powering last Sunday night that we walked in and walked right out.  My friend had the dry heaves all the way to the Saddle Ranch.~~#~0
This company is a joke to work with.  They missed their first appointment to come out an do an estimate.  When the estimator did come to our home the following week, he was very pleasant and provided us with an acceptable quote that was agreed upon.  The estimator gave us a time window of 9:00 am - 10:00am for the following weekend and told us that we would receive a call the following business day to confirm, which it was.Today, I placed a call to inquire the status of the arborist's arrival.  I was told that the crew wouldn't be available to arrive until 12:00pm or 1:00pm.  I was offered an additional 10% discount for the error in arrival which I agreed to.  At 1:30pm, I placed another call to inquire the status and was then told it would be another 45ish minutes.At this point, I asked to cancel the service and the phone rep proceeded to tell me that they never make time commitments and that it should have never happened.  While I can certainly understand that this may be his policy, commitments were in-fact made by his staff and they were not met.I don't think it's reasonable for any company to not give you a time window especially for a 6-7 hour job.  Even Cox and Qwest are able to give you a 4 hour window.I will also say the Owner, Al your tree pal, did give me a call personally to find out how to retain our business.  He stated that he has been working in the Valley for over 30 years and this isn't how he runs his business.  While I can respect that, his company and crew have now wasted my time and had lost my business.  I declined to reconsider my cancellation.There are too many other arborists' in town that I'm sure would be happy to take my money and provide me service in a timely fashion.I would recommend to anyone that you stay away from this business.~~#~0
I don't understand the attraction to this place. My daughter loves it but she's 11. I keep trying different things in the hope of discovering something edible. Last night I tried pasta and meatballs. The pasta was rubbery. Sauce and meatballs were Way too salty. I ended up asking for a 2nd dinner roll because that was the only edible thing. On the positive side, all of the staff are very nice and attentive.~~#~0
It is under new management.  The food is not quite as good as before.  The spring roll wrapper was dried and hard as if it was made a while ago.  The pho soup was too peppery, which is very unusual.~~#~0
We had a meeting scheduled for Capistrano's to supply our restaurant with bread and buns.  We waited over a half an hour before deciding we would need to reschedule.  Later, after we left, the gentleman we had a meeting with called us.   Instead of apologizing for wasting our time, he proceeded to blame us for being late when we were 5 minutes early!  After that failed, he tried to blame the receptionist who tried at least 3 times to call his office, twice on his cell phone, and even sent him and E-mail!  Apparently, Capistrano's has all the customers it needs and isn't really looking for more.  Take your business elsewhere.~~#~0
This is the worst UPS store I have ever been to. The gentleman in front of me only needed to buy one stamp and the employee asked him if he had cash or if he could buy anything else because it was costing him more to run his debit card than  he was making on a stamp sale. When it was my turn, I was shipping out a prepaid box. The rep asked me to buy my own tape to close the box, because he wasn't making any money on my shipment! Needless to say when you are providing a service to people, this is not the way you bring in business. I always ship with UPS but this has made me second guess my choice.~~#~0
OMG if you like Mexico without the beer then this is the place for you. It has 20 something checkout lanes and only ONE OPEN. What kind of sick bastard makes the checkout schedule in this place.~~#~0
Save your money, and drive a few more blocks to Filiberto's.  They are selling Filiberto's food at Outback Steakhouse prices.  The service is good though...~~#~0
DO NOT GET YOUR CAR SERVICED HERE! I came here for an oil change and tire rotation. The guy told me my cabin air filter was gone and he would replace it for half the cost. I ended up paying $100! I checked the reciept and there were so many extra charges on there it was ridiculous! I suppose I could of argued but the guys that work there are kind of scary.  I get all my service done at Camelback Toyota and they are always super nice and never try to rip me off even when I try to act dumb on purpose just to see if they will try to rip me off. I will never come back here!~~#~0
after my delicious first wrap, i went in here again and got the alota fajita with beef.it was disgusting. i had two bites and spit the second one out. the beef was gritty and seasoned weird. the green peppers and onions were stringy and not nicely textured.my salsa was watery and it had one huge tomato chunk it. the chips were STALE.wtf, mate?~~#~0
I can't review the food here because we never got seated! Knowing that Cheesecake Factory doesn't take reservations, my sister called Saturday afternoon to find out how long it would take a party of 14 to be seated that night. The hostess told her she'd take the name, asked my sister to call 20 minutes ahead to let her know we were on our way and our table would be ready shortly after we arrived, if not when we got there. Sounds perfect right? Not so much. We called them as requested and were told our table would be ready when we arrived. When we arrived about 15 minutes later, we were told they were running approximately 20 minutes behind. Not a huge deal, being Cheesecake Factory on a Saturday night. After 30 minutes, we asked again about being seated and were told that they were waiting for their large table to be vacated by a party who'd been there for 2 hours. Of course... who doesn't go to Cheesecake Factory for dinner at 4:00? Another twenty minutes goes by and again, we speak to the hostess station, who tells us the table just ordered dessert. At this point, it becomes pretty apparent we've been lied to. Finally after waiting for more than an hour and 15 minutes for a supposed reservation with two pregnant women, a diabetic and two antsy toddlers, we decided to leave. I have no problem with Cheesecake Factory not taking reservations. I think it's ridiculous, but it's publicized, so we dealt with it the best way we could. Had the hostess we'd spoken to earlier in the day not said it wouldn't be a problem, we would have made other arrangements for dinner that night.~~#~0
If possible, I would give A Perfect Sole zero stars...and I never even had a chance to visit the place! I purchased 3 certificates for a "relaxing express pedicure" from WeeklyPlus.com, one for myself and two as gifts. Since the purchase date, I have repeated attempted to call and schedule appointments, alternately leaving messages for Toni (the owner) or hearing that she was so busy but would call me back in "10 minutes". I've never received a call back and, when she did pick up the phone during my calls, she was pretty rude. One friend who received my gifted certificate was finally able to make an appointment after repeated calls, but has said that the woman she spoke to was rude and even a little scary. I'm ashamed that my gift has turned out so poorly and have even asked my friend to cancel her appointment and I'll give her a pedicure at a different salon.WeeklyPlus.com said they've received lots of negative feedback about A Perfect Sole and were willing to refund my account for the unused certificates. Also check out the guest book on the company's website for more comments about customers' poor service experiences.~~#~0
This is an old theater, or at least it feels quite old, that has very small screens due to the limited space provided by the mall space. I mean this is IN the mall, not next to it, like dead in the center. one of the theaters in there couldn't of had more than 25 seats, it felt like a living room. In the age of the CINE CAPRI theaters in Phoenix, there is no reason to go see a movie on a screen that isn't much larger than the one i have at home! you also have a ton of kids and teenagers from the mall who hardly care about the movie and just want to screw around and talk, ruining your movie. I love Harkins, but take a pass on this theater.~~#~0
Closed! big fat greek express now!~~#~0
BLUFGot it to go and glad I did. The chicken was OK but only for the first couple of bites.  The red velvet cake was aweful. BackgroundYelpers let me down on this one.  I ordered the three piece chicken meal expecting to stuff myself contented with fried goodness and slip into a glycosidic stupor from a criminally sized slab of red velvet cake.  Let me say I didn't have to watch the scale worried of well earned weight gain from this meal.  The chicken was an initial hit but was short lived.  I didn't finish it nor did I want to.  The waffle did not travel well either, it was soggy by arrival (10 mins to the hotel - arrgh!)  nor was it flavored in any manor. I would liken it to the generic bread slices used at other joints for sopping up the grease.  The red velvet was a crime.  It too lacked flavor, was heavy beyond understanding and it hurts me to say this - was only deserving of the trash. wa, wa, waaaa.$20+ for soul food that was so bad.~~#~0
Okay - we made it back to Dooby's for dinner on a Friday night after work. My memory of the food from Dooby's had me excited for a second try. Well, we walk in around 8 and the place is pretty full, but plenty of seating remained. The waitress told us to sit 'wherever' - we chose a spot near the window so not to be on display in the rather open seating area...I squinted at the beer taps and didn't see any of my old standbys, so when our waitress made her way over to the table I asked what was on tap. She rattled off a few, and I picked one. My girlfriend ordered a soda. My beer took FOREVER. Forever! This is a major pet peeve of mine - when I sit down, I want to start drinking, soon. I realize waiters/waitresses are often slammed - I've been in their shoes, so I try to cut them some slack. But this time, my waitress was only 15 feet from me and was flirting up a storm with a couple oafs at the bar. Serious, I was making evil-eye contact with her trying my best to emit my ESP rendering of  "BRING MY EPHIN BEER". Eye contact was continuously made with little regard for my parched state. Seriously, get me drinking and I am much more likely to forgive your crappy service!So, my beer arrives - and I swear to god the pint glass looked as if one of the oafs had taken a few fat gulps before it meandered its way to my table. Come on - several dollars for a pint, I want a pint dammit! The glass is 5/8ths full will not cut it! I'm not the type to complain at restaurants - again, I've been there, so I try to cut them slack, so I just took a deep breath and let it go. (While drafting my 'yelp the crap outta you!' rant in my head)I ordered the Gyro dinner and my sweetie had the falafel platter. I love gyros. We were given the option of soup or salad - I asked what the soup was. It was lentil, so I eagerly said soup! My answer was greeted with a vacuous stare from our waitress. I repeated soup.... To which I got a Bill and Ted's style "OOOoooooh". WTF.A few minutes later, she comes back and says "salad will be okay, right?". I love being told what will be okay - serenity now! The salad arrives, and it's a medley of minced lettuce, tomatoes, and other stuff. I hate tomatoes. If I can pick them out, its ok, but there were hundreds of little cubes in there. Gross - sorry. I wanted lentil soup after all...  Later when the waitress picked up my untouched salad I noted her lack of observation or care that I didn't touch it. At least pretend? So, our food finally comes, and I dig in. Meh. The gyros are pretty plain frankly, not bad but plain. There were some pita wedges and like seriously a teaspoon of humus. A TEASPOON!?!?! I like a teaspoon per bite! I'm done with Dooby's at this point - and then out of nowhere comes  "LA LA LA LA LA" Clank! Clank! Clank! A belly dancer comes running out clanging those shrill finger cymbals and the music begins to blast. Ugh. There goes the pleasant conversation! It was at least a warm atmosphere before - but now its loud and there is a large woman shaking and shrieking about the place. Soon the belly dancer makes her way to our table and starts wobbling her gut within inches of our plates. We try not to pay attention to her, just trying to eat here. She moves on, but within minutes, she's back and tells us "come on guys! Get up and dance!" Seriously, I'm eating; I'm not thrilled about being accosted by a freaking belly dancer in Mesa Arizona. This isn't Peter Piper Pizza Dooby, and it didn't seem the other patrons were really digging it either. My bill was $35 bucks - I'm not a cheap ass but seriously that's insane for what I got - remember, a teaspoon of humus. $10 and it might have been a good value.So, bottom line - I had terrible service, a sub-pint of beer, marginal gyros and a jello-belly gypsy all up in my face at Dooby's. Not impressed, and not going to be returning.~~#~0
I am a commuter from Seattle.. Meaning, this became my home away from home a few months ago. I stay here because many of my coworkers stay here... Lately this place has gone downhill quicker than a tumbleweed in a wind storm. The front desk acts like they are doing you a favor by checking you in.. Never a smile... Rarely a thank you.. Last month I stayed here 6 nites... The last time I had the opportunity to finally lodge a complaint. After all the card in the room totes 'Satisfaction Guaranteed'.. Joke! I had two roaches in my room.... One dead.. One live and fast. Uncatchable.. I called. I got a guy with zero energy in his blood. Kinda like that roach laying on his back dead? He said 'oh.. Well.. Ugh... Sorry.. Not my fault '... I told him about the rancid stained carpet.. The broken bent over lamps...'ok' was the response.. Calling the manager did nothing further.... This place is a dive... Know going in the 'satisfied customer'.. Won't exist here... Wifi.. That is gonna work about half the time..SO me and my buddy bidder..have found a new home away from home and away from this dive..~~#~0
One star not related to food, but business practice. As a warning to others, do not purchase a gift certificate to this restaurant through Restaurant.com, as we ate at the restaurant today, tried to redeem the gift certificate, and was told that they do not honor these gift certificates. However, they wrote down the certificate number and the validation phone number, which gave them all the information they needed to redeem it! As to the food, real mashed potatoes which are difficult to find today. They have broasted  chicken that is moist, crispy and tasty and I would give them 3 1/2 stars for food. This was our first time going and for the food I would probably go there again, but I will never go there again due to the business practice and rudeness. The gift certificate clearly states it is for this restaurant and they should have honored it.~~#~0
Yesterday was my third time in a few years to try Sushi Time. I've lived right by the place for a couple years now, and often opt for the sushi in Whole Foods over this place, but yesterday I figured maybe the third time would be the charm. The first time I had sushi from here, I had one of their specials. I was not impressed with the special even though it came at a good price. The Shrimp Tempura roll was okay but nothing to write home about. The miso soup seemed like it had just been made from the paste and did not include any sushi or wakame. The next time I went there was during a marathon study session at Starbucks with a friend. We got hungry and decided to try Sushi Time again. My friend ended up feeling extremely nauseated after eating and we had to end our study session early. He got a California roll and a Spicy Tuna Roll that time. I don't remember what I ordered. It must not have been horrible, but it certainly wasn't memorable.Sushi is probably one of my favorite foods and I love the fact that there is a sushi restaurant within walking distance from where I live. So I decided to try Sushi Time one last time yesterday afternoon. I was craving hamachi, but they don't have any at all. That's probably a sign I should have gone to Whole Foods - even they have yellowtail. I ended up ordering the Salmon Nigiri, a Spicy Tuna roll, and a Salmon Roll to go. I don't think they officially have a Salmon roll on the menu (just a Spicy Salmon roll), so I appreciate that they created one for me. However, when I got home and opened up the containers, everything smelled fishy. Raw fish should NEVER smell fishy.  I've had a stomach ache for the past 12 hours.I'm done with Sushi Time. I will take the extra time to drive to Sushi Eye on Warner and 48th, or perhaps I will find another sushi restaurant that is a little bit closer thanks to Yelp.~~#~0
Disgusting is the only word I can think of for this food.  Perfectly square orange colored deep fried fish that makes McDonalds fish filets seems like a gourmet meal!  The only thing resembling shrimp was the fact that they formed the fried "shrimp" into the proper shape.  After taking one bite of fish and one of shrimp I thought at least I have the french fries to eat.  They were nasty too!  I wasn't expecting anything fancy by any means, I came her because I wanted greasy fried fish and shrimp and the only part of that I got was grease.  I just don't understand the love for this place.~~#~0
I lived here for 15 months and it was living hell! I moved out weeks ago and I'm still dealing with their --------! First of all the office management is terrible! MINDY is not helpful what-so-ever, they will not give my deposit back because of fees she cannot even explain, they even wrote the wrong date when correcting my lease! I have to constantly call and I never received a call back. The apartment itself is cheap! My dishwasher broke, carpets are disgusting, cabinets falling off the ceiling, closet doors break....A neighbor of mine DIED and they did not recover him for almost a month and expected his neighbor to live there still with the smell of a decomposing body in his apartment, and never once reimbursed him for rent! Management simply wants your money and does not care one bit about your satisfaction. They are rude and unprofessional, & will create charges just to get your money. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE Read more: http://www.apartmentratings.com/rate/AZ-Phoenix-Colonnade-Gardens-Apartment-1423915.html#ixzz1sDuNXSCQ~~#~0
After reading the "wonderful" reviews we decided to go to Mimitas....and what a mistake!!!  We were, for the most part, the only two people in the so called cafe and had three different waitresses that could not answer our questions about the menu.  We ordered the pescado con ajo and that was a HUGE mistake.  The fish was covered with a layer of chopped garlic that we actually had to scoop to one side only to reveal a grey meat looking piece  of fish.  It just didn't look or taste right.  Their  Cuban rice was a couple of days old and out of a box and their sweet plantain was mushy and overcooked.  The waitress, kindly, took our hardly touched fish plate back to the kitchen and apologized for the food they had just served us.  We also got the all-to-sad-taste-the-same sampler.  The potato ball was dry and flavorless, the tostones were chewy, and the yuca and plantain just tasted like paper.  Since that day and for five days, we have been having stomach ache, cramps, and making all kind of "noises".  Obviously, we will not be going back.~~#~0
I have no business whatsoever being at a race track.  I know nothing about horse racing.  I was obligated to come for my friends birthday though otherwise I would never come here.  This place is dirty, out dated, and the crowd is dirty and dingy.  Never again!~~#~0
I have taken my dogs here for ever and loved the vets and staff. My dog suddenly became very sick on a Wednesday ,morning and I knew that the office opens at 7:30am. We got there early and waited. The receptionist opened the doors on time and I struggled to get my 100lb dog into the building. My dog collapsed on the floor barely breathing and she tells me that the vet will not be in for another 30 min!!!!! Why would you open a veterinary clinic without a vet present!? I had to have someone help me get her back into the car and by this time my dogs tongue was blue. We got to emergency and she died less then an hour later. Thanks Prestige for the help on one of the worst days of my life. I hope it was worth sleeping in...~~#~0
I joined a few weeks ago. Told the guy who signed me up I'd be playing racquetball and using the treadmill mainly. Sets me up. I pay fora year in advance. I call today and try to reserve a racquetball court. I'm told that I don't have the "amenity" of reserving a racquetball court on my membership. I can play all I want, but I can not reserve a court. Are you fucking kidding me? Who is the god damn brain surgeon who came up with this policy? Oh and how much is the racquetball court reserving amenity? Glad you asked. 180 fucking dollars annually! The whole year membership was about $450, which allows me to play racquetball. But, I have to pay $180 to "reserve" a court? What a joke~~#~0
We ate lunch here yesterday.  This location was filthy!  Food spilled all over the counter and on the floor.  It was hard not to step in it!  I had to ask if they had more chicken & pork (both of which were nearly empty and hadn't been refilled).  When we were seated the table in our booth was not wiped off and was sticky!  Gross!  We had to ask for water 3 times! Even though we saw at least 3 employees just standing around doing nothing!  C'mon people it's 112 degrees outside!! We're thirsty!!  The service was terrible and the whole dining experience at this location left a bad taste in our mouths!  We will not be back!!!!We have been to another location near P.V. Mall.  That location is always clean and service is very good.  If you like Genghis Grill Stir Fry...head over to that location!!!~~#~0
I use to find good stuff here now and again, but now this place seriously sucks. Prices are WAY to high, and the place is small.~~#~0
We called Precision and got a very reasonable quote on a repair, so we agreed to have them come out and fix our garage door. Our technician Chris arrived and explained to us that our door was falling apart and for a limited time only they had a special price of 4 times what we were quoted to fix the whole thing. I declined and said that I only wanted them to fix the broken spring. He then gave us the price which was almost double what we were told on the phone. I told him the price that we were given and he said that their employee must have made a mistake and he couldn't honor that, so I asked him to leave. Instead, he went through every sleazy sales trick in the book including calling all of his bosses to tell them about the crazy customer who wanted an unrealistic price. After that trick didn't work, he finally gave up and left. This is definitely the company to go with if you enjoy sleazy bait and switch tactics!~~#~0
Awful service the hostess was very rude and the prices are ridiculous for the quality of food. I would rather go to Streets of New York or Buffalo Wild wings.~~#~0
I've been to both the North Phoenix and Mesa location and the experience was about the same.  The service was lackluster, and there really wasn't that many customers in the restaurant.  The thing I found to be the worst was that the food I got was COLD!  One of my friends loves this place but I believe it's because of the salsa not the service or the atmosphere.  I recommend anything but this place for lunch or dinner.~~#~0
I ate there on 2/10/12 and got food poisoning,second time that I got poisoned at this establishment. I won't risk it again.~~#~0
Real Rating should be ZERO STARS, but it makes me put a minimum of one....No stars for the Tempe Library at 120 5th Street.  "Why not?!" you ask.  Well, I headed there today after reading the reviews and stood at 120 5th Street and noticed that it was home to the Courthouse and the Police Station.  A guard at the court house saw me looking at the building and motioned me in.  He asked, "What are you looking for?"  "The library," I replied.  To which he responded, "Oh, it just says there is a library here on the internet, there really isn't one."    Hmmm... "It just says there is a library here on the internet."  So, no stars for the library at this address because IT DOES NOT EXIST!!!!~~#~0
One star is really too much. We went to the one in north Phoenix (next to Red Robin) on a slow Monday night. It took forever to place our order, then over an hour to actually get the food. It definitely wasn't worth the wait. I'm pretty sure my shrimp wasn't cooked and the only veggies on the shrimp and veggie skewers were onions and barely-cooked zuccinni. The waitress wasn't even a bit apologetic for the wait or quality. I won't be going back.~~#~0
I used to live in Sacramento and would come home to visit family in Tempe.  At the time this was the only "chinese" restaurant (1990's).  My family would drag me here and I would be aghast at the small portions and steep prices (chow mein for $8-10?) and the portions were about 2/3rds the size of what I would get for $6.  Ignorance is bliss and when there's no competition, they can do this kind of stuff.Thankfully, there about 10 chinese restaurants within a 5 mile radius of this place and no one I know even comes near this place.So if it's high prices and diet-sized portions you're looking for, then have at it.What cracks me up is that the top 5 restaurants (according to many of the local chinese) are either not even on yelp or have only a few reviews.The best "yelpers" are the word-of-mouthers.  if it's good it spreads throughout the chinese community like wild fire.  And if it's bad, it spreads faster than a ladies sewing club....(i made that one up)I would recommend these places if you want the real deal (in no particular order)1) Asian Cafe Express2) New Hong Kong3) Tao Garden4) Asian Hong Kong Diner5) Great Wall6) China Kingjust ask the locals who grew up here~~#~0
Ugh!  I thought maybe I should try this place again before I slam it on Yelp, but after reading some of the other one- and two-star reviews, I realize I'm not nuts.  And there is no way I'm going to wait for hours to give this place another chance.  If you want to wait in line for two hours and then receive a cup of grease along with your hash browns and eggs, then Matt's is the place for you.  Disgusting!  Not to mention the bathroom is next door in a hotel room.~~#~0
From where I live in North Scottsdale , it's forty seven miles to this place, taking over an hour to get there.The line, like Disneyland's Pirates of the Caribbean.And by the time I got lunch, it was two o'clock.One star for my crew for talking me into this.I find a large table, underneath some very old and very beautiful tamarack trees. I don't like that I'm sharing a table, seated next to some fat kid with ice-cream sundae all over his mug who won't shut up. Then the ominous sign posted on the tamarack tree limb we were seated beneath, which is about five feet off the ground and growing perpendicular to it.    "WARNING: WATCH FOR FALLING SCORPIONS FROM TREE LIMBS"Another star and mega props to Joe's for not only having a farm and a restaurant, but an interactive poisonous insect exhibit as well.And finally, on the walk back to the car, we (as in my wife) noticed a plot of land across the street where you can rent a thirty by thirty plot for your very own garden.Another star for my wife now wanting me to plant a veggie garden next weekend.I'm hungover, driving for over an hour listening to Adele on repeat, (because we haven't heard 'Someone like you' one million times yet) standing in line wanting to puke, nervously watching for suicidal scorpions as I eat my burger and fries, listening to some brat I'd like to smack the bejesus out of, and my wife tells me I'm planting a garden next weekend.Yeah, no....I won't repeat.~~#~0
After seeing this place getting glowing reviews from the show "Check Please", I decided to try it.  And I am sorry I did...  After sitting down at the bar, I asked if they could turn the tv on above the bar.  The bartender explained they were all out of order - ok, bad start... So I sat down next to a couple loud yuppies at the bar - who were obviously trying to let everyone know they were extremely successful... It was not working, boneheads...  Decided to order the BLT burger, which looked good on the tv show review.  The burger arrived on a skewer, about 8 inches high a nice thick tomato, lettuce, and onion making it stand that verticle. For presentation purpose, it is kind of neat looking.  But when you try to eat it, it is another story...  There is NO WAY you can get your mouth around this burger to eat it.  They onion was not cooked enough, and was so thick, you could not even bite thru it - it pulled out when I tried and I had to re-assemble... The bun was cold - it could have used a little toasting to hold it together. It eventally fell apart again - even when I mashed it down.  I ordered the burger medium, and it came well done, NO pink - it was defintiely over cooked.  No juices at all.  The Grind advertise the ultra hot oven - and cooking it in butter on a cast iron skillet adds flavor.  BUT, I have to say, there was basically NO flavor what so ever in the hamburger meat.  It was very bland.   The bacon on the burger was nicely cooked and was tasty, but the patty was not.  It could have definitely used at least some salt and pepper.    And if there were any around (there was not), I would have used some.... The so called char from the broiler did not add any flavor - more like burned fat - yuck...   I was quite dissapointed.  I will not return.  The burger was $12, and included NO fries, that would be extra... So wih my corona and my tip, I spent about $20 total.  I would have been happier driving thru McDonalds!   I kid you not, try the double double ANIMAL STYLE at in-n-out - it is 100% tastier than this place.  The burger at coach & willies also blows this place away.  For a place that specializes in burgers, and advertises that they have won awards for them, I was expecting to be wow-ed.  Instead, I was very disappointed.~~#~0
The Costco of Italian restaurants.Terrible food and service.Listen, I get Italian family style dining. In fact I am a fan of it, especially being from NY. But what you serve I wouldn't feed my dog.Please leave. Thank you and good day.~~#~0
The experience was awful from beginning to end:1.  No greeter upon arrival.2.  Waited forever before order was taken.3.  Waitress was short (What do you want?)4.  Water glasses smelled like dirty dishwater.  When we told the waitress, she didn't even apologize.5.  Waited 10 minutes before complimentary appetizers (heirloom tomatoes and homemade mozzarella was not very impressive) were brought out to distract us from the wait.6.  A total of 30 min went by before our food came out.  7.  Grilled beef tenderloin was overcooked.  Medium rare came out medium well.  Couldn't get out fast enough.  Definitely overrated.~~#~0
I am usually pretty fair on my reviews but this company was AWFUL.Here was my experience:Called to schedule a cab ride to the airport 2 hours before I needed to leave. The operator, whom had a very difficult time understanding English , took down my information. Two hour came and went, no taxi in sight. Called the company, same operator as before, to have them tell me that they "ran our of taxis and cant pick us up". He was not apologetic, his response was "call Yellowcab" then gave me their number.  DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!!~~#~0
If you think this is a bar... DON'T! If you want to drink beers with friends, this is not the place! They cut us off after our 4th beer! In Tempe that is ridiculous! Don't waste your money here!~~#~0
This bar is what a Walmart plus a Benigan's (old school bankrupt TGI wannabe chain restaurant) version of a bar would be. The whole place has this strange odor... The food is all fried, oily or piled on with a bunch of different sauces and marinades... The drinks are cheap but you get what you paid for. Their wells is the $3 per bottle generic ghetto brand. So, their drink specials are not worth drinking since it will taste like watered crap. Check out the Maricopa Health Dept Restaurant Review website - this place has had major violations - ex) having outdated food in their fridge and brown slime mold around the soda nozzles at the bar. Disgusting.It's too bad that there is no cool lounge or bar in this area and this is the only bar that most locals like to go to. But hey... most people's expectations in life must not be very high if they frequent this place. Oh and I want to state one last thing: If you WORK at CK's you can't CHECK IN and become the DUKE. That's double dipping. It's pathetic that you want outside attention for just showing up for work.~~#~0
Terrible terrible terrible.~~#~0
I have been here one time, got a pair of shoes, my first ever Nike brand shoes. Their selection in wide shoes is very limited, but I was able to find one pair and I took them home. Service in the store was otherwise very good. The  place is very clean.Now, they are spamming my mail box with shoe fliers. What's worse is they contacted my bank and got my address without my permission, which is creepy stalking behavior. Very creepy.So if you go here and pay on plastic, be prepared to be stalked.~~#~0
Do not shop here!!  I had a terrible experience!  The shop is dark and dingy and the staff is disorganized and very, very rude!!  The owner was supposed to contact me by phone which she never did!!  I will never step foot into this store again!!  Ladies, do not waste your time by even considering this store.~~#~0
While the atmosphere is cute and cozy, the staff uber friendly and hospitable, the food was pretty terrible.I am vegetarian, and from what I could tell after a quick glance of the menu, there are only 2 veg options (a hot and a cold wrap), besides salads of course (didn't check how many).I got the cold wrap, I think it was called "farmers market fresh veggies" (or something like that) which has a variety of greens, a couple of grilled veggies, provolone cheese and a mayo pesto dressing... there is so much potential in it, but it was all lost on the totally watered-down dressing! I also got the side of "homemade pesto pasta salad" which, again, sounds fantastic, but was also a miss due to the, again, totally watered-down sauce... it felt like someone dipped the entire thing in water before serving it up.I hope they fix the sauce/dressing issues because I would love to go back, but for now, I'm definitely staying away.~~#~0
PLEASE BEWARE of this place.  I brought my dog here  (and, BTW, there is competition, GREAT competition and I'll get into that later).  And the "vet", the woman w/ the dark, curly hair, said my dog (Mmi) had a luxated lens, and had already (years earlier) diagnosed her w/ macular degeneration.  She said Mimi would need an $800 test to test her eye then a $3400 surgery, and said "why don't we just wait a while and remove the eye, she'll go blind from the degeneration anyway).  NO WAY.  I had already let this woman talk me into removing one of my other dog's eyes (he passed on later) and it was a horrible, traumatic surgery.  I am now picturing this vet as having rows of jars of dog eyeballs in her home.  She seems to get off on eyeball removal.  So we asked our HOLISTIC vet if she knows of an excellent eye doc. for Mimi.  She asked around, the answer was "Dr. Meredith in Tucson".  So, we made the appt. ,packed up our crew and headed down.  HE IS EXCELLENT.  He is very humble, and won't tell you this, but I found out he is one of the top, top, no. one docs in this field.  He is kind, caring, explains everything, funny, and about half the price for the visits.  PLUS, he SAVED Mimi's eye, and the surgery (a major one) cost a thousand bucks less than I was quoted at ripoff Gilbert.  That's right a thousand bucks less for a real expert.  Now, Mimi can see and is doing great instead of being eyeless.  On top of that when I mentioned her supposed macular degeneration he looked at me oddly and said "she doesn't have that, whatever made you think she has that.". So, the "eyeball plucker" was wrong or lying about that too.  If you don't think your dog is worth a two hour trip down to Tucson to see a real pro, who cares, I don't think you deserve your dog.  But, I will add again, you will save your dog from horrors, and save yourself some cash~~#~0
The food was pretty good, but there was a hair in my sandwich. I obviously couldn't finish, I was very disappointed!~~#~0
Stayed here once in 2006 and had roaches in the room.  Now in October of 2010 my husbands company had an incentive trip.  6 people so far have been hit with credit card fraud!  The highest victim got hit for a 1200.00 purchase on the same card used to check in.  Stay away or monitor your credit after staying here!!!!!!!~~#~0
I have been to  Boston's twice - once on a weekday afternoon, and a Friday during happy hour - and both times have I been grievously disappointed. I am not especially picky about my eateries; so long as they serve good food, the place can look as dumpy as is permissable for satisfactory health inspection. I am readily forgiving of flummoxed trainees, the occasional forgotten condiment, and the typical slowness of service during peak hours. I respect people in positions to cater to my incessant hunger and possible alcoholism, and I show this by accepting them for their occasional shortcomings.That being said: Boston's is not forgiven. The first time I came here upon the recommendation of a trusted friend, we experienced downright sluggish service. It was a Tuesday afternoon with nary a soul in the house save our two-person party, and our rough-looking server couldn't be bothered to take our order in a timely fashion. She argued with my friend and overcharged him for his beer, then refused to pay us any mind after our food had been delivered. Another, seemingly more pleasant server noticed we'd been biding our time drinkless, and fetched us our refills. We overheard a catty exchange between the two women as Server of the Year swept past, which told us right away that this lack of hospitality was not atypical of this potential ex-con that had taken our order.Flash forward to last Friday: despite having been underwhelmed by my maiden voyage to Boston's, I ventured in again - this time in a party of three - only to wait awkwardly in the entryway for an upward of five minutes until someone emerged to seat us. This 'someone' was exactly that - a seemingly random, untagged man who could just as easily have been the general manager as some drunk at the bar.  We were not given a choice of where to sit - a huge faux pas for any joint serious about its service. Instead, we were escorted into the bar/lounge area and instructed to sit at the awkward high table just around the corner from the bar. When asked if we could be relocated to a booth, we were refused the opportunity.At a spritely 5'2", I don't fare well in chairs that sit over half my height off the ground, and the space behind me was an uncomfortable flurry of movement to-and-from the kitchen. Even at our easily accessible, high-traffic location, we were not offered so much as a glass of water. We waited twenty minutes to be acknowledged in a near-empty bar well into the range of happy hour before abandoning our table and walking out. As an added insult, the entire exit was blocked by the man who'd seated us and a few identifiable employees. We brushed passed, effectively interrupting their conversation, and the guy - more than likely the actual manager as opposed to an inebriated managerial impersonator - said nonchalantly, "Oh hey guys, everything all right?""Yeah," I muttered as I followed my stoic companions outside. Apparently he had wax in his ears, because he poked his little head out after us and asked again, a bit sternly, "Guys? Everything all right?"I snapped, "Yes!" - the tone of which translated to: "No jackass, everything isn't all right!" But it wasn't worth arguing: we were parched, hungry, and too irate to be rational. I've heard great things about Boston's, but have yet to experience one. I can chalk up a few mistakes to human error and the nature of the restaurant industry, but the inattentiveness and general lack of hospitality demonstrated by the largely uncaring staff is too blatantly disrepectful to warrant a third shot.~~#~0
I am rating this a "one" because the service was so very bad! They weren't very crowded but it took forever to get our food, the waiter didn't apologize for the delays or anything. There were three of us, my husband ordered a basic turkey burger and it was so bad he couldn't even eat it the waiter saw that he didn't eat it and never asked if it was okay or anything. The other two meals were average the muffin was great!I wouldn't go back the that location, may try a different location to compare.~~#~0
These guys are terrible i dont recommend them. They take forever to do the work and the price is always more than what they tell you. Go somewhere else~~#~0
Worst Mexican food ever.  Would rather eat at Taco Bell.  There are so many better options in Arizona, I dont know why you would eat here.~~#~0
Absolutely the worst company to rent from. The AZ Regional Manager is rude and completely uncooperative. They just want your money and do not attempt to work with anybody. During our short stay at San Marcos, an Equity Residential community, we were bullied by the Property Manager. In February our garage flooded (because of rusty, neglected piping), and the Property Manager could not be contacted by myself, Scottsdale Fire Department, or the City of Scottsdale to shut off the water. After all of our things were destroyed, a San Marcos employee entered our garage, after it was agreed upon by management and myself that no one would enter or touch my property without my notification for insurance purposes. The employee did not only unlawfully enter the garage, but was touching my personal property. When he was confronted and told to leave, he retreated to the front office and called the police. The San Marcos employee attempted to file a false police report stating that he was physically harmed and was forcefully removed from the garage. No charges were filed because the peace officer could not find an evidence that the employee was harmed or telling the truth. This San Marcos employee entered the garage unlawfully, lied, and attempted to file a false police report. Throughout all of this the Property Manager and Equity Residential have been uncooperative, and demand $1300 to buyout of a lease that was violated by their own employee. My keepsakes and possessions have been ruined, the cops have been falsely involved, I have been continuously bullied by management, and now I am battling ridiculous fees and charges. DO NOT RENT FROM EQUITY RESIDENTIAL!~~#~0
Boo on you! I think Chipotle has just gone down hill. You know what Chipotle feels like to me? Pop culture...they coax you in with great deals, giving you as much food as you want, no complaints they have a "it's all about the customer" feel...they start to take over in popularity, everyone loves them, raves about them: they're healthy, they use organic ingredients, they are such big burritos!...but then a shift starts to take place...employees start to cut back on the good offers, not all stores, but some started to hesitate when you ask for more meat/beans, they bang the spoon a few more times to get just a little more beans or meat off....and then BAM! You're getting charged close to $2 extra for 4 more pieces of meat!! The extra charge for meat isn't even listed on the menu (but they do list the extra charge for their sucky guacamole). In short, they took a great idea, watered it down, inflated the prices, and made their bottom line more important than customer satisfaction. Piss on you Chipotle and everything like you.~~#~0
The owner is the rudest, most self-righteous and deceptive salesman I have ever encountered. My watch had its 1/10sec hand stuck. He first tried to replace my watch's movement with an incorrect version (not the same as mentioned on the back/inside of the watch) and then when I (very respectfully) pointed it out with user manual description of operation he just went completely unprofessional, sarcastic and down right disrespectful. He told me that he can not work on my watch and that I am wasting his time. I drove 30 miles to his shop because he had good reviews but boy did I get a rude awakening. Worst of all he did not even explain why he was unwilling to work on the watch, was it because I pointed his mistake (though in a very respectful manner)? was it that he wanted to push a wrong mechanical (movement) into my watch and felt embarrased when caught? was there any socio-religio-political motives behind this beligerance? guess I will never know. Getting a "you are wasting my time, sir" after being shown your mistake instead of being humble speaks volumes about ones take on business dealings. Customers beware...UPDATE: I took the watch to another local watch repair store (in Mesa, AZ), they checked the watch and told me that there was nothing wrong with the movement it was wrong size battery that had pushed the movement causing the 1/10th second hand to freeze. Well $10 later the watch was fixed compared to $50 asked for changing the movement and that too with an incorrect one. What a crook this guy is. Dishonest, incompetent and unprofessional...~~#~0
Not going back. I made an online web order and appointment with out the door price for $134 including all disposal fees taxes and installation. I sent my 17yo son in to get a tire replaced and upon completing the work they told him it would be $160+. Luckily I had told him how much it was going to be and he told them it was supposed to be $134 and the clerk quickly changed it back. Very shady...My son had a learning experience, trust no one and get a price up front.~~#~0
Aside from the normal hum drum mexican food you can get just about anywhere else, the decor was quite different and the outside seating was rather impressive. It definitely was not your average Mexican restaurant. The service on the other hand was atrocious. We had to walk all the way through the outside seating and into the main building of the restaurant in order to see a hostess who in turn told us to sit where ever. Wouldn't it have been easier if the hostess stand was by the entrance then? After we sat down we were immediately ushered to order by a flushed faced server. You could tell they were understaffed. We munched on chips and salsa for about 20 minutes before our food came to the table. Mind you, we got a chimichanga meal and something with chicken. It shouldn't have taken 20 minutes. The worst part I would have to say is that during the entire time we were eating, there were girls dressed in skimpy costumes parading in and out of the restaurant. My jaw, and about 50 others were dropped every time one of those girls walked past. After getting fed up with the lowsy service, mediocre food, and jaw dropping atmosphere we decided to leave. However we waited 30 minutes in order to pay our bill. Word to the wise: Stay away~~#~0
I am ordinarily a very laid back person.  However, when I walked in, there were at least a half-dozen people chilling behind the counter, and it still took at least 5 minutes for someone to help me.  I ordered a bagel and an iced americano. I waited nearly 10 minutes for my bagel, and when I asked about it, the guy picked up the bagel sitting on the counter and handed it to me.  It was cold.  To fix the problem, he re-toasted it.  So then it was burned.  Super.  Who doesn't love a burned bagel in the morning.Now let's talk about that "Unlimited Coffee".  Honestly, this stuff should be limited by federal mandate.  As in...don't drink it.  Even after four Splenda and a healthy dose of milk, it tasted like something died, they blended it up and poured it over ice for me.  I took one sip, gagged, made my brother experience the nastiness, and then logged into Yelp.  Now...if you're just coming for the "coffee shop atmosphere" don't do that either.  It looks like they gave a 13 year old a $500 budget at WalMart.  They have folding chairs to sit on and the sketchiest couches I've seen outside of GoodWill.  If zero stars was an option, I'd go with that.~~#~0
Went there with my family, placed an order for over $30.00. One of the girls wrote the wrong number on the sub and acted like it was my fault. Went back to the counter to buy something else and another girl at the counter acted like I was bothering her. Very bad customer service. I get treated a lot better at subway. Will never go there again.~~#~0
Yikes, the spot was soooo cute - and super close to my home. But the  SERVICE was horrible!  The food was good - but I assume it was the owners day to wait on tables?  She needs to stay in the back!  Wait, this place is super tiny...maybe there is not a back area! She rushed us to order.  Worse part was she tapped her finger on our check and said, "can we settled up?"  I guess she was in a hurry to count her "winnings" for the day? I have NEVER been treated in such a way before.  My associate said he had been there before and stated, I should have warned you, while the food is good, the service is really bad!  Yikes, I won't be back - unless the Southern Belle who served us disappears! The other staff (a cute guy who appeared to be a barista) was smiley and nice - wished he had waited on us!  Mind you, all the while we were being rushed, there was clearly no wait for our table!  As we parted - I looked back and notice all three staff people huddled around the cash drawer with there days tickets - people, get an office!  While, in this crazy business market - I get you need to make money, but while your place is open, focus on good customer service - and trust me, your business with thrive!~~#~0
I was seeking a place that I could go to strengthen my marriage and was given a referral. The classes are group sessions and of the 2 hour block that you attend there is about 20 mins of content.If you approach the instructor at the end of the class in a sincere matter you are quickly brushed off as the instructor seems to be trying to escape as if they know they place is about to be bombed.~~#~0
Never seem to have what I want. How do you run out of bagels at a bagel place? Always feel ignored when I go. Seems a little dirty behind the counter.~~#~0
I went to this office when I had a glass cut, with one hand up in the air to prevent the continuing bleeding.There were only three persons in the lobby, but I had to wait for an hour to just get in to waiting room. The nurse took me to the waiting room, she was so cold, no "hello" or "oh, what happened?" you know, the usual compassion greeting when you go to doctor's office. I was left in waiting room for 2 hours.Meanwhile, the doctor & the staffs chatting; laughing outside the waiting room.After the physician assistant finally gave me stitches, a big man came in with a poker face,no smile,no introduce himself; no eye contact and say absolutely nothing.  I had to ask him his name to break the coldness in that room 5 minutes into his jobto clean my wound. Something about this place is very wrong, either the company did not treat their employee right so they don't care the quality of their service. Or it just simply run by a group of people with no compassion, just extreme incompetence.I walked in there at 11am, out at 3pm. 4 hours for couple stitches.While I was driving home, with a headache from that bad air circulation room,I was still wondering how can a place like that still standing?I did not go back to this place to remove the stitches,i thought if it took 4 hours to take care of my bleeding wound. Imagine just for removing stitches, how long would they make me wait?Do yourself a big favor, research a better urgent care while you are healthy. You'll be happier to find a place that will treat you at least as good as you treat your dog.P.S.Another possible reason for others to have 5 star experience is that they'll let you cut in & treat you better if you pay cash or have better insurance.~~#~0
I stopped at the Ahwatukee store with my 14 year old daughter this past Sunday afternoon.  I am letting my bangs grow out and wanted to look for some cute hair clips.  She wanted some earrings, etc.Lots and lots of sparkly stuff.  Some very cheesy but some very nice.  I ended up spending over $60 in the store altogether, which included some mini hair clips with sparkly little butterflies for $11.99.The next day I went to use one of these clips and as I attempted to remove from the packaging and open, the crystals one the clip popped off.  There were six in the package so i tried the next.  It wouldn't even open.  All of the clips were defective.Tuesday, I went back to the store expecting to be able to exchange the item.  A very nice girl told me to look for something to exchange the item for.  As I looked through the rest of the hair jewelry, she came over by me and grabbed a bunch of similar clips from the shelf.  All of the similar clips.  Finally I chose some bobby pins and went to make the exchange.  She asked for my receipt and as I rummaged through my purse, she said that's ok.  Then she said "this isn't our product".  I asked so what are you saying - she said that it wasn't their product and there was nothing she could do for me.  I said well you sold it to me.  It's in your packaging, your shopping bag and your receipt.  She insisted that it wasn't their product and she talked to the owner and there was nothing she could do for me.  I said you're kidding me - this is a 12 dollar item - I don't need to switch a crappy product and try and scam you for 12 dollars.  I asked if she was okay that I would never return and tell everyone I know the crap they sell and the lack of customer service.  All she would say is there is nothing she could do for me.UNBELEIVABLE!Do not bother with the crap they sell.  Its poor poor quality and they will not stand behind anything.~~#~0
Eh. As I may have mentioned in previous reviews, for me, the bar for Thai food is set by Thai Hut. Erawan ain't even close.First off, the place is dank. Like they built it in the basement of some 1960's ranch house. The carpet is funky -- not like fun-KAY -- but like ew, funky.I do give them props for friendly and attentive service. But the food, is just OK. The fried apps are really greasy, and the accompanying sauces are so straight-out-of-the-jar.The entrees, not much better. The pad kee mao was really oily, and despite the "spicy" warning, was exceedingly tame, as if they dumbed it down for us. Plus the portion size was really small, and they skimped on the noodles. Oh, and they charge for soda refills. We just felt nickel and dimed for a skimpy, boring meal. Not like we expect huge Buca di Beppo like portions -- just enough so that you aren't starving 20 minutes later.~~#~0
I initially went to the Gordon Biersch in Tempe and was not impressed as their beers were flavorless.  However, my wife and I live within walking distance of this Gordon Biersch and a few months ago went there for a snack and a drink.  I can't recall what I had (it was a seasonal), but it actually tasted like a decent beer.  So, my opinion was beginning to change.  until a few weeks ago.My wife and I are from Indianapolis and we wanted to go somewhere to watch the Colts vs. Bills game.  We walked to GB, arriving at 11:30 a.m. (the game started at 11).  There were a total of 6 people in the restaurant taking up 2 separate tables, 1 inside and 1 outside.  None of the 6 people were remotely interested in any of the football games showing on the various tvs.  My wife and I sat at the outside bar and asked the bartender if she could switch a tv to the Colts game as it was not on any of the tvs.  She said someone had called in and requested the game showing on that tv.  (I think it was Cincy).  I asked if they could change a different tv, or put the Cincy game on another tv.  I also remarked that no-one was here, it was 11:30 and my wife and I were there and ready to spend money.  She said she had to ask the Manager.  The bartender returned - yes bartender - not the manager - and said, "the manager said we cannot change the channels since someone called in and requested the games."  I laughed and said, "well we are here, ready to spend money."  Keep in mind, there were multiple tvs - in the remote chance the Cincy fans arrived and wanted that game on that particulary tv, there were other tvs that were not being watched that could have accomodated us or the Cincy fans.  Again - only 6 people in the entire restaurant with multiple tvs - just none of them showing the Colts.  (and the hapless Cards were not playing until later in the day, at home)  The bartender was very professional, and annoyed at the manager's decision, but said there was nothing she could do.  So we left.  I thought it was poor management that the manager refused to change the channel and also did not have the courage to come tell us.Interesting note, we called BJ's and asked if they had the Colts game on.  They said "no, but we will put it on any channel you want."  Guess who we gave our business to?  I think we spent about $50, not counting tip.~~#~0
Very minimal selection. Small seating area. Not many bikes either - mainly Felt. If you want coffee go to a real coffeehouse. If you want bikes go to a bike house.~~#~0
The food was over priced and tasted like something you would get in a junior high cafeteria. The meat had no taste the salsa was blah. The decor was way to bright and over the top. I will never go back and have told plenty of my friends not to try this place, save your money and go somewhere else.~~#~0
Ummmm......one of the worst burgers I've had in quite some time.   Hey, if you like salty buttery oily burgers then this is for you.   I'll stick with fudruckers, blu burger, red robin or any fast food joint....hehe!    Want to try a great burger go to Firebirds.~~#~0
Consistently disappointed with this Starbucks.My coffee has been made wrong on more than one occasion. Additionally, my spinach feta wrap has been cold in the middle now 3 times. Who likes to bite into a cold egg in the middle of a supposedly warm spinach wrap?YUCK!The drive thru is always chaotic with at least a line of 7-10 cars wrapped around the parking lot. Additionally, if you walk up to the window for the outdoor seating they are not any faster. Your order is still in line with the drive thru cars.I'll find another location to start my day.~~#~0
We went at 5:00 on a Sunday and we were the only ones in there.  It took at least 5 min to get chips.  DIRTIEST bathroom at any Baja I have ever seen!  A woman came in BAREFOOT and they served her.  Their highchairs are covered in old food.  The black and white checked floor was black and brown... filthy.  Will go to a different Baja location from now on.  Unacceptable.~~#~0
WORST experience EVER with a restaurant operator! The restaurant industry has been built on passion, love, dedication and perseverance. If you want to ruin a wonderful dinning experience this is your place.~~#~0
This place is terrible.  Utterly disgusting.  I had their trademark Blue Burrito and nothing about it was good.  All I wanted was one last good burrito  before leaving Arizona, and I should have eaten at the BK nearby. Yes, it was that bad.  STAY AWAY!~~#~0
If the fact that they closed at Biltmore doesn't say something.....I'd rather stab myself in the hand w/ a fork than eat there! Ugh!!~~#~0
Where to start? It's rare for me to ever award 1 star but Marcella's is truly deserving. We walked into an empty welcome, were then guided to our table by a hostess who scolded for almost sitting at the wrong empty table. It only gets worse from here.  After waiting about 7 minutes to be greeted we finally ordered a salad with dressing on the side.  After another 15 or so minutes our salad that was drenched in dressing was brought to the table (no pepper offered).  We then placed our entree order.  We each ordered a different pasta and were equally disappointed in the not only the presentation but also the flavor.  To continue with the trend of food taking way to long to arrive our entrees came out 40 minutes after it was placed.  If it was busy, I would understand that it takes time for a decent kitchen to produce quality food.  Since we were 1 of 4 tables in the giant dining room, there was no excuse. When my pasta "make your own penne tossed with garlic oil, add sausage, peppers and onions (which came out raw!!!)and a dollop of ricotta" finally made its appearance, it was cold. I let the server (Tyler who may need a lesson in customer service) know my pasta was cold.  He stood there speechless until the awkward silence was over. I said I would eat it the way it was because I was close to eating my arm off after waiting almost an hour for my dinner. My dining companion was equally as unsatisfied but I will not go into detail. Then the bill came, not once but TWICE Tyler said, "Can I interest you in dessert this afternoon?" It was 9pm.  Thanks Tyler.Just to add in a couple extras for your reading pleasure:*Water glasses are tiny and refill service is slow, so if you're thirsty, bring your own water!*Male was served before female in every course.*No manager came over after complaining about dressing on salad and cold pasta.Overall, probably one of the worst experiences I've ever had dining out.~~#~0
They serve Pepsi.  Got horribly sick about 30 minutes after I finished my meal.~~#~0
This place is no longer in business. Sad to see it go.~~#~0
A friend and I decided to try Wallys because they were having a prime rib special. The internet and menu stated the special was available after 4PM. We arrived at 4:15. The waiter said that it would be an hour before the prime rib was ready. We asked to speak with the owner. He came over and we explained that we came beause of the special and it would not be ready for another hour. He started screaming at us and told us to leave. He said 4PM was a typo on the internet and also on his menu. He told us to leave his restaurant and never come back. We were so scared that he would get violent. He definately has a mental condition.~~#~0
Man what a mess! I found myself walking in circles trying to figure out where to start and where to end. Everything is out of order and the placement of new releases (movies and music) makes absolutely no sense. This store could use a training day in merchandising. The staff seem disengaged and not familiar with the product. Want to throw the staff for a loop, ask for a copy of LA VIE EN ROSE...had to repeat the title several times to two different people who could not figure out what I was asking for. Oh forget it! Sincerely,  Empty Handed~~#~0
Went to this joint for a cold Tihaar, was blown away by the jackwagons that hang out here. Never in my life have I seen a more wretched hive of scum and villainy (for real). Employees were pushy, patrons were either criminals or d-bags bragging about their whips (don't care how many parsecks you made the Kessel Run in, bro), and the band that was playing must have been smoking deathsticks because they just looped their same cover song over and over again. Save your credits. This place is whack.~~#~0
I ordered biz cards from here thinking the total was going to be $140.  When I was called to be asked for approval for a $40 art fee, thought I should double check with them again what my total would be.  They told me $240.  I cancelled the order.  I ordered some simple 1/4 page cards to be cut by them for $2.00 cut fee and .25¢ per page copy @ 50 copies.  when I went to pick up the order I was expecting to pay about $15 total.  They told me I owed them $40.  I will never set foot in this OfficeMax again.  I thought I would get service like I got in the Minneapolis OfficeMax which was always great.  What rude experience this has been for me in Scottsdale.~~#~0
Pizza was disgusting.~~#~0
My expirience was not very great... It seemed liek a cool new place for young people to come and hang out. But the service and lack of respect i saw and recieved was horrible.  i went there once with my friend. the waitress who sat us, i belive her name was ashley? i think. but anyways, she was very slow at getting our drink order waited for some time for that. Then we ordered alcoholic drinks, she couldnt even make them herself and the woman at the bar, i did not catch her name but she was very slow, and not very good. It didnt look as if she knew what she was doing. Also there was a man at the bar drinking and she didnt much interact with him. Not a smile or anything. She seemed very rude. The asian man that worked there seemed a little rude as well. He was in everyones business and seemed not to care. I mean while some people were enjoying their meals, he was over sitting with them and talking but they seemed a little annoyed. But for the most part the food was good. I wished the drink was a little stronger but the service i cannot except.  They all seemed mediocre. I was not impressed. will not be going back and i dont recommend it to anyone.~~#~0
We went yesterday and were not impressed. I hadn't seen HSP's review, but would pretty much agree. I'm actually a bit upset that I can't give the place zero stars, because when someone walks away from breakfast hungry because the food was inedible, I don't think the place deserves even one star.I don't think that anybody mentioned this yet, but this is NOT a full service restaurant. One walks in, stands in line and orders at a counter. The menu is painted on the wall behind the soda machine. This is not necessarily a deal killer, but based on the previous Yelp reviews I had expected a sit down and be served kinda place (What can I say? I'm lazy on weekend mornings...)I ordered the pancake breakfast ( "2 pancakes, two eggs and choice of applewood bacon, sausage, ham or turkey" - I got mine with bacon and oatmeal pancakes for $6.99), and my companion ordered the egg white omelet ("egg white filled with roasted turkey topped with  tomato-avocado salsa w/ 9 grain toast and rosemary potatoes" - $6.99).  Croque Madame ("ham, tomato and melted gruyere on sour dough w/ sunny side egg, side of rosemary potato" -  there's mustard on it too, and it was $7.29) is a favorite breakfast treat of my companion, so we decided to order one and share it. We also asked for coffee and water.We were handed ceramic mugs for the coffee, but styrofoam cups for the water. The coffee was in urns on a side table near the register with a self-serve soda machine. The only source of water was the 'water' button on the soda machine. The coffee was ok, nothing particularly bad or good of note. The water from the machine smelled like dead fish and was undrinkable.Breakfast arrived on ceramic plates, but guests must retrieve their own plastic utensils and napkins from the counter. This I don't really understand... If they're going to have to wash the plates and coffee mugs anyway, why not give me real silverware and a water glass???Everything was lukewarm at best when it arrived. I went straight for the eggs while they were at least a bit warm as I'm not a fan of cold eggs. I had ordered them over easy, and they were either over-cooked or had continued to cook on the plate while it was obviously waiting to be delivered. I also had my half of the Croque Madam, which probably could have been tasty had it not been delivered cold. The pancakes were a bit chewy and rubbery but edible. The "applewood bacon" was indistinguishable from bottom shelf, cheap grocery store bacon - thin sliced, soggy, greasy, and cold.The biggest disappointment was my companion's egg white omelet. It was egg whites folded around sliced turkey sandwich meat. It was slightly undercooked, so the interior was turkey covered in uncooked egg white. The "tomato-avocado salsa" consisted of 3 cherry tomatoes sliced in half and about 6, 1/4" cubes of avacado dropped on top of the omelet, there was nothing "salsa" about it. My companion took one bite of the omelet, grimaced, shivered, and didn't touch it again. The omelet and croque madame were served with fried potatoes which were almost completely without color from cooking. Some were cooked through, and some were raw potato in the middle. I can't confirm it, but the lack of color and inconsistent doneness made me suspect that a microwave was involved.The best that my companion could say was "The toast isn't bad", which is good, because that's all she ate.Nothing about my experience at Kafe 440 would give me even the slightest inclination to return. The $2.99 breakfast at the Ikea down the street is far superior in quality and value.~~#~0
Arrogant, impersonal, administration......They are sure, not what they claim to be : A "caring"  school that believes in individuality... All they care about is to raise money and shine in public through their great students that are handpicked, and come together in that school for the Arts..  If your student is loud and had a sharp elbow and can push herself to the front rows,  or you can afford to go to all their fund raising events and be heavily involved, you sure will get the benefits  and all the attention...,.. The only good thing I can say about that school is the great liberal, open minded hand selected students that find their way to that school, .. because of the name of the school....and a few great teachers that have  already left.. There are still a few good ones left, like every other school....But the head of school & principal & vice principal are so busy with raising money and advertise for themselves that don't care about individual students....~~#~0
Closed.....out of business.~~#~0
I used to like blue wasabi.Admittedly, I liked other sushi places better.  Blue wasabi was more of a drinking place with decent sushi, and I don't mean decent like not indecent--I mean decent like eh, it was decent.this place has the acoustics of a mess hall.  annoying. but what really annoyed me was this:one time I was there with wife and in-laws, and because I have a ridiculously sensitive palate (at least when it comes to salt) I noticed right away that there was some foul shit happening with the soy sauce.  By foul shit, I mean that they were serving the low sodium version.  *pauses for ensuing outrage*Now they serve their soy sauce in little innocuous looking devices that don't come with the courtesy of a green or red lid.  What this means is that innocent people were unwittingly eating low sodium soy sauce.  Which is punishable by law, or divine retribution when "kingdom" finally "comes."  anyway....So I ask for the manager, and say: "is this low sodium soy sauce?" And he says: "Yes."  And I say: "Can I please have some *real* soy sauce?" And he says: "we don't serve anything but low sodium soy sauce."One fucking star, and be glad you got even that.  You should be embarrassed.~~#~0
Disappointing. Not authentic. We tried the Dragon Druken Noodles and Yellow Curry Chicken. The Dragon Druken Noodles was extremely sweet and the potatoes in Yellow Curry Chicken were huge and uncooked in the middle.~~#~0
I am not even to close fan of this place. I read the reviews and was super excited to try something new. This place was super super loud. The music was so load that people were practically yelling to hear eachother. I didn't feel like I could even talk to my partner while here. I did get seated pretty fast. I ordered the deviled egg dip that was so over salted, I had to send it back. We also order the cheese fondue that is what made me give this place some stars. As the main dish, I ordered the Windsor Burger that was just okay. Nothing really to get excited about. It wasn't and isn't something to even remember.Definitely not coming back or suggesting this place to any friends.~~#~0
The renters in my rental home complained of the dryer needing 2 cycles to dry their clothes. I called out Arizona Air Duct to clean the vent. Well, $75 later the issue is not fixed. I had another company come out. They pulled out a section of the vent to show me- there's maybe half the piping still coated in lint. (I wish i could post pictures here...)They refused to refund my money, so I'll be filing a small claims suit. AVOID these scammers. I'm not sure what 'work' they even did!~~#~0
This review is about the management of Binkleys, not the food as I never got to use the $200 prepaid voucher I had for the establishment.Having received a $200 voucher for my birthday I tried on several occasions to use it, I have two small kids and I travel a lot. On the three occasions I tried to use it they had not reservations available. One one occasion I had a reservation but had to cancel as I was sick (being fair)I finally got a reservation and the manager called me and in a very abrupt way informed me my voucher was worthless as it had expired. Upon review the term EXP with a date is apparently the expiry date.Given they had had the benefit of our money for over a year I thought they may be interested in honoring the voucher. NO I was informed and the neo fascist manager began to unload on me and chastise me for not being organized enough to use it.I am pretty reasonable and it it were my place I would accommodate customers, more so if a person who prepaid, it would make sense you accommodate them with a reservation, however Binkleys stance is "we have your cash now, let's fill the place with people who are yet to pay and the idiots who prepay can wait till last"This place may have great food but great management with a ficus on service and customers ...... NO WAY.Mr Binkley or what ever your name is you Bilked me out of my birthday present, thank you.I can only hope $200 worth of misfortune follows you.~~#~0
WHAT. THE. HECK?! This place has gone to CRAP since new mngt.  EVERYTHING has gone down hill.  They fired all the long-standing bartenders & servers (the ones who knew what they were doing).  The last time we went they served our food with PLASTIC forks, paper napkins and PLASTIC plates?!  (surprised our martinis didn't come in sippy cups?!?)  Will NOT be back, ESP. since the FABBY new ANGEL's & OUTLAWS just opened around the corner - guess who opened it?  The management who kept Devil's running smoothly for 5 years !!  (and the bartenders joined them :-)~~#~0
I love PPP but this location SUCKS. Avoid it. If you like their pizza as much as I do then go to the one on Williams Field and Lindsay (I think) as it's much better. This location for some reason has been off everytime. I had given them 4 chances but after the 4th and the taste being the same. That was it. No more.~~#~0
Do not use them!  These guys are not a legitimate locksmith company.  They have a BBB rating of F for a good reason.  Google "locksmith scam" and you will find this company satisfies every characteristic of a locksmith scam.  They answer the phone with "locksmith" not the name of their company.  They quote a low price over the phone then jack it up when they show up.  They don't show up in a company vehicle.  They want you to pay in cash.I was charged almost $200 for a home lockout.  After I paid, I felt uncomfortable paying that so I did some Googling and found references to locksmith scams.  I found a few local locksmith companies that have A ratings with the BBB and called them.  I was told the work should have cost $70-$80.~~#~0

*Okay, this is strictly based on their "10,000 egg" Easter Egg Hunt event this morning.* IT WAS TERRIBLE. We got there right at 9am so in time for breakfast, (which was $5 per adult, $3 per kid) so we got in line to buy tickets for breakfast. Then after standing in line and getting tickets, we had to go stand in another line to redeem the tickets and get food. When we bought the tickets for breakfast we also bought a $5 ticket for the Easter egg hunt for our little girl. Breakfast was not good but not the worst I've ever paid for. Onward to the petting zoo, cute and lots of friendly animals for the most part. Though I did see a little one nearly get mowed down (good reflexes mom!) by a pygmy goat with horns and an attitude. Otherwise, nice enough and admission was free today. Now, the big event was the supposed Easter Egg Hunt starting at 10am. We went to the 5 years old and under area since our little girl is only 19 months old. Got there at 9:55 so it was a little crowded but we ended up in the middle of the group. Well the hunt didn't start until 10:15am and by then we were packed like sardines in a can. So 20 minutes in the sun and dirt surrounded by babies all the way up to 5 year olds. Not a good plan. Right before they started they tried to shout out rules but the only one we heard was 1 parent per kid. When they took down the little fence EVERYONE rushed forward, I tried to get my little girl in to get a few eggs but I'm not that big and some parents were very zealous in "helping". Like the man whose kids were off collecting eggs and he was helping himself to as many as he could carry. WOW, leave some behind please? In the end I spotted one lone purple egg and told her to get the "ball", only to have to pry it from her and take the ant covered mint inside from her. Yes, MINTS as candy for an under 5 y.o crowd? Seriously?? In Marley's Farm defense, they did give us a refund for the hunt and apologized profusely. Still...it was poorly organized. Some suggestions for next year:-Break up the age groups. Instead of 5 and under, there should've been a 3 and under group. A 1 year old has a chance against a 3 year old but not a 5 year old. -Make SURE the parents are staying out of the actual hunt. They should only supervise, not help themselves to the eggs too. -Get some megaphones or even a karaoke machine and microphone so people can hear directions. Oh yeah, GIVE directions so people aren't standing in line for breakfast only to find out that they are in the wrong line and have to start over in another long line.~~#~0
The food is mediocre, the crowd too old, it is expensive even in happy hr and the servers are rude. The new manager even worse. I recommend Kyoto Japanese Restaurant at Stetson Dr in Scottadale for the best teppan ($20), sushi and drinks~~#~0
bad experience here about a year ago and felt very uncomfortable and pressured to spend money.  After I was told that I needed $10k in dental work from SPD, I Immediately found a second opinion who confirmed that I had very minimal problems to the tune of $150 after insurance.  . . hmmmmm. . .~~#~0
I went to Dr Maebin because dr. Brown was on a leave of absence. After some research online decided not to ever go back. Dr. Marvin was very nice and seemed knowledgeable but didn't trust someone that would work with Dr Brown. Do your research!!~~#~0
Yuck!  Why did I do this to myself?  I was running a few errands on Christmas eve afternoon and I decided to grab a sandwich for lunch.  I could tell these poor bastards running the place didn't want to be there but I wasn't making it hard on them, I just wanted a vegetarian sub.  The bread was old and smushed (resembling a slice of plain white bread) the toppings were unimaginative and sparce and the cheese was overly processed into something resembling Velveta.If you want a sandwhich, don't waste your time here... Einstein's, Quizno's, even Subway could do better.~~#~0
Service was not good, they forgot about us after our dinner was served. Chips tasted stale.~~#~0
One star, and that's one too many.Flew once, will never make that mistake again. Rescheduled a return flight home ( was told it would be no problem ) was given confirmation number and everything... showed at airport and was told they had no flight for me. Had I known I would have taken the original flight home. Had to purchase a last minute additional ticket at inflated rate.... no compensation due to their error. No customer service within their so-called "customer service"I learned my lesson...Stick with and only fly Southwest!!!!!~~#~0
I thought I would have a chill evening with the boys. We have been waiting what feels like forever for this place to open! So we were so excited. Hubby's out o'town and we came up here. There was a crush so we decided to place a to-go order. As I was standing, ready and waiting to place my order, they fielded calls from people and took phone orders right in front of me. I could have called from my cell phone while standing there and been ahead of myself? So I end up placing my order and  I left and came back after 40 minutes (couldn't keep my kids calm in there that long) and they don't have my order. Poof. It had disappeared. An employee kept asking me for my phone number even after I told them I  had ordered it in person. I actually had to tell her to stop and listen to what I was saying. Finally the manger comes over and I came up with my receipt. The manager looks at it and keeps saying, "He rang it up wrong. This says delivery." (The person who helped me was female, so I have no idea who he is talking about.) Then the employee who took my order came over as the manager is about to hand me 2 salads. He read the receipt number incorrectly, she informs him I ordered a pizza. Then after a few clicks on the register he said to me, "I put your money back on your card." And he walks off. This paragon of communication says nothing else so I assume it was a dismissal and I head for the door. I had 3 hungry, tired boys and, apparently, I needed to go find food elsewhere. At this point it had been over an hour. I was trying to navigate the stroller out the door as the gal who took my order chased me out and promised to deliver it for free. I was afraid it would taste like sawdust just because I was so angry. Fast forward another half an hour...We get our pizza and I was trying to be objective. It was doughy because it was undercooked and the bottom was positively coated with corn meal so in turn it coated my tongue every time I took a bite. And looking at my bank account today, I see that the expansive loquacious manager did NOT reverse the charge. So I paid to wait almost 2 hours, listen to my kids whine, drive there twice, be ignored by employees, disrespected by  management only to finally be disappointed by the corn meal pizza. The garrulous manager probably refunded those people their salads. I hope they were better than my pizza. :(~~#~0
I got a baja burrito and tortilla was overdone and the steak was cold. Girl behind the counter was very nice, but not real bright.  I asked her what time they closed and she had no clue.  I think she was too busy flirting with the cook to really give a sh__.~~#~0
I have had it with this gym.  I should have known better but I was pressured into buying a training membership at a ridiculous monthly charge which of course they hit your credit card.  In September of this year I attempted to get them to cancel this training membership because of financial difficulties.  I was told they would take care of it and I would be put on hold with my training charges and they would only charge me $15 a month until I could resume.  So of course the next month they hit my card again and I complained.  It took them 2 weeks to credit me back and then within 4 days they charged my card again.  I complained on 11/12/12 and am still waiting for the refund.  On 11/27/12 I called AGAIN and was told he would "call me back" in an hour...of course no call.  Today I called and asked for the gym manager.  We will see what happens but I WILL NEVER AGAIN USE THIS GYM.  This has been a source of frustration and stress for me for 2 months now.  Don't have anything great to say about the training when I was receiving it either...nothing bad just nothing great either.~~#~0
Bland, boring and old!  This food has nothing to do with Cajun or Creole, they would be out of business if they served this food in Louisiana.Get new recipes and better cooks.~~#~0
I gave them 2 stars initially, as Brian their main finance guy worked with me to get me what I thought was a fair deal, so I gave them an extra star. They put a GPS tracking device on my car - which failed, like a week later, and left me stranded 17 miles from home. I had to wait 3 hours for a tow truck out in Mesa. (The device also allows your car to start - acting, so they say, like a theft-deterrent device. Well, I couldn't steal my own car home that night, which was a ROYAL pain in the ass.) Also, their finance department told me they have auto-withdraw (so I wouldn't risk an overdue payment) but it turns out they don't have it set up yet. It was a major reason I did the deal. Big thumbs down for that, and the fact that they charge $4.00 for any credit/debit card transactions. I've never, ever heard of anyone charging to charge you (especially for a debit card). What a racket.Everything down the line with this place has been a snafu. Their in-house finance department, CAG, is rude and unhelpful. Avoid financing with them at all costs. This place reinforces the idea in my head that car sales is a big racket, designed to squeeze buyers for all they can, letting good customer relations slide on by as they get busy counting the money, and "selling the loans" to quote their own rep. (Note to everyone: Check all online reviews first before you buy a car, to get the REAL story...)Happy motoring, everybody!~~#~0
I'm going to echo pretty much what everyone else has said. The employees all seemed to have an attitude. Maybe it's a Philly thing and it's a part of their theme...?  The place is nice, however, half of the tables needed to be cleaned/wiped down from the last customer and it wasn't busy so... what's the excuse?The food however was awful. I had the wings as did my wife and they were cold and tasted like the kind you buy in the frozen food section at your local supermarket and then heat up in the microwave... At least they would have been hot if I had done it that way. My son had a slice of cheese pizza which was absolutely gross. It looked like it had been sitting for a day and had zero flavor whatsoever in addition to being like cardboard.Avoid.~~#~0
I initially negotiated with their Internet Sale rep. and we both know and agree the invoice price WITH DESTINATION for my interested 2007 Acura TL is $31817.93 (yes down to the penny). We talked (email and phone) and I agreed to come in to purchase it around invoice price. Good Deal right? Well big mistake! I talked to a sale guy and said I am willing to buy the car around the invoice price + fees. Surprisingly they agree to sell the car exactly at $31817.93. I know it's September and '08 models are here in their lot already. I was still surprised but thought maybe they are willing to sell 07 inventory at invoice price now. But when they bring back the numbers with the sale price and fees, they included the DESTINATION CHARGE ($670) AGAIN, mixed in with Title and registration, Tax, Documentation fee ($369), etc.. I was there for like 4 hours and it was after 10pm, I didn't remember that the $31817.93 included the destination charge. So I agreed and purchased the car.The next morning when I looked at their number again and realized they charged me twice for the Destination fee, I am not happy with this tactic. See, if they told me that they need to make a profit for $670 on top of the invoice price, and if I agreed on it, then I CAN live with that. I made that choice, right?!  But this is not. This is on one side they said to sell you the car for invoice price, on the other side they pull out this trick to embed the same Destination charge again among the fees to make up the profit. That is just wrong and dishonest, completely disrespectful to buyers. If I am fooled, I am sure there are plenty buyers out there that suffered the same thing, except they probably don't know it! What make this situation worse is, I went back to the dealer ship to talk to the sale manager, Andy. He basically said that's the price I signed to purchase and there is nothing he can do. After a couple rounds of fruitless discussion, I talked to the branch manager, Joe Leavitt. Wow, what an experience! He basically said the same thing but with a more arrogant, 'you-are-a-sucker' style. He tried to imtimidate me by asking how old I am, then said to the effect of 'Hey, you are over 18. You made the decision and now deal with it!' If the man in charge has that kind of integrity (or lack of), imagine how that influence the rest of the sales managers and sales associates. In this dealership, it doesn't matter whether a business practice is right or wrong, clean or dirty. As long as they can make a profit out of a buyer, they will find a way to get you signed the paper. This is what I learned from them, stright from the leadership. Yes I mean you, Mr. Leavitt. Thought I want to share this with you the $670 lesson I learned from this dealership. I am not getting anything back from them, and I don't mind spending another hour summarizing this for you. At least you can be smarter!~~#~0
I wish I hadn't wasted my time to drive all the way out to this factory.  When I pulled up I couldn't tell if it was open as the parking lot was empty (should have been my first clue).  It was about 2p on a Thursday and the factory part was done for the day I guess as no one was working.  No free samples just a decades old video going.  No employee greeted me or even noticed I was there.  BIG WASTE OF TIME!~~#~0
So let me start off with saying I REALLY wanted to like this place,. Back home there was a killer Chinese Buffet by my house so I was looking for a replacement, plus its right across the street, and had really good reviews so I had to check it out. We went around 5:30 on a Wednesday..when we went in only a few other people were there our waitress came over and took our drink orders and off we went to get food. The first thing I ate was an egg roll which was pretty yummy, then I ate a small crab rangoon which was cold. Then when I went to eat my Orange chicken I noticed there was a black hair stuck in the chicken under the breading. Ew. I told our waitress and she apologized profusely, but by that time I had already lost my appetite. My boyfriend wasn't really impressed with his either (most of the food was barely lukewarm) but 'I told him we might as well try the sushi before we leave. At the sushi station you order your sushi and they make it fresh. There was a sign that said, "Brown rice upon request", so I asked for a spicy tuna roll with brown rice. The guy making the sushi responded with, "Maybe we don't have brown rice", avoiding eye contact with me. Awesome. So after that we told the waitress we wanted the check  and she could tell we weren't pleased. Since I had only eaten an egg roll and one of their little crab rangoons I asked to have my bill either discounted or to not get charged for my meal. The waitress said she would talk to the manager. They didn't charge me for my meal which was good since I wasn't about to spend $15 on an egg roll. I also wasn't thrilled that the manger didn't come over. Oh well. Anyways I don't think I'll be back any time soon.~~#~0
This place used to be good when Hector owned and operated it.  At that time they also had competent staff.  It has recently with the past few years turned over many many times.  It seems to get worse each time I give it another try.  Their bagels are pretty good when they have them but often the service experience and the lack of inventory makes you want to jump through the glass window.  By the time my church lets out on Sunday they are usually down to the weird bagels and no sesame or poppy.  If there are more than two people in front of you when ordering, just run like hell.~~#~0
Terrible service. The wait staff has real attitude problem. Mongolian beef was chewy.  Moo shu pork plain additional charge for more wrappers!!! Overpriced...for what you get! Go somewhere else!~~#~0
Other reviewers have mentioned the sub-par seats. I concur. Serviceable at best, but not going out of their way to make me comfortable much less enhance my experience.What really makes this place the target of my ire is the so-called "IMAX Experience" theater. I drove a long long way and paid through the nose to see Star Trek. Turns out I would've gotten a comparable experience for less money and without the drive had I been warned that this is NOT an IMAX theater.Don't tell me the sound is better or the film is better. I'm not having it. The differences are marginal and not worth the extra expense. I wanted big, soaring, engrossing, enveloping. What I got was ripped off.I realize that much of the blame here goes to IMAX themselves who have decided to market this "product" in an effort to capitalize on their brand identity, but the theater is still the purveyor and is responsible for seeing to my satisfaction.~~#~0
This business went out of business in October 2011-  A letter posted on their website http://www.youngchefsacademy.com/stores/index.php?id=266  (viewed on 11/28/11) explained their versions of why and also gives information about getting refunds for any groupons, membership tuition balances, BOGO and certificates.  Here is the information directly from the website copy and pasted:  Dear Customer:We deeply regret to inform you that circumstances beyond our control have forced us to send out this notice. Despite our best efforts, Young Chefs Academy of Chandler's doors were closed by the Landlord without notice. What is even more discouraging and disheartening is the fact that the Landlord has refused to work with us to reopen them even though we were the longest standing tenant, we only had three months left on our lease, and we could have had the opportunity to move elsewhere. The Landlord also refused to renegotiate a more market appropriate rate even though they were advertising such rates. As a result of the Landlord's actions, we were forced out of business, and the Landlord kept approx. 95% of our property making it impossible to open elsewhere, so needless to say this has financially destroyed us.As you can imagine, we are devastated along with our staff as we have thoroughly enjoyed working with all of the kids & their families over the past three years providing this excellent service to the community & would like to take this opportunity to thank all of those wonderful customers who emailed the same such sentiments to us.  You will all be missed as well.Sadly, we have weathered the economic storms over the past few years with great plans for the future only to meet our demise in this fashion at the cold and heartless hands of corporate indifference.For those inquiring about Groupon refunds, please contact Groupon Customer Support directly at (877) 788-7858.  For those inquiring about BOGO, Gift Certificates & Member Tuition refunds, the customer will need to file a dispute with their credit card provider indicating "services not rendered" & inform them we are out of business, and you will be reimbursed from the reserve account of our merchant service provider.  This is how we are handling all refunds aside from Groupon refunds (see above) since we are no longer in business.We would like to thank all of our many customers for their loyal patronage, and your business over the past three years has been greatly appreciated.  We sincerely apologize for this tragic turn of events.With best regards,Young Chefs Academy of Chandler~~#~0
I've been to Ra a few times and the sushi is alright.  I usually go for the happy hour drinks because the specials are good. The last time I went though the service was HORRIBLE.  My cousin and I sat down and the server came up and asked for our drinks and food and when we told her we were not eating she told us the we were NOT ALLOWED to sit in the dining room so we ordered edemame.  She also kept coming up and asking if or other guests were coming or not because she wanted to take the menus. It was very wierd. Also the two times I have been there the place has smelled like mildew. I dont think I will go back.~~#~0
SCAM ARTISTS... WATCH OUT FOR THESE STORM CHASERS!So these guys have been trolling our neighborhood in East Mesa (which got ZERO hail last year) and caught my husband outside.  They proceeded to tell him they can only stop and talk to people outside and gave him a giant spiel on how we needed our roof and our AC replaced and how easy that would be through our insurance.One... I work in insurance and filing their bogus claim would either cause our premiums to skyrocket or our policy to be cancelled and two... my husband is a roofer and told them straight up they were full of it and to stop scaring our (mostly) elderly) neighbors with their BS.They haven't... I see three-four trucks a day trolling this street... and we get calls regularly from our neighbors asking my husband to check out their roofs to see if what they are being told is legit... and guess what?  Not a single one of their "omg your roof is going to fall in" stories is legit.Storm chasers... guess what the company my husband works for (here in the Valley for 20 years) does most?  Replace roofs under a year old that these out of state fear mongers told homeowners they needed replaced.  In most cases zero repairs were needed, but instead people got swindled and needed their roof redone by a legit, instate contractor less than a year later.Buyer beware... check out where the company promising you everything is from and ask yourself if you really want to do business with a storm chaser.~~#~0
This is a hair salon that does nails on the side. I think if nails were the main source of revenue they would be better at it and have a wide variety of name brand polishes to choose from.The manicure was below average, I should have suspected as much when I saw the condition of my manicurist's nails & cuticles.I will not be returning.~~#~0
It should have told me something when, during prime bar time on a Saturday night the place had plenty of empty tables.It should have told me something when, those tables were empty right after a sporting event across the street at US Airways CenterIt should have told me something that those tables were empty on a Saturday night, right after a sporting event, AND it was St. Patrick's Day.HUH?  They can't even fill a downtown bar on St. Patrick's Day on a Saturday night after a sporting event next-door?Of course, if I had read the reviews here I wouldn't have tried Tilted Kilt in the first place.The first clue was when one of our group of six, a female, went to the rest room and pronounced it "gross".The second clue was the fact that they didn't quite get the fact that they are supposed to be an Irish pub and this was St. Patrick's Day.The third clue was how they didn't even seem to have a theme, only a very weak imitation of Hooters (I am not a fan of Hooters).Our waitress was actually pretty good.  It was easy for the 6 of us to find a vacant table and she was with us in a few minutes.  She recommended a bomb of a tiny bit of liquor and about 1/8 of a glass of beer.  No wonder she was so enthusiastic about it, they were $17 each (Tilted Kilt does NOT post prices anywhere).We had eaten at the arena so we ordered sweet potato fries.  That was the only food we had so I can't rate anything else on the menu but they were REALLY bad, something dumped out of a frozen food bag.Being a Saturday night, prime time, on St. Patrick's Day do you think there would be some entertainment?  No. Only canned music  Not even a touch of green to mark the day.  Is this place the McDonald's of Hooter lookalike bars?Here is the ultimate insult, though.  One of the drinks I ordered was a Maker's Mark Manhattan.  Now, Maker's Mark is a very premium (and expensive) brand.  Any bar in the world would serve it in a nice glass.  What did Tilted Kilt serve it in?  A tiny plastic dixie cup.  Really?  Really!!!Okay, now I see why there were so few customers and why the reviews here are so bad.  There is absolutely nothing Tilted Kilt offers to even deserve a first visit.~~#~0
I just moved to Phoenix from Chicago and I've also lived in Lexington Ky this is the first time I've seen so many superfluous charges on my electric bill.  If you subtract the $28 to install (when power was already on btw) my fees add up to $50 and my actual electric usage was $30 for the month of december.  I've never seen a delivery charge for electric in my life (gas yes, but that makes sense).  This delivery charge was divided into 2 segments one being $17 and the other $6.  I hope someone can tell me that SRP doesn't have this kind of fees as we are most likely moving to Mesa.~~#~0
Don't get me wrong I actually enjoy the Subway franchise, but recently I went here for a sub and a few hours after I ate and had gone to bed, I woke up and started violently vomiting. Turns out I got food poisoning. Now let me tell you why I think it was Subway, I hadn't had anything else besides a bagel earlier that day for breakfast and I ate there at 2am, which is another thing the food had probably been sitting out for a few hours and silly me HAD to get double meat. I find it kind of humorous that Subway's slogan is "Eat Fresh", and this particular Subway obviously doesn't represent that slogan in a very positive light.~~#~0
Meh - not my crowd at all.  The much younger group in the corner was super snotty and mouthy regarding my group of older coworkers (30s - 40s) as they gave us the hairy eyeball when we dared to come in and take the tables near them.  We were just looking for somewhere mellow to grab a bite and have a few drinks, and you would've thought we were there to put an end to all things joyful in the world.The food was mediocre, the drinks were syrupy sweet, and the overall vibe was trashy.  I wouldn't come back.~~#~0
BAD BUSINESS!!!  BAD BUSINESS!!!  BAD BUSINESS!!!!About 2 months ago I brought my cat in and they gave me an estimate for $100 to do a procedure on him.  I went back in today to get the procedure done and they gave me another estimate for over $700!!!  Their excuse was that first estimate was only good for 24 hours.I'm out another office visit fee only for them to change the estimate.Anyone else ripped off by them?  I would like to take them to small claims court.DO NOT GIVE THEM ANY OF YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!~~#~0
This food sucks.~~#~0
First off, I really hoped I would like this place, because I crave good sandwiches, and I absolutely hate Subway.  My daughter said she was done with over half a sandwich left, I was just like, "There's no way you're telling me you're full off of a couple of bites."  She leaned over and whispered, "It's not good, take a bite and see for yourself."  I did, and it was disgusting.  We think it was the mayo; it tasted like formaldehyde, which brought back dissecting memories from childhood, I almost puked.  I spit my bite out and told her to throw it away.  I ordered a Philly Cheesesteak.  The guy behind the counter was very friendly, talking about how their cheesesteaks are the best and win awards.  I tried it, and it was pretty bad, I couldn't even finish my sandwich.  After a few bites, I threw mine away as well.Unfortunately, we didn't like it and would not go back.~~#~0
I am amazed that anyone liked the food here. I had the spaghetti and meatballs. I mean really, what can you do to spaghetti. Well, I guess you can use old sauce. This stuff was uneatable. The garlic bread was white (that means raw dough). The sauce horrible. Perhaps the sandwiches are better, but i doubt it.~~#~0
Horrible experience.  Contrary to others' reviews, I was not greeted at all when I walked in.  When I ordered chicken nachos to go, this confused them to no end as if I was the first person to ever to have ordered nachos to go, even calling the manager over.  The manager was impatient, unfriendly and unapologetic when I asked if there was a problem.  I walked out before my order was complete, as I will not reward a business for poor customer service.  There are too many other options.  I hope your experience is better, I won't be back.~~#~0
I can't tell you how glad I was to quit this joint. No spin classes available was kind of a downer when I signed up, but I made do. Equipment was always overcrowded or broken, staff was always pushing personal training and would try their best to insult me into signing up. P.s. Not a great tactic guys.The final straw was inquiring about adding my boyfriend to my account, we had been told one price at a different location and when we went to the 91st location to sign up Chad told us that was impossible and that we were ridiculous for coming in and wanting to haggle with him. When we didn't want to sign up for twice the price we were quoted he said "You can do what you want, I don't care!" Before walking away from us.So thanks Chad, now we're both signed up for Gold's Gym~~#~0
Horrible everything.  The unfriendly service, the booths that are falling apart, overpriced bland food.  Go across the street to Roliberto's.~~#~0
Simply put: this place Is overpriced for the quality of foodALSO, driving erratically (such as pulling out onto missouri without even stopping) In the company suv is unacceptable~~#~0
never in my life have i been so happy to dine and dash before. i won't give a time it happened, nor will i ever return, so i honestly don't fear retribution.but after waiting 30 minutes between drinks, and then never saw the waitress again i was so fed up with this place i just walked the fuck out. if they don't care enough about the customers to at least make their rounds every 5-10 minutes to see if we are happy. then they certainly don't care about my money. which by the way i would have been happy to give them. the drinks were good. but i was sober before the next one arrived. unless they are freezing the ice cubes to order, there is no reason for a delay. I'm not going to cause a fuss and complain to the manager. I'm sure the wait on a manager would have been just as bad as the service. so kick rocks. I'm out.from my experience, i really don't think this establishment deserves more then 1 star. i would give 0 if it was possible.~~#~0
The food was good, but the service was strange.  We asked about the happy hour - for drinks and were told $5 for Margarita's - but then it came in a 10 oz beer glass with all ice.  Was very disappointing - way to small for $5 during happy hour. My friends got a big normal margarita glass- but the price was $8 not $5.  The waitress explained the prices wrong to us.  When I complained she only offered to talk it all back, which was not really what I wanted.  I wanted a nice margarita at a happy hour price.   How about  1/2 off or buy one get one?  The waitress just never fixed it, I asked for the manager or owner, she said the owner is in Mexico and that was it.  She said she could not adjust the price of the drinks.  So if you go, be very careful about the pricing of drinks during happy hour.  We will not be going back because of the incident.~~#~0
I don't like to criticize Art not being an artist, nor music not having the balls to get on stage myself. That being said I went to Phix last night to see a band, the place was lacking AC, the bathrooms were disgusting, the sound sucked, the art....I paid $8 bucks for that torture and that hour of my life I will not get back.~~#~0
While I love seafood, I'm afraid I have to agree with the previous poster - had a horrible experience here with one of the Crab Pot dishes - one thing about seafood such as crab, mussels, etc., is that it needs to be very well cooked, or one is asking for trouble!  My dish was not, and as a result, I found plenty of trouble!  It's too bad, because we had gone here in September of 2010, and it was much better.  Things seem to have really gone downhill since then.~~#~0
So, I went to Over Easy once before and it was "ok". Nothing great, they were super short handed, we got a free waffle because it took so long, the chicken fried steak and eggs were grissly but the gravy was good. But, I decided to give it another try. Huge mistake. We get there and the same staff problem..2 servers for the small, but very busy restaurant. My 2 friends each got the same thing, the Wolfpack. It was supposed to be eggs and chz layered between hashbrowns. I got the sirloin steak and eggs with carmalized onions. Their breakfast came out with sliced half cooked country potatoes-apparently they were out of hash browns?! How is that possible...they only serve breakfast and it was 10:30am. Mine came, it wasn't what I ordered. Fine, honest mistake, not a big deal...they went to remake it. Our server never once came over, not once, to apologize or to check to see if the food that did come was ok, which it wasn't. My breakfast came after my friends were done with what they could eat...This is the worst part. It was a plate of watery liuid gravy, grissly meat that looked like dog food, and the eggs were gooey. I took three bites of the eggs, I was starving, and couldnt eat anymore. Horrible. All three of us were still hungry when we left and frustrated as heck. They comped my breakfast... but not a chance Ill go back. I'd rather have Denny's or IHOP any day. I really think a lot of these crazy 4 and 5 star reviews are employees... no way this place was capable of 5 stars.~~#~0
We used to come here quite often but this visit was just terrible. The manager was yelling at her worker and the food (we had oyster pancake and spicy wonton) was aweful. We won't be back for a long long time!!~~#~0
This review started as one about Chompie's at the PV Mall. We will never again go to this Chompie's.  See below:"We have been going to the Chompie's on Shea for over two years and really enjoyed the Hometown NY food and atmosphere. It reminded us of all the good things that you would find at Katz's in lower Manhattan. "Okay, so why the setup for another Chompie's location?  Well the last few times at the Shea location we sat and waited, and waited(15 mins or so) for our waiter to come by and ask us for our drink order. Hey, when you're busy that's to be understood -- but our waiter was on break most of time and the place was half empty.  Also, it seems whenever we asked for anything (pickles, napkins, etc) our waiter seemed fairly indifferent to us.  It happened a few more times on different visits and so we had enough. "Well, our trek in the desert has been rewarded. This Chompie's (PV Mall) is everything the other one wasn't.  The wait staff came by immediately and ask about our drinks order & offered suggestions on different menu items. We were thrilled. We didn't realize there was another Chompie's nearby.  And the food was great (just like the one on Shea)!"From now on we will shlep the extra 10 minutes to the PV Mall location and will try to forget all about the other one over on Shea.  If you're into Katz's and some Catskill theater then you might enjoy the Chompie's on Shea, we didn't!"  When the wait staff stand around talking while you're hungry, it's a real mood kill.So go to Chompie's at the PV Mall and enjoy the food and service and feel free tip generously.  Oh, BTW there's a ton of parking available at PV another difference in their favor.  Enjoy!~~#~0
The waitress couldn't tell me which Shock Top they had on tap, and didn't know that a mudslide isn't always a frozen drink.And thanks place only takes cash.Fuck this place.~~#~0
Had heard a lot of great things about this place, so the hubby and I decided to try it for Valentine's Day this year.  Not sure what happened in the communication, but I am sure that we won't be going back.To start out with, I was upset about the FLYING COCKROACH that crawled out of my salad.  I had to flag down three waiters to remove the item from my table.  No one wanted to help until I actually found my own waiter.  They replace the chopped salad with a new one, which was mediocre at best.  After the salad and before the entree, ANOTHER COCKROACH walked off of our table, which is when I yelled for help.  The owner came by and made a joke of it; there was no apology.  In retrospect, I should have walked out.  Perhaps I'll just call the Department of Health?~~#~0
It is a nice hotel, but not one to get a good night sleep at. I don't know if every room in the place has a sewer line running through it, but mine did. I got NO sleep three nights in a row.~~#~0
I called to order a calzone or calzone style sub and encountered one of the worst customer service experiences of my life.  Though I am sure Kaylin knew what I was trying to order (a pizza calzone special, I was looking at an older menu) she repeatedly acted confused and was rude and indignant.  I have been a longtime customer of this location and that is in serious jeopardy after this experience.  I was put on hold repeatedly, the total call was 7 1/2 minutes and I never ordered due to this treatment.  After the first hold I asked if I could talk to a manager as I thought the employee was new and was not understanding my order.  She informed me she was the only one there, no manager.  After the second or third hold (all the while I was trying to explain I wanted the calzone with pepperoni, ham, peppers, onions, sauce and cheese) I asked her about the manager again, she again responded there was no manager.  I had to ask if there was EVER a manager in the store and what his name was.  She finally told me it was Jose.The message above is what I sent to Hungry Howies corporate headquarters and I requested that they contact me regarding the issue (it's an option on their complaint form).  That was four weeks ago and I haven't heard from them at all.  Clearly the company does not care about customer service.~~#~0
This place is horrible. Chicken was rubber and rice was cold. The restaurant itself was dirty as well.~~#~0
I wish I could give this place 0 stars.  My god, the server really ruined a fun night out for my group.  A large group of friends and I decided to meet here to celebrate two birthdays and watch the ASU game.  By the time I arrived there were probably about 15 to 20 people.  I sat at a table and when the server arrived I asked for a beer and to start a tab with just my boyfriend and I.  IMMEDIATLY the server coughed up an attitude and said everyone was on one tab, sorry.  Since I had just arrived I didnt see a reason why I shoudnt be allowed to start my own tab, so she let me, but not without a couple snarky comments to our table.  My friends let me know that she had been rude from the very beginning, when there was only 4 people to start with.  Anytime she came by the table (which wasnt all that frequently) a couple people were ready for another round.  People would start ordering and she would huff and puff and complain that things were getting just too darn complicated.  Perhaps she could remember things easier if she would have written our order down.  Now let me just say that I can understand a servers frustration with big groups.  I work at a bar myself and things can get complicated.  Perhaps if she reads this review she'll learn that most people want seperate checks, and its just easier to assume that from the beginning to keep things clear.  Also someone commented that she was the only server on the patio.  SHAME ON THE MANAGEMENT for having one server serve a busy patio on a saturday night; not to mention the fight and ASU game were on to make it even busier.Remember that SEPERATE tab I started with my card for my boyfriend and I?  Well it turns out she just decided to throw a bunch of our beers onto the other tab because she couldnt keep things straight.....again, writing things down would really have helped out.  I don't know if the server was new or what, but she was disorganized and incredibly rude.  I couldnt believe how much attitude she was giving us...isn't a large tab a good thing?  I've never before had a server who literally rolled her eyes and walked away from patrons who were looking to spend money!!! UNBELIEVABLE.  WORST SERVICE EVER.~~#~0
Maybe it was just Cinco de Mayo, but I got here just before the lunch rush really got going to order a simple carne asada burrito (regular size) and I waited 45!! minutes for my bag. The kitchen reported they were really backed about 20 minutes into, because they had so many online orders. I had to complain to the owner himself to finally get my food (strange that it magically appeared once he asked what was going on...)**Note to Mr. Bortin** Get rid of the online orders until you figure out your kitchen paces during the lunch rush. It's not fair to people who actually get off there butts to go and place an order at the restaurant by attending to the online orders. There were at least 15 disgruntled customers complaining about the back up.The carne asada burrito - you can get better in LA for about $3.50. It's grand larceny to charge $5.75 for that appetizer size morcel. In fact all your plates sized are poor in value. The ceviche probably is the biggest joke of all.At least they are smiling their way to the bank. Congratulations to the owners on duping the gueros out there who think because the owner's wife is from Mexico and the that the place isn't in a 'shady' part of town they are getting an equally comfortable and authentic Mexican taco shop experience. I guess that means paying "guero" prices too. How many Mexicans do you see queuing up for food in this place? Ninguno!  Think about it people, the value proposition is very low for a taco stand. Don't get caught up in the hype.~~#~0
Won't waste my time coming back here. With nobody around on a Sunday night, the 9:30pm showing of a movie nearly empty, we were refused tickets because I didn't have my ID to prove I was over 21. Really? I'm frickin' old enough to be your mother, kid. Was told we could see another movie on the forks side. For $30? No, thanks. AMC MAJOR FAIL! I'll just spend my money elsewhere.~~#~0
I've stopped in 2 or 3 times now and I have yet to interact with any of the sales people. Every time I've been in there, I've been completely ignored. The last time I went in, I waited by the register to ask a question about signing up for a class, and the women were too busy gossiping with another customer/friend to even acknowledge me.They have a decent selection and their prices are average. But their customer service is non-existent. I won't be returning.~~#~0
I've been traveling every week out of Sky Harbor since 2003 and US Airways is my least favorite airline. So many bad experiences, I can't name them all. I hate their change fees, the flight attendants half-ass their customer service, a low frequency of flights per day, bad baggage handling experiences, and poor customer service overall. Why is this airline still in business??~~#~0
I have been to the Hoosier Cafe twice. The first time I went it wasn't bad. However, the last time my husband and I went it was horrible. We both ordered buscuits and gravy and coffee. We both were so disappointed with our meals we sent them back. We never do this, but it was unedible! The gravy had no flavor and tasted like jellied milk. The coffee was also quite horrible, it tasted like dirty water. I then ordered blueberry pancakes and my husband ordered blueberry waffles. I really should have sent these back as well. The blueberries tasted rotten. Needless to see we will NEVER be returning here and wasting our money again!~~#~0
Terrible service. Manager yelling at employees in front of customers. Giving orders to the incorrect customers. I will never go there again!~~#~0
Went with a group from work.  Ordered the special - beef and sausage and soda.  For $10.03 that is all I got, sliced beef, sausage bun and soda.  Apparently you have ask for anything else like peppers or onions.  Sure with the food server would have mentioned it.  Food was hot, but gosh it was plain.~~#~0
I have come here a couple times because I love the layout for working... Good table space, good wifi, and decent coffee.. a good place to meet people to work too. But holy crap, who are they hiring? There is one girl here who constantly is cursing at absurd volume levels and doesn't stop complaining about everything. The others don't do anything during the slow parts of the day other than "hang out" and talk loudly about their lives, sometimes complaining about work. (They could use that time to clean up a bit, there are dust bunnies everywhere and pretty close to food/drink.) They also seem to use the coffee shop as a place to play their own music, which is usually really loud metal or rock.  This place is really dropping on my scale of places to work. Too bad, the good qualities are just being squashed by the people working here.~~#~0
A nice hotel in appearance, however the staff is condescending and rude.  House cleaning also never visted our room during our stay.  It was a very poor experience overall.~~#~0
Do not get the fish and chips. It was bad. Did I say bad ... It was fucking terrible   ...and they didn't even compensate even though I only ate 3 bites.~~#~0
Worst experience in a security line EVER.  These creeps seemed to be punishing travelers with extremely slow service as they got on the loud speaker and announced in a "nah nah nah nah nah nah" way, that "you all can make this move faster, if you just take the liquids out of your bags."  We watched and rarely had anyone missed a liquid - they were just messing with us.  Have a shot of whisky prior to entering security - otherwise you're at risk of an aggravated assault charge.~~#~0
One star reviews are really rare for me, So much so, that, if I am giving a one star review, I will usually just not even bother to write the review. Coach and Willie's probably deserves better, but for what we paid and the quality of food we got, I have to do what I have to do.  Here goes...We had been given tickets to the Diamondbacks game and, not too familiar with the area, this was the first place we found. The game was starting in a little over an hour when we showed up. Even at that, we did not get bad service, the one star is primarily directed at the food, which was not good.I get very dismayed when something on the menu sounds really good and is such a disappointment. I ordered the Baja Fish Wrap. I love fish tacos and this sounded like something in the same vein. They do give you a choice of sides. I chose the wedge salad. The fish was bland. The lavosh wrap around it was soggy and falling apart. The menu promised spicy sauce... again bland. The wedge salad was a travesty. It was just an unwieldy wedge of lettuce with a small amount of dressing on it. It took up over half the plate. When you tried to cut it it made everything slide off the other side. I gave up on it after the first few bites. It wasn't worth the work and mess. My wife had a nearly identical experience with her tequlila-lime chicken wrap... no flavor at all in any of the food.These sandwiches and two drinks cost us over $50. Hence, one star. We won't be going back here.~~#~0
I'll never forget their sauce.ITS OVER-THE-TOP ON SWEETNESS.I'm sure, that for some ...... they can't get enough of it !Well, for me .... once is enough.~~#~0
Glas Tek 's shoddy work did damage to my vehicle.  They refused to honor their warranty stating is was a manufactures issue.  I had to get another company out to fix the problem.  Never use Glas Tek.~~#~0
I would tear a hamstring to run as fast as I could from this place. Went there for the first time last night. Food is gross. Service sucks. It's uncomfortable. There really isn't one good thing I can say about it. Run away. You'll thank me.~~#~0
Beware, beware, beware - bait and switch and totally unscrupulous tactics used.  Dispatch told me price would be max $15 per lock plus $29 service fee. Technician and I worked out price in advance.  To my surprise when he came in with final invoice he added nearly $200 fees in labor and lock picking fees.  This after being 7 hours late returning to complete the work. He also charged my credit card in advance of giving me final invoice and told me to dispute the charge to "call the number on invoice" and talk to the supervisor.  I called this number and it was just dispatch office that gave me a run around that 1) the technician sets final pricing as per their recorded message and 2) that I would have to work with technician to work things out. They were totally rude and unwilling to help in any way.  When i demanded to speak to corprate office or someone who could make things right, I was told "we don't know the number". When I asked for the official name of the corporate company is  (ie., Pro Keys Discount Locksmith as per voice answering or Roadside Assistance Discount Locksmith as per invoice), I was told they did not know the corporate name!   Did investigation and found that this company presents itself as local to Phoenix but all numbers go to a central dispatch in Chicago, Ill.  The Corporate name of the company is Pro Keys Discount Locksmith.Not only are tactics bad, after a few days of use, some of my locks are sticking and the keys don't work.~~#~0
This place blows.. my mind it's just great entertainment for the whole family... j/k but seriously I would not eat here again. I ordered mac and chz and sucked. it was like pasta with shredded chz mixed in. The hush puppies sucked oily and nothing to em and over done. the beans also sucked nothing mixed in like you would expect from a bbq joint. cole slaw was good! Not too much dressing and very tasty, but I don't go out to eat cole slaw so let's talk about the meat. The ribs were awful.. way too fatty swimming in sauce and obviously reheated in a microwave as some one else stated. The brisket was chopped up so much that it looked like alpo and it too was fatty and swimming in sauce and grease. Good bbq doesn't need to be covered by sauce. It should simply enhance the flavors that are already there. I was highly disappointed because the smoker smelled so good walking up there and what I got wasn't fresh and made my girlfriend and I sick to our stomachs. Also If you dine in they don't give you things like plates and stuff like that. If you need a cup for water they give one like they do at the dentist office for your mouthwash. It might be good for catered events when it's served fresh but what I got was awful awful awful.~~#~0
This is the absolute worst restaurant I have been to in years.  There was no toilet paper in the women's bathroom and it was very, very dirty. Some guy was installing lights in an area right by where we were eating with an electric drill.  The food here is much worse than Denny's . The menu is very limited, very greasy, and the offerings are just weird. Don't get the Indian taco. No sure where they got this recipe but it is an embarassment to Native Americans.  Avoid this place like the plague.~~#~0
This location blows!  From the smug attitude of many of the associates to the downright ineffectiveness of the work they pretend to be doing.  It really is awful.  Unfortunately, this location is the closest to my house.~~#~0
VERY SLOW SECURITY CHECKPOINTThis airport has the worst baggage security checkpoint. Lines are inefficiently placed. X-ray watchers are overly cautious. Baggage check police when called up takes minutes to show up. Not only are they slow but they also seem to deliberately slow everybody down.Out of many many long waits at security over the last year, today, I encountered security slowness on my own baggage check. I did not take my computer off my bag since it does not have a magnetic drive. Computers without magnetic drive are supposed to be fine within bag since they don't affect X-Rays. However, security watcher was overly cautious so he called the police for "bag check". Police guys didn't show up for 10 minutes. Then they finally show up and say I simply needed to take the computer out and run it again The security watcher person could tell me to take the computer out which he didn't have to and I wouldn't miss my flight, neither would other people need to wait. There was also another 10 minutes wait for another passenger god knows why.They also force everyone to go through this backscatter X-rays. I don't know what it is and not sure how safe but it doesn't look like we have an option.~~#~0
What's worse than a chain taqueria with no ambiance, really bad tasting food, and rude staff? Nothing. I almost never eat at these big chain half-fast food restaurants. I didn't have high expectations, but I thought it would be better than taco bell. Wrong. The tacos I got on taco tuesday tasted terrible, and then gave me about 12 hours of food poisoning.Go to a mom and pop taco shop and avoid this place like fire avoids water.~~#~0
Okay, I'm a firm believer in three strikes you're out.  I gave it two tries, but I couldn't even stomach a third time at this place.  God!!!!  I sooooooo wanted to love this little quirky place that reminded me of the beach stands in the few remaining un-yuppified beach towns in California. Well, the atmosphere is there, right down to the funny guys that work the place.  Food is pretty much like music for me, I like all music and I like all food.  I can pretty much find something good in every meal....but not so today.  I take that back...the salsa verde was some of the best I have had.  First try there....wet soggy flavorless fish tacos.This weekend, I sent my hubby down for a couple of burritos (recommended by yelp reviewers actually), I knew it was a gamble, and I wanted to be able to give a good review, so I picked something everyone said was consistently good.  The green beef burrito.  Hubby had a hot dog of some sort.  Little had a bean, cheese and rice burrito.  We were 0 for 0.  My burrito....so cold the cheese didn't melt, so big it couldn't even fold and so wet the tortilla melted.  I don't know if it was so disturbing to eat that I couldn't taste it, or if it just had none.  My husband's hot dog grossed me out just at presentation.  He started to make something else and I said, well at least try it, he did and he had to choke it down.  Little has NEVER turned down a bean and cheese but she took one bite and never looked back.  I want places like this to stick around so bad I'm tempted to print out these reviews and mail them to them.  I'm on a bad review streak.  Gotsta find some good eats soon, maybe Golden Buddah for lunch will turn me around!~~#~0
I have eaten here before and the food is tasty but today when I went in for happy hour at the bar I was shocked at the lack of professionalism displayed by the staff. They were all talking very loud and swearing while showing each other images on their phones. Not only that but the bartender girl was constantly texting on her phone rather than paying attention to her customers. I am pretty sure the manager was there and actually joined in on the locker room type of talk with his employees which was a shame. I couldn't even talk to my girlfriend because they were so loud and distracting. They also were making fun of their customers and their drink choices. All in all I would not go back here after what I saw. How does a place like this that acts like it is upper crust have a staff of unprofessional people up front? As a manager, how do you not have some rule in place that bans phones from employees while they are working? This was amateur hour and definitely not what I expected. Maybe at Olive Garden but even they have rules and their employees don't pick up their phone at any chance they get.The flatbread was tasty. I wish I could have enjoyed it instead of listening to a flamboyant server talk about how drunk he got he night before.~~#~0
Horrible experience. Very dirty and the staff was obviously sick. The man doing my nails kept getting up to blow his nose returning without washing his hands. He then wiped his nose on his sleeve, That's when I had enough! The smell in the salon was horrible. I understand people get sick, but call in sick please!~~#~0
You do get what you pay for!!!.  Had a convention in Scottsdale and wanted to find something more reasonable then the Scottsdale resorts.  Happened upon the Scottsdale Athletic Club and it looked great.  The price was slammin' so I encouraged a colleague and client to get reservations.The rooms had all the charm of Motel 6.  I was really disappointed and embarrassed for my client.  Found myself saying I'm sorry over and over again.  Hope I can save some fellow Yelpers from the same experience.~~#~0
Tough to get a drink here.  My 93 year old mother, her 87 year old friend apparently didn't rate the attention of the table service.  Oh yea, the chicken wings were grossly overdone but no one seemed to care.~~#~0
My first, last and only experience to Great Clips - Tempe, McClintock was absolutely horrible. I was asked by my stylist if I wanted my hair razor cut. I replied, "no it doesn't do anything at all for my hair, don't use a razor". She proceeded too use the scissors to essentially razor cut my hair. IT is the WORST hair cut I have ever had. By the time I realized what she had done it was too late to do anything about it. I have four more weeks of haircut hell to live through. Please dont go here. When I got home one of my room mates told me he had had bad experiences twice at this location and wont return either. Sadly, Great Clips are franchises so there is no main office to lodge a complaint with.~~#~0
Checked out the Skeptical Chymist last night and was seriously disappointed by the food.  Had the Cod Cakes and they were unacceptable.  Basically, it tasted like someone took several scoopfuls of Shake N' Bake, mixed them with with a VERY small amount of fishy substance and baked it.  There was a decent side of mac salad but it was room temperature which makes me a little queasy.  I'll go back for drinks but I'll stay away from the "pub grub."~~#~0
Worst car wash I've ever had. They ended up scratching my windows, what kind of car wash does that. I regret coming here now. Don't come here.~~#~0
I will never eat at this place again. After taking my burrito home I opened it up to apply my hot sauce. Inside I saw an antenna sticking up only to find a roach inside. Never again will I for sure eat at his Filiberto's and probably none others.~~#~0
Everything that is bad about a breakfast place in one spot!1) Overpriced...2 eggs, toast &  sausage for my mom and I had a pumpkin waffle for a total bill of $22 + oh we did have coffee too. That seems like a lot to me.2) The food was cold and the waitress never came by to ask how it was so we could not tell her about it.  What was worse was that she was "training" some new girl.  Good luck with that.3) When we flagged her down to comment on the cold food we were 75% finished so what was the point.  I saw her talk to the manager about it, but nothing was done.  She offered to replace it, but I don't want more cold food.4) When we left the manager who was told about our cold food was the one who checked us out, never asked how it was since he didn't want to hear about the complaint...can you say "CHICKEN SHIT?"Save your self some money and headaches and just go to Denny's get twice as much food for half the $$...~~#~0
UGH. I gave you another chance, Jason, and you served me a pasta salad with more oil than the Exxon spill. Thanks for the headache.~~#~0
I ordered a vegetarian and gluten-free soup from this location and got home and had a chicken chili that was not gluten-free.Not only is this horrible customer service and attention to detail, but it is dangerous to customers that have a gluten allergy. I will NOT be coming back.~~#~0
I saw their commercial and looked at the menu online.  It looked decent enough.  Total meal was $50.00 for three people and the food was AWFUL. My daughter's burger was dry, my steak was oily and greasy and my wife's spaghetti squash had a nasty sauce.  My wife also had the salad bar and she said that was bad too.  The little muffins they serve you were the best part of the meal.  I eat out quite a bit and love places like Chipotle, Salt Cellar, Vincitorios, Flemmings and many others but this place is terrible.  I'm just hoping I don't get sick this evening.  You've been warned.~~#~0
Not happy at all. My son bought his second Ipod a year ago. The first broke, and when we took it to the apple store, they said "tough luck." So, I told my son to make sure to take really good care of the new one. He did. For no reason, it stopped working. We sent it to be repaired and got it back saying "water damage." No way. So we went to the store and told them about it. The floor guy said to wait and he'd have a "genius" look at it. He came back and said "no water damage. Make an appt for tonight and they'll fix it." Went back, saw a "genius" and told him the story. Without looking at it, he said must be water damage. We said impossible. He said well, this square hole will be red if it's water damage...yup, water damage. I took the flashlight from his hand and looked. It was white. I know red from white, and this was white. Oh, he said, I meant that there's a little red line. No red line. Oh, I meant that there's a red corner. No red corner. He shows it to someone who glances and says yup, red. This is nuts. Talk about spitting in your face and saying it's raining. They insist it's red and there's water damage and won't look into why this well taken care of ipod won't work. Son not allowed to buy another one. MP3 next.~~#~0
Unfortunately, unless you use the City of Tempe or buy your own paddle boards, this seems to be the only rental for SUPs and kayaks on Tempe Town Lake. Price was good for the service they offer. My issue is the customer service which was rude. I can understand if someone is having a bad day but not when it's through more than one interaction. The female employee that I encountered on the telephone and then in person made me uninterested in returning here in the future.. I would choose one of the other lakes to rent and do water play on. And, encourage others to do the same.I brought a large group of first time paddleboarders and she treated each of us rudely- as if we were a big pain and clearly a waste of her time. It was very uncomfortable, so we didn't say anything at the time. I don't stand for this kind of customer service- it's not worth my time. In this day and age, how you treat your customers is super important in creating a business that is supposed to be a fun experience.~~#~0
Ugh!  I think I am going to be sick!  Please let the record reflect that I did not choose this restaurant.  It was chosen as a meeting place by my sister-in-law sight unseen.  Located in kind of a dingy strip mall, the place was pretty full on a Sunday night.  We took this as a good sign.  The staff was friendly and was very good about bringing drink refills and clearing plates.  The restaurant was relatively clean.Let's get down to the heart of eating out, though, which is FOOD.  The food ranged from unexceptional to bad.  The eggrolls, jalapeno chicken, and fried wantons were not bad, but nothing special.  The coconut shrimp was the best thing  I ate and was actually tasty, but very heavy and greasy.  The hot and sour soup was okay.Do not be tempted by the sushi.  I am skeptical anytime I see sushi at a buffet, but decided to try it anyway.  It was TERRIBLE!  The one nigiri I had was just awful.  The fish was not fresh and the rice was bland.  The one California type roll was similarly AWFUL.  I hope that sushi virgins are not getting this as their first taste of sushi, because it will turn them off to sushi forever.The other items to choose from were standard Chinese buffet fare, but bland and greasy.  Nothing special here.  I was too afraid to try very much.After eating at Great Wall Buffet, I feel cheap and dirty, but I did not even enjoy the experience.  If I am going to be so bad, it had better be so good.~~#~0
One of the illegals they have working there broke my driver's seat (the upper back part) and when I brought it to the manager's attention they of course said they weren't liable. I don't know if the guy did it on purpose or not, but it definitely was not broken before I took the car to them, and to break it at that point in the seat I imagine you would have to put a lot of pressure on it.~~#~0
This review is only for the food and drinks on the patio.  The view is beautiful!  But the food and drinks were lame.  I used to work here in the late 80's and the kitchen was so filthy that I swore I would never eat there again (food was good back then) - I can tell you stories!This past weekend we were at the Renaissance Festival and since my mom lives near the resort  we thought we would give it a try on the way to her house. I don't know if the kitchen is clean (one would hope) but the food quality is definitely poor.~~#~0
I went here in November 2003 and was not impressed at all.  The place is dark, dirty and dingy...my burger was small, overcooked (and I like things well done!) and not all that impressive - taste wise.  The fries/onion rings were about average and the cost was not as cheap as many people would like you to believe.Now, keep this in mind - I had yet to try In-N-Out Burger when I decided I did not like The Chuck Box...once I had In-N-Out, it was all over for The Chuck Box.I have no idea why anyone would go here with In-N-Out only a short distance away.  In-N-Out tastes better, it's cheaper and definitely cleaner...I wonder what frequent visitors to the Chuck Box think about it being dark as hell...maybe to cover up the grime?~~#~0
I moved to Phoenix from Peoria where I had the luxury of my posh Mountainside Fitness. I am by no means a gym snob. I will take grungy sweat laden power lifting gym any time. But I digress.I was very disappointed to find that the center of the city has no gyms. Well, not a cornucopia of options as one might think. Thus I wandered in to 24 Hour Fitness for my free 7 week pass.Upon entering i thought maybe I walked through some sort of space-time continuum that brought me back to high school. The decor was straight out of a 90's pop culture movie.I decided not to judge by the cover, so I approached the desk for my pass. The desk clerk played '50 ways not to give this woman a free pass' with me. That was fun. Maybe he thought I would actually use the equipment.After pulling teeth to get the location of weights and restroom... Yes I had to ask all of these things... I went upstairs to find myself in nothing short of the twilight zone. The equipment was so old I needed a manual to figure out how to move the pins on the squat rack.And the freaking floors were linoleum. I'm a figure athlete and amateur powerlifter, so this wasn't going to fly. I can't slide all over the floor when doing plyo pushups or dead lifts.The front desk guy would wander around staring at people, then walk over to the dumbbell rack and do a set of curls. What's up with that?Anyway, overall this place was the dirty armpit of the city. For serious lifters, you are better off pushing stones uphill like Sisyphus.~~#~0
I've been to the Breakfast Club dozens and dozens of times, but I will never  go there again. On Saturday, I attempted to go with my husband and 2 friends - and the hostesses wouldn't seat us. My friend and I got there and were told of a 30-40 minute wait. As we were waiting for our husbands to join us, this was no problem for us. Then..they got there, and we still weren't seated. When I went to check with the hostess, my name had been crossed off list. Now, we were waiting by the front door, but I know my name was never called. I was kind, understanding that mistakes are made, and I was informed that we would be seated next. She then proceeded to seat a group of our size that had arrived after us. I went back up to the hostess station and demanded to know why people who had arrived long after us were being seated before us. The hostess lied to me, telling me that she hadn't told me we were to be seated next, but that we were just "coming up." I was shocked that I was getting the runaround, so I took the news back to my group, and as we were discussing whether or not to leave, the hostess seated ANOTHER group of our size that had just arrived instead of us. At this point we got up to leave. The hostess, seeing we were leaving, said "you know you guys are coming up." Whether that was a taunt or what I will never know, but I do know that I will never go there again. It was ridiculous to be treated like a second class citizen while trying to get breakfast. I would rather eat at Denny's, which I loathe, as I know they will at least seat and serve me.~~#~0
Man, this place cost me a ton of money and did crappy work.  The brakes they use are metal, so the crud on my wheels was nasty and the life of the brakes was fleeting.  When they would fix one thing, lo and behold something else needed to be fixed.  Mainly my fuel pump, which caused my car to have major start issues once replaced.  The fuel pump was because my gas guage suddenly stopped working after they had replaced my struts.  They could never get my tires balanced.I regret the money they took from me and think about 1/2 the work they did on my car was not necessary.~~#~0
I live very close to this location of Julioberto's and I have eaten at this location several times. The food has always been fast and good. However my experience last night changed my opinion of the restaurant. I am solely basing my review on this experience. Last night I went through the drive-thru and when I came to the window, I noticed individual styrofoam cups sitting on top of the soda fountain. A few seconds later I saw an employee drinking out of a styrofoam cup. He took a few sips, and then poured out the rest of his cup into the soda fountain drain below the dispensers. That freaked me out a bit, but not as much as what happened next. He then rinsed out his cup using the water dispenser on the fountain. He sloshed it around and then poured out the contents. The contents splashed all over the dispenser and into the ice maker that was just below the drain. He then placed his drinking cup on top of the dispenser with the rest of the styrofoam cups. Water was still dripping off the side of the cup and on to the fountain.  A second later another employee started filling my cup with ice from the same ice maker.  When I expressed disgust at what I had just observed, I was told, "It is okay."  I am not sure that she understood what I was trying to tell her, because she was confused as to why I no longer wanted a soda. The lack of hygiene appalled me. I won't be back.~~#~0
When I had to start looking for an interlock company to complete my court ordered 12 months with an interlock device in my vehicle I found Driver Advisors.  The reason that I chose this company is that the website claimed that their devices did not need a "warm-up" time like other devices offered by other companies.  This was simply not true.  I had my interlock installed in January and if I needed to start my car in the morning when  the weather was cold I would sit in my car for 3-5 minutes waiting for the device to warm up.  It may not seem like a long time but deal with it every morning and you will be frustrated.  Besides that issue I was treated well by the staff who is very friendly and professional.  That is why they receive one star, simply for the staff.  My main gripe happened just recently.  It was a Saturday afternoon and I was leaving my morning job to go home and get ready for my evening job.  I entered my vehicle just after 1pm and was not happy to find that my interlock device was not working.  I called Driver Advisors who then transferred me to the service department.  I was told they would replace my handset if I could make it to the office.  When I informed them that I could not make it because I did not have the time or means of transportation they told me that I would be contacted "shortly" by a roadside technician.  Nearly an hour passed without receiving a phone call.  I called the office again and was given the same information.  After waiting another half hour or so I called again to listen to an answering machine telling me I was calling during non business hours.  I paid for cab fare to my apartment and then again to my evening job.  I was at work already when the roadside technician called me over 3 hours later.  They claim to offer a 24/7 emergency hotline but when I called that number I received an answering machine repeatedly.  Oh, by the way I did not receive a new handset until after 5pm Monday evening. I am writing this now waiting for a call back from the general manager of Driver Advisors.  I have been waiting almost exactly one hour for that phone call.  I would not recommend this company.~~#~0
I notified the owner of my issue directly and despite his tendency to respond to reviews online, I haven't received a response from him in over a week providing any apology or explanation so here it is...I cancelled my pest control service after a billing dispute.  I did this not because of the error, that happens, no big deal.  I cancelled because of the very rude attitude and customer service of the office staff.  In June I gave Probest my debit card number so they could just automatically deduct the monthly service from my account instead of writing a check each month.  I was charged in June and then double in July.  I called in to inform the staff of the double billing and they said they would have to call me back.  All of this was just a minor inconvenience up until this point.  Then Bonnie calls me back...I'll spare you the details of the conversation for brevity's sake however Bonnie proved to be quite incapable of handling the billing issue.  She seemed like an older lady with a southern drawl and genrally unpleasant attitude and seemed uncomfortable with their billing system and technology.  On our third go-round where she insisted I wasn't charged for June I told her in a firm (I stress I was NOT rude, yelling, cursing, etc... just firm) tone I was indeed charged in June and I expected it to be fixed.  This is where she turned from generally irritated and unhelpful to flat out argumentative and belligerent, yelling at me that it was my fault because I wasn't helping her enough.  I asked her calmly but firmly to please cancel my service and I would take up the issue with my bank.  She then hung up on me without saying another word.  I had to call back to confirm my service was in fact cancelled, she said she hung up on me because "once I said I wanted my service cancelled there was nothing more to discuss".  Roughly a half hour later she calls me back and sheepishly says she found the charge for June. When I politely ask if an apology is in order for the way I was treated she absolutely refuses to apologize and starts arguing with me again!  She was going on about how much paperwork she had to go through to find the charge, as if I am the one responsible for the poor billing records.For what it's worth the service itself was pretty average, the guys showed up and were nice enough, however I never really noticed a change in the scorpions I was looking to get rid of.  Finally, I'm NOT accusing Probest of impropriety but it is a general curiosity and coincidence that after several years of never having an issue with my bank/card that shortly after my dispute I had fraudulent charges on the same debit card I gave Probest.~~#~0
Ever see that film by Morgan Spurlock about McDonald's called "Super-Size Me?" I didn't eat at McDonald's for at least two years after being grossed out by that movie! That being said, my Wife and I were super tired, heading out for a camping weekend at night, and we needed something to eat. Along Shea Blvd there in Fountain Hills, there's Wendy's, which I have given up on (expensive, small, and crappy); Taco Bell (NEVER); Arby's (weird, fake roast beef); Subway (genera-sandwich); & a few others. Long and the short of it is this... This food was just plain lousy, tasteless, grotesque, cold, and supremely awful! Had some chicken-part nuggets dipped in sugar sauces of your choice, an "Angus" burger, and the fries were cold, gritty, and tasteless. I really can't understand how and why people eat "food" at these places? Besides the totally disgusting food, the bill was like 18 bucks for the two of us, there were flies all over, and people were smoking just outside the entrance. I was grossed out for the rest of the evening- So much so, we postponed the camping trip and left the next morning because we were both a little upset to our stomachs. Think I'm exaggerating? Go eat there yourself.~~#~0
1. It's a "brewing company", but they don't make or sell their own beer! 2. The guy next to me asked to order food 3 times, and still didn't get to do so. When the staff couldn't figure out how to change the TV channel he had enough and left. 3. Plastic wear. 4. Creamy Italian dressing packet for a caesar salad with brown lettuce. 5. The food actually came from Jody Maroni's next door. 6. Darkest beer they had was Fat Tire. 7. Bland burger with stale bread.~~#~0
The Bad Egg is a joke. I am not sure if they are going out of their way to deliver a subpar breakfast, but it seems like it. For my part, I made the mistake of ordering a frittata...what was delivered was laughable...a dish of egg sprinkled with a few of the listed ingredients...this was just a pathetic open omelet and nothing like any frittata that I have ever met. All five of us were completely let down by what was delivered. The only upside is that the wait staff are affable, unfortunately, their service can't redeem the output from the staff in the kitchen.~~#~0
Stay away from these thieves.  This "company" is run by a bunch of incompetent twentysomethings who are more interested in stealing your money and then not providing the service they promise.  I got taken for over $100, with no explanation, no returned phone calls, etc.  Had to report them to the BBB.A bigger group of f*ck ups I have never seen.~~#~0
The menu only exists in order to know what the restaurant doesn't have.  I understand it's only been open a little over a month, but running out of just about everything means they are very poorly managed and have a very poor business model.I was here twice in April, "New England" month.  Unfortunately for them, I lived in Boston for 5 years.  Let's hope they don't try to do New England ever again in the future.  The chowder was terrible.  The RI style calamari was a joke.  There were literally 5 pieces of squid on the plate (and no lemon).  After those, I was too scared to order any of the other regional dishes.On my first visit, very shortly after they had opened, a friend ordered a Mai Tai right off the specialty drink menu.  It was served to her and she immediately noticed it was the wrong color.  "Where's the dark rum?"  "Oh we ran out of dark rum so I just put some more light rum in it."  Note to bartender - if someone orders a drink and you don't have the right ingredients, ask if they would mind a substitution.  My bet is that they might order something different.Later in the month on the second trip, we tried to order the crab mac and cheese.  Nope, sorry, out of crab mac and cheese.  So instead I ordered the Chop Salad.  Amazingly, it didn't have pine nuts and the smoked salmon somehow turned into grilled salmon.  By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known.  Rather than attempt to fix the situation, the bartenders and servers all started to ignore us.  Finally the manager came over and I explained to him that what I had received in the Chop Salad wasn't anywhere close to what was described on the menu.  He literally asked me, "Oh, are you in the business?"  No, I just happen to be able to read, and I just happen to know what I'm eating.  He explained that they've been very busy and therefore had run out of lots of things.  Note to manager - smoked salmon, pine nuts, crab mac and cheese, and dark rum are not rare, exotic ingredients.  You run out of something, you go buy more.  Or you explain to customers that what they ordered isn't what they will get.  Apparently he didn't like hearing that there are some people that know the difference, and he started to treat us in a very condescending manner.  I'm not the douchebag here, buddy.  Clearly, YOU are the douchebag.  If you don't know how to run a restaurant, don't become a restaurant manager.  Simple.Oh, lest I forget.  We had actually ordered 2 chop salads after being told that they counted under the 2-for-1 entrees grand opening special.  When we got the check, we had to have the bartender remove one of the salads as we were charged for both.  Almost got us, Regions.  Almost got us.Since my group was in a small rush to get to the La Bocca Yelp event, the manager - Keith? Kyle? Kevin? - offered to buy us a round if we came back later.  Not ones to ever refuse free alcohol, we did return later in the night after the yelp event.  And we brought lots of friends - our group of 5 turned into 11, all ready and willing to give Regions our business.  Lo and behold, the manager didn't comp us a round of drinks, even though we made it clear that's why we had returned and we were wiling to stay there if shown some love.  All he had to do was take the 5 kamikaze shots off the bill and it might have made up for the rest of the night.  Guess not.  Well done.  Love the honesty.In conclusion:  food sucks, service sucks, management SUCKS.  But it benefits from a great location, so I'll probably wind up giving it another chance when in Tempe/Mill Ave.~~#~0
Oh the HORROR!! I can here on a lunch date with my husband and two year old. We had an hour since it was on my husbands lunch break, and decided on this place because I was craving some "street tacos", and the reviews/pictures looked awesome.... oh how I was wrong!!Seems easier to number all the issues we had!1. We walk in at 12:10 to a nearly empty restaurant, I first try to use the bathroom, and the light wasn't working... that should have been my first clue. 2. We sit down and a few minutes later the place is packed, but for some reason everyone has been help except us!?! 3. Finally someone comes to help, I ordered the horchata since it was mentioned so frequently in the reviews, my husband ordered a Sierra Mist (remember it came in a to-go cup with a lid)  The horchata was bizarra, and $44. My 2 year old daughter grabs the free chips.. and I see MOLD on it, then realize the whole basket is full of moldy chips!! No wonder they are free!5. A different waiter finally shows up since the other waitress was busy taking care of the customers that came AFTER us... I ordered the Sonora Arrachera Taco, and told them about the MOLDY chips, he apologized and took the chips away.  The original waitress came back, apologized for the chips, and said she would comp the drinks, I returned the horchata, and got a Sierra Mist as well (also came in a to-go cup, there's a reason I am mentioning this)6. After 20 min and being there for 40 and food had not arrived I asked for it to-go. about 5 min later it came along with the bill that only included the food.By this point I was annoyed but probably wouldn't have given it 1 star, so we leave with to-go cups in hand along with food. I dropped my husband off at work, then drove home. When I got home I ate 1 taco which was pretty good, the meat was flavorful and tender, I only wished I had some of that salsa to add to it. Then I got a text from my husband.....7. My husband asks "is your Sierra Mist BROWN??? I  open the lid and sure enough it looks like dirty water!!!Seconds later the entire meal... is in the trash! VOMIT!   I gave this place more chances then I ever give a place. WILL NOT BE GOING BACK!~~#~0
I'm writing this review purely as a seller. So I am a total shopaholic!  I guess that's what happens when you work in the industry.  Anyways, I cleaned out my closet and came here and they literally took 1 pair of jeans out of maybe 40-50 items.  I mostly brought in some old work clothes from Banana Republic and just some odds and ends that no longer fit.  This place is solely for indy/punky/trendy, which they do make quite clear so they are what they say they are which is good.  Makes me kind of wonder how many people buy and sell back the same items though...~~#~0
Don't waste your time or money. Mediocre sandwiches, too expensive because they come with no sides at all, not even a plate; you have to eat off the wrap it comes in and below average service. I'll never go back.~~#~0
Well I was thinking to myself last night that I would be giving this location a 3. HOWEVER, that just went down the drain. Last night the hubs and I ate dinner here. I am currently on this strict vegan diet, so I asked the waiter if the black bean burger was vegan. He said he wasn't sure but that he would check. A minute later he comes back and says yes it is. SCORE! I eat half of it and boxed up the rest for lunch, which I will no longer be able to eat BECAUSE THE DAMN BURGER IS NOT VEGAN! I went on PJ's website this morning to find out calories and what not, because I track that stuff, they had a whole section listing what is vegan and what is not,and sure as shit, the black bean burger was listed on their site as NOT being vegan...why the staff doesn't have access to this info I do not know. So anyway.....Our actual experience was ok. This time around all the employees were actually dressed and no goods were hanging out. Our waiter sucked. He never checked on us once the food came, never came to give us refills, our plates were cleared away by someone else, a box was brought to me by someone else, we had our credit card sitting on the table for a good ten minutes waiting for the bill. They did get a wee bit busy, but they seriously had about 6 people working that night for that very small location. I'm not sure what is up with this location. It has always been like pulling teeth to get decent service there. The food is always good but the service is lacking.~~#~0
I went into this store one day looking for Fox Farm soil. The dark haired guy that was there was very friendly and said it would be a week or so. I went back in to see about a couple of other items and the light haired guy proceeded to tell me that I was doing things wrong and that I needed to start over with all new stuff. Mostly because he said that the Fox Farm soil had bugs in it, to which I replied, "Haven't had a problem ever." Then i thought to myself, "If the soil has mites or whatever in it, then why is it in your store?" But after reading that other review I think the bugs aren't in the soil.I told him I wanted what I wanted and that I would think about his suggestion instead of just jumping in. His attitude changed immediately and he stated, "We've been doing this for 25 years, we know what we are doing." Cool, that's good to know. I will be sure to tell the guys at S.O.G. as they have made a lifelong customer out of me.Sorry dark haired guy, you were cool.I'll be the first to admit that I'm stubborn, abrasive and a novice who is no way perfect. I just think if you back off on the hard sell you would have at least sold some nutes or something. Instead I felt like this guy was trying to pressure me into doing something I didn't want to do. NOPE!If there was a way to give less that one star I would.~~#~0
I don't think I would be rating this place so poorly if it didn't seem like such a letdown.  This place really does look very nice from the outside.  The fountains are a nice touch.  But the bugs really are too much.  Let me also say that I'm an Arizona native.  I'm not particularly squeamish about bugs, because c'mon ... they're like all over the place in the desert.  After our eleventy-fifth ant infestation (nothing like enjoying a nice night of TV and seeing an ant -- or five -- crawling up your arm!), and after seeing our 10th gigantic cockroach, and after hearing other residents complain about scorpions ... scorpions ... I think I'm ready to start looking elsewhere.  I would advise you do the same.  This place is a lot closer to 7th street than you might imagine, and it really belongs in Sunnyslope -- not Phoenix, like the address suggests.~~#~0
Unfortunately there are not many late night fast food places open 24hrs in Surprise.  Avoid this Jack in the Box even though they are 24hrs.  The night employees are rude and slow.  Even had them lie and tell me their system is down.  Even offered to pay cash but they told me they couldn't do anything.  They need a computer to make a burger??~~#~0
if you are a non smoker be prepared to be a smoker, they smoke right outside the door on the patio, the staff & smoker patrons will not let you keep the door closed & if you try  you will be verbally assaulted. You are forced to breathe their carcinagins. Finding a new place to go. It is also very loud even with ear plugs.~~#~0
This is a little, local owned store that pales in comparison to other local owned stores.  Having had reptiles, fish and birds my whole life, I would never buy anything from the wild, and this place has a reputation for having cheap prices because of the low quality of their animals.  I have found wild caught animals in this store repeatedly.  I have also seen animals very improperly housed, along with feces in the cages.I have also had a conversation with the owner who was dropping some very racist bombs into the conversation about our current president and anyone who speaks multiple languages.  It seems that all of the knowledge they have is only gained from elementary readings and minimal experience.  Their fish selection looks as though it was an old Walmart setup, which means if one fish is sick, they are all sick.It is hard to tell people not to support a family owned business, but with a racist husband and a lady that never moves from her stool behind the counter but has an attitude on her, and with experiences as described above, it gets somewhat easier to tell you to go to another store.  It is worth it to drive to another pet store that does not support taking animals from the wild, does not hire weirdo's, and has a less "racist" staff.  I know of another reptile store at Bell and Cavecreek that has a much, much better selection.~~#~0
This location has the WORST service I have ever seen. I mean, I know people make mistakes once or twice, but EVERY time I eat here something goes wrong. I've had food not given to me that I paid for, really terribly cooked food, and order mess-ups all at this location in just the past few times I've been here. Come on, really, you work at a FAST FOOD place. How hard can your job be? The only reason I keep returning here is because its right near my apartments but it looks like from now on I'll be going out of my way to go to the location on University.~~#~0
Very Americanized restaurant! Service was fine, but I didn't feel comfortable enjoying food. The spring rolls came out as a big disappointment to me, it was even smaller than my 2 fingers! I didn't order the Pho, but I came up with Papaya salad which was also a waste: too sour (too much lime juice) and not even tasty!I'd prefer more authentic Vietnamese restaurant with decent prices! This probably is a suitable place for Americans, but I'm sorry, not for me! I'd prefer Pho All Seasons or Pho Ao Sen - much better!Well, gotta try it at least once anyway!~~#~0
Go for the drinks, not the food. The food is dreadful.~~#~0
I consider myself an expert on breakfast. I know this place is all the rave, but I think it stinks. Let me list the reasons. First, the place is tiny. Second, you can never get in. Third, the food is OK, and their soda sucks; they serve RC! Fourth, the place is always hot in the summer. Fifth, when you finally get a seat it is uncomfortable (They serve fat people food, but yet their seating is set up for a 5'1" 100 pound girl). Sixth, it is a small neighborhood place so you would think people would be nice, but they are pretty stand offish. If you have ever been to nasty truck stop (versus a good one), this is the same type of food and atmosphere. Unless you are a yuppie and looking to slum it and want to say you experienced it, I suggest skipping this place.~~#~0
Yes, this is the hotel from those commercials where the guy does something like oh I don't know perform open heart surgery and when asked if he's a real surgeon, says,"no, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night." Har har! What delightfully witty banter.That commercial encompasses the vibe you get when you stay here. The HIE is always ready to remind you how Smart you are for staying here. In fact, everything in the room from the pillows to the shower curtain to the bars of soap all incorporate the Smart "theme" in their branding.Since my company pays for my trips to Phoenix, I can't comment on the value of the hotel, but I can speak to the experience. For such a SmartHotel, the room layouts are inefficient. the bathroom counter (completely covered in little pamphlets advertising the smartness of the various items strewn about the room) is massive while the main room (a combination bedroom, office, lounge, dining room, etc) is an ergonomic nightmare.For instance, once I removed the 17 pamphlets from the SmartDesk, I realized that the SmartLamp and the SmartPhone left little room for my laptop and mouse.I then picked up the crusty staticky SmartPhone, ordered SmartRoomService (which comes from the Hilton Garden Inn kitchen next door), and upon the meal's arrival had to remove my laptop from the SmartDesk, since it's the only thing which remotely resembles a SmartTable.I then turned on the SmartTV, A boxy Zenith CRT circa 1956, and ordered a SmartMovie, presented only in full-screen for $11.99+tax. After several attempts at setting the SmartAlarm, I just called the front desk on the SmartPhone, also circa 1956. Are you noticing a trend here? The same crappy, out-of-date appliance as any other Holiday Inn but with the word 'Smart' slapped across it and a pamphlet resting atop the closest hard surface, boasting how clever the aforementioned appliance is and how Smart you are for staying in a hotel that contains such a Smart appliance.Okay, on the good side, The SmartStaff was very friendly and accommodating and provided me with complimentary SmartToiletries I has taken from me by airport security. They were also kind enough to remove a SmartMovie charge on my bill from when I accidentally ordered some SmartCrappyMovie on Pay-Per-View.The complimentary SmartBreakfast provided me with plenty of healthy and tasty options. The SmartCoffee was adequate. If you were Smart enough to read through this entire SmartReview, but you think my constant use of 'Smart' before every other word seems annoying, then you now know what it's like to stay at a HIE.~~#~0
So I have been into this place twice and both times left me swearing I was gonna torch the place. If you ever want a good example of how not to treat customers this would be it. The  manager was even arrogant and rude. First time we went in we got a set of glasses that weighed a lot so i managed to get the cart into middle of the street before the front end manager came running out the door to tell me that I must bring the cart back. I asked her if I could just take my glasses to the car laughing and saying they were heavy. she replied absolutely not, bring it back inside now. so I left the cart in the middle of the street and walked away with my purchases and told her to get it herself if it was that big a deal for her. She shouted happy holidays to you too. I flipped her off and walked away. The next time I went in with my 14 year old cousin. As I am walking in I had a coke in my hand from one of the restaurants there and I was told i needed to not carry it through the store. The security guy told me he would hold it for me If I liked. I told him I was done with it and asked if they had a trash can at the counter. They told me I would have to go back outside the store to throw away the soda. Exceptionally rude the whole time I went to another store and will not be returning to shop there ever again.~~#~0
I stopped in here before a meeting to grab something to eat with my husband. We love the concept and the design is wonderful. The cupcakes look great but the vanilla one I had was awful. The frosting was made of cream cheese (they should have mentioned this somehow) and was a gorgeous sparkly pink. It had been in the fridge and was hard and stale and tasted like it hadn't been made with cake flour but all purpose, heavy and gluey flour.  My husband got the cobb wrap and it was sweet and he didn't care for it. I got an egg salad on a croissant, and the best thing about my lunch was the Frito's they added to the plate. They put in all kinds of stuff in the egg salad (were those dates?) and  I regretfully had to throw it away, along with my cupcake.The cupcakes look great, but save yourself the trouble, and don't.~~#~0

I went into this UPS to ship my package and the service was great when they were getting my money. However,  I had a situation where the package had to be shipped back a few days later so the UPS store out of town had to ship it back to the store it came from. When I went to pick up the package the owner was RUDE and treated me like I was a child. She insisted that I was crazy and that the package could not be delivered there. I was in shock when she started to talk to me slowly like a child explaining how "shipping" works!The funny part, sure enough, my package was delivered there and I had to keep calling to make sure it was not sent back. The issue wasn't really the package situation but the customer service....don't be rude and uppity. Plus she charged me $5 to pick up the package from her store saying it was a "private location". WTH?? its UPS..the least private place in the world.Anyway, I would have gladly paid for any error on my part if the customer service was good. She threw the package on the counter when it was picked up...there was a laptop in there! This UPS store has turned me into a FedEx customer. I am sooo fed up with bad customer service!!~~#~0
The staff is very friendly and I like the quiet, convenient location. My favorite thing is probably the fitness center, it's small and sometimes warm, but there's usually a cardio machine available and they all have individual TVs. The pools are nice too and they have monthly community events. I've not been, but I appreciate that they're offered. So, why the poor rating? Well, because you get what you pay for and as one of the cheapest places to rent in North Scottsdale, you don't get much. This is my third edit of this review and I'm trying to make it as concise as possible. Basically, the maintenance sucks and the disappointing quality of my unit combined with the unresponsiveness of the service staff just adds frustration and takes away the ease that is supposed to come with renting. I've submitted more work orders in ten months at Broadstone Ancala - including four AC issues - then I have at any of the other communities I've rented at combined. I've also had more work orders ignored than I've submitted at any other place I've lived. Some issues I've fixed myself and some I've decided weren't worth the hassle or having to bug management to get them done. Others I've submitted multiple times before having it handled. After my first poor review on Yelp regarding my second AC issue, I got a response from the property manager and she offered a nice apology and a concession on my rent, but so much has gone wrong since then (including being charged that concession the next month) that that is a distant memory and I cannot wait to get out of here! Unfortunately they require two months notice, so I've still got some time (and more maintenance issues, no doubt) to suffer through.~~#~0
BUYER BEWARE!We recently purchased a dishwasher at this location. It seemed to be in good condition, it's a Whirlpool Gold, and we got if for almost half the regular price. It only had a dent in the back. The tag did not indicate that it had been previously owned, or even refurbished. It looked good, got a good financing deal, so we purchased it.Today was the first time we ran it with our dishes. It was weird, I started noticing dried-on food on all my dishes....now, we don't usually put our dishes in with out rinsing them first, so I thought it strange......THEN, as I was removing the glasses from the top rack, I noticed something black coming out of the water holes of the upper blade.....Odd, I thought. I called my husband over  to show him, and as he is Mr. Fix-it himself, he began to take everything apart. We found pieces of old rotting orange peel and celery EVERYWHERE!! Inside ALL of the blades, the tubes, everywhere! (no, we had not recently been eating oranges OR celery for that matter) I think the washer had been previously bought, the owner probably ran it without securing the trap, it probably clogged so they returned it; Sears wipes it down and sells it to us, with old food still stuck everywhere in it. YUCK, this is like a health hazard! We were so grossed out....We did manage to get all the food out our ourselves, ran the thing with nothing in it a few times, and it seems to be fine now. I'm just wondering how this got past Sears inspection with flying colors??Anyways, if you choose to shop here, just beware. There are great deals, but remember, you get what you pay for :/~~#~0
It's a cool looking place but the crowd was very random. From dressy to gym shorts the atmosphere was off for me. Service wasn't great, brought our appetizers with our main meals and we had no room on our table. Had to use the ledge next to the table for the dishes. Our waitress took forever clearing the plates and we were given two bills by two different staff members. Given all that the food was average.~~#~0
If I could give them no stars I would. I have had several bad experiences with them. 1. Went to Rome with my family. They let me on the plane phoenix to ohio fine but when it came time to go to rome they woudn't allow us on the plane. This was when the country just started using passports instead of birth certifigates but I was told a birth certifigate would be fine. So they decide not to tell us until Im STRANDED IN OHIO! We had to fly to atlanta to spend 1000 dollars on passports and by that time we missed out Cruise in Rome! 2. Decided to try them again. Stupid stupid..I was flying to Wisconsin from Philadelphia and needed to change my departure destination to San Diego. Okay, southwest would allow this. I even figured okay ill change the flight and just pay the difference. How about a change flight is 200 dollars! So I couldn't cancel it because I would lose 288 but if I changed it I would have 88 dollar credit! Are you people insane?! So I had no other option but to change it so I was on the phone and quoted 350 Additional. Dam you Delta. Fine, I told them I would call back in a minute just to confirm with a friend of mine who was flying with me. Called back it went up another 200 dollars! They don't be sorry but no can do! So I ended up paying almost 700 dollars for one coach seat. 3. Coming home from this trip they delayed my plane 4 times so I ended up waiting 4 1/2 hours in the airport. When I asked them what where they gonna do for me they gave me 7 dollar food voucher and said sorry. ARE YOU KIDDING ME???? WILL NEVER EVER FLY WITH THIS COMPANY AGAIN!! HORRIBLE DON'T DO IT!!!~~#~0
Don't even bother. This place is a ghost town with less than bright servers.~~#~0
I use this location since it is so close to work. However,  I will no longer be using this location any longer. I have given the store many chances to make up for slow service.I typically use the drive thru. I always have a long wait, Friday was the last time I was there and I waited for 10 minutes. I will use the coffee shop across the street (Dunkin Donuts) for now on. The coffee is just as good and they are extremely fast.~~#~0
Skip this place http://www.redmountainteaparty.com/actionitems/517meeting.htmlDisgusting~~#~0
I really want to love this place, the music, the location, the ambiance ...But for the five stars I really want to give them, they themselves take those much prized awards away. Here's another wannabe biker bar that won't allow colors in. strike one. The very poor customer service they continually have. strike two. The cockroaches in the bathroom and the condition of them. strike three.I'm a semi-regular (like once a week, that's over fifty times per year) and I still cannot give them any praise except that's it's cheap (sometimes, when they're not over charging/over ringing) and it's a good place to hideout for a while and replay some old music no else has...and to people watch, it's amazing what walks though these doors here.~~#~0
I had the worst customer service experience that I have ever had at this Hertz location. I don't use credit cards and they pull a credit report that is not a soft pull and has an effect on your credit if you use Debit. They put a hold on $225 but did not tell me until after they had done it. The woman assured me that as soon as I returned the car it would be put back onto my card. (the money is still not back on my card two days later) This resulted in my not having access to my funds for Christmas weekend. I picked 10am as a return time not realizing that they don't open until 12 noon. I assumed that dropping the car off when they opened was fine especially considering the receipt warns that if you use the drop box and just leave the car you are responsible for any damages to the vehicle until they can inspect the car. I arrived 5 minutes early and was the first person there. The woman took the keys and then gave me a receipt. I glanced at it to make sure the totals were right and realized she had charged me for an extra day. I asked why and she said it was because I had not dropped the car off at 10am. I asked to speak with a manager because charging for an entire day when they were not even open is insanity. She refused to let me speak with a manager, she refused to give me a corporate number, and she refused to call a manager for me. She said somebody would call me the next day. This was over 24 hours ago and I have not received a phone call.The outright rude behavior, assault to my credit, bank hold, and charging me an extra day when I did not have the car for that day all adds up to a horrible experience. I will never use this company or this location again and I highly recommend that you think twice before using their services. I was not the only person in their rental office that was unhappy with my service or the company policies.~~#~0
We were excited to see a Chinese place close to our house since we love Chinese food.  When we walked in it looked like a nice place and very open.  The service was fine, but when we got our food that was another story.  I ordered the Chow Mien and my wife got the Orange Chicken.  The chow mien was pretty bad it was very greasy and just didn't  seem right.  My wife said her Orange Chicken was alright but she said she wouldn't order again.  We didn't think too bad of the place when we left, but that night we were both sick to our stomaches.  We have no desire to go back.~~#~0
When my wife gets nostalgic for those good ol' high school days, she always mentions that Serrano's was a frequent hang out with friends. She recalls the great bean dip and the tasty enchiladas as her meal of choice. Well, after the eventual buildup of wonderful Mexican food, it really is a disappointment to find such memories are best left in the past.My wife and I went to dinner here when we first moved down to the Tempe area. It was a week day during the lunch hours. It's a dark lit restaurant for "cosy" evenings (as one of my fellow reviewers mentions). No complaints on the service side of things, but no standouts either. When service is just fine, I typically don't come back because I know there might be something better on the other side of town. When it comes to the food, I'll give some credit to the bean dip. However, seeing as an appetizer was the most enjoyable item eaten that night, you won't hear another compliment from me. The food I had heard so much about was bland, boring and down right meh. Don't expect to see me hanging around this restaurant as I'll be spending my money on good Mexican food.~~#~0
I teetered between 1 and 2 stars...I'm not sure what turned me off more: the guy (the cook, the owner? one in the same) who greeted me at the door in a white tee-shirt and sprouting chest hair (ala Simon Cowell, but decidedly NOT the pec-proud Idol Judge), the wobbly chair I was worried might break at any second, or the fact that it took more than 10 minutes to receive our drinks!Not a good start, to say the least.The pizza my friend ordered (the "Greek") was cold and "uninspired" and my calzone's crust was equally cold and bland--absolutely NO FLAVOR to the crust that supposedly cooks in a wood-fired oven, No burn marks, no crispness, nothing even approaching my favorite calzone from Cibo or Bianco in Downtown Phoenix.Unfortunately, the prices were as high as those other establishments, which seals the coffin on this place for me. Put it in the ground and bury it!~~#~0
Have to agree; probably the worst place for "seafood" around. And the corporate atmosphere reminds me of outback or chilis.... enough said.~~#~0
I was absolutely horrified with the "service" here.IFirst of all, the posted hours are different from the ones listed on the website... No biggie.I walked in and asked if I could get a dress altered, she said "Ya" but didn't move from her seat behind the counter.  I  asked, "Um... Like, today?" Again, "Ya," and then nothing.  So, again, I stood there (confused) for a moment. Then she pointed at the fitting room and said "Go."After she put me in front of the mirror, marked my dress, she actually started insulting my skin (I have a few scars on my shoulders, she says "Whats wrong with your skin? Whats wrong with you?" And started to poked at me!).I get changed again, she takes my dress into the back and she tells me to fill out my ticket.  I asked how much and she says "$65"  I said "Wow, why so much?" and here's where she went wacky:She immediately starts chewing on her bottom lip (weird, creepy...), went into the back, snatched up my dress, ironed off the marks she had made, brought it back up front, THREW IT AT ME, picked up my ticket off the counter and tore it up into a bunch of tiny pieces -- Without saying a single word, without even looking in my direction.I have never been treated so poorly in any business ever.  If she's the owner, I'm shocked that she's still in business and if she's an employee, I'm shocked she still has a job.~~#~0
Bug in my veggie sandwich from the bar :(~~#~0
I find out that Saturn has stopped making Roof Racks for my 2003 Saturn Vue which means I cannot get a Roof Rack for my Bikes for road trips, bummer deal. Then I remember how hitch racks have gotten really awesome and that I can get a hitch installed. Well who do you go to for a hitch installation? Google results show that Uhaul is the masters of the hitch install and that being that I call Uhaul. This is where the fun begins, and by fun I mean something akin to stabbing my eyes with a pencil.There is a Uhaul, to my chagrin, very close to my house, so I figure it will be most convenient to call them. After numerous rings I get to talk with Robin. It doesn't sound like Robin is having the best of days, or years, or perhaps longer. I tell her that I would like a hitch installed on my car and we go through the make model year routine to determine what I need installed. She wants to know where I want this done, which is an odd question since I called a specific location. We get through that and she gives me the price of $179.95 for parts, labor, and warranty. She lets me know that it may be more depending on how the wiring configuration is done but I let her know that I will not need that since I am putting a bike rack on and that will be it for the foreseable future. I get a confirmation number and she emails me the receipt. I am also told that someone will contact me to setup the appointment. This is June 10th.On June 12th, Friday, I still have not received a call so I decide to give the Uhaul location a call back to see whats up with the appointment. I offer my confirmation number but the gentleman just wants my name. He says that the appointment is set up for Wednesday June 17th. I am surprised by this since no one ever called to set that up. I ask if we can get it done on Monday June 15th instead. The gentleman says yes that will be fine and to bring it in at 8am and that it should only take 30 minutes. I enter this into my calendar and go about my weekend.June 15th rolls around and I go to the Uhaul for my scheduled appointment for the hitch installation. I am greeted by a gentleman walking away from me to talk with another Uhaul employee, or rather Manager/Owner James Flake. After an awkward minute of me standing at the counter 5 feet away from these two gentlemen talking about their work I finally am greeted by the younger one. I let him know that I am here for my scheduled hitch install which causes him to look over my shoulder to James and laugh. He then lets me know that James will be doing the install. I ask if I should bring the car around back and he thinks this is a good plan.As I pull around I see another customer waiting on James and can see that things are going to be moving slowly today. I wait in my car for 10 minutes until James comes up and asks if I know that this appointment is set for Wednesday. I tell him that yes I am aware that originally it was set for that that but that I had called on Friday to reschedule. He lets me know that its going to take a while as he has deliveries to take care of but that I will be his priority. I am okay with this since I have brought my book along and have no appointments till the afternoon.10am rolls around and James Flake comes in to let me know its all done. We saddle up to the register and he tells me the total is ~$220 which I inform him is incorrect. I tell him that the total parts, labor, and warranty was quoted to me as $179.95. He snickers at me and wants to know who told me that. I explain that it was Robin to which he responds that Robin does not work there. I let him know that it is irrelevant as I was quoted $179.95 and that is what I will be paying. Another Uhaul employee comes over to see what the fuss is about and they start discussing that I was quoted the online price for the hitch which is cheaper than their price. I stand and say nothing to this.James is still not willing to offer the price I was quoted so he lets me know that he can take the hitch off. I let him know he is welcome to do so. He then tells me that I will have to wait since he has other customers. This cracks me up because there is nothing better for your other customers than to have one who you are trying to Bait and Switch standing in your store raising hell.Another Uhaul employee comes over and his name tag says owner as well. By this time I have found the email and let them see it. They agree to honor the price and I am on my way.Clearly Uhaul has some communication issues between its stores and the central call center that my initial call was routed to. The first issue this caused was that I never got a call back for when the installation would occur. Second when I called to setup the installation time I talked with the store where I was apparently talking to someone too busy to actually write down the appointment that we set up. Third was the price issue.~~#~0
Zero stars. Close early and are not accommodating to hungry and hopeful pho fans.  This place closes at 8:30pm on a saturday and so I called in "anticipation" at 8:00p to my surprise they told me not to come in because they were closing!!  I was so upset! Still am!! I dont recommend this place because of some very terrible customer service.  Hmph!~~#~0
I have been to this place a couple of times for business lunches and had never been disappointed with food or service until tonight.Food 2/5We had the thai hummus and southwest burger. The hummus is actually very nice. Has a nice kick to it and you take taste the peanut sauce but its not overwhelming. The pita however was very soggy and felt like it came straight out of a microwave. The southwest burger was good, nothing more and nothing less. I did expect more 'southwest flavor' though.Service 1/5About 2 minutes after our appetizer was brought out the server brought our entree's  'Sorry, your server put in two different tickets' was his reaction when he noticed that we had just begun eating the appetizer. When we asked our waitress she said 'its so quiet tonight that they're just really fast bringing out the food.'  When I notified the waitress that the fries were luke warm and that I was not happy with the whole situation she looked at us with a 'wow, I really dont care. wtf are you complaining about' attitude and asked us what we would like her to do. I guess it was too much to ask of her to just fix the situation. We ended up eating our appetizer as dessert -after- our entree since the entree itself wasnt warm to begin with and didnt want it to cool any further while we ate our appetizers. Then, when we *after* were finished another server brought new fries -which we did not ask for and sent back to the kitchen- ???To top it off, our server must have noticed that we already had dessert in the form of appetizers and dropped the check at our table without asking whether we wanted dessert. And yes, you've guessed it, everything was on there we paid full price for very poor service and mediocre food.The beer was good though but thankfully you can get that at a dozen other places throughout the valley.~~#~0
I've never had a bad experience at this location until now. We walked in, waited with 2 other families for too long while all the employees ignored us. And when the hostess finally showed up, she looked like she'd rather have bamboo sticks stuck under her fingernails than seat us. Forget it! I had a bad feeling about how our meal would turn out, so we left.~~#~0
Sadly, we were unimpressed with Maria Maria at Tempe Marketplace. We were there at about 2pm on a Sunday, so we figured we'd have the whole place to ourselves, which we did, and unfortunately, that included the wait staff. Service was terrible, it took 10 mins for someone to show up at our table, we ordered drinks and water and the water never came. We ordered the baked cheese appetizer and they brought it out with no warm tortillas. We searched for our waitress or the waitress that brought out the dip, but no one was around, for at least 10 minutes. The table next to us also had no attention. We decided then that we weren't going to finish our meal there. The chips and salsa they brought out was fine, they had a couple of hot salsas that were good. I'm a fan of all things tomatillo, so it was good to have that option on the table. Back to the baked cheese with chicken, chorizo and ham. It was OK, but was difficult to eat with only chips. Also, it had a strong cinnamon flavor in it and that wasn't appealing to us. I have read a couple of reviews regarding the cinnamon in some of their dishes. I get that they are trying to put their spin on the food, but like I said, it didn't work well. So, we ended up leaving and going to our favorite Mexican dive called Armando's on McKlintock and Guad. I will now be writing a glowing review for them!~~#~0
Three weeks ago I went through the cig line with my groceries and was literally sent to another line for the purchase because at THIS Walmart you apparently are not allowed to purchase cigs unless you are purchasing less than 10 items at that register.  Isn't the point behind shopping at Walmart that you are supposed to be able to use it as a one stop shopping source?  I have never encountered this nonsensical approach to customer service.....punish the customer for buying too many of your products along with limiting your cig sales??I also have to report that yesterday my husband and I stopped by to purchase a few items, which included a case of Heineken, and as our items were being rung into the register, the cashier asked for an ID, which I provided, and after glancing at it, she told me that it was corporate policy to ask for all ID's of those in line in order to purchase alcohol.  My husband and I were puzzled and of course he provided identification as we are both in our mid thirties, but I requested to speak with a manager as I know this is NOT corporate policy.  The way my husband and I were subsequently treated by the csm Sindy was unbelievably insulting which of course resulted in my request for the store manager, to which she responded...., HE'LL be here in a minute, the store manager is a female, so obviously she felt like she didn't want the store manager to be contacted in regard to the treatment we recieved.  I spoke with an assistant store manager who told me that it was state law and corporate policy to check everyone's ID who happens to be in line with you when purchasing alcohol or tobacco.  I asked him...., what about if there is a child present?  If it were myself and a child...., would I be turned down for said purchase?  He stated....of course not, we wouldn't ask for ID's for children or teenagers......  Sooooooo, which is it?  You have to ask for ID's from everyone in line or not?  Or just from the adults that are obviously of age?  I spoke with corporate directly and they have begged forgiveness for how we were treated and assured me that this is absolutely NOT their policy and that I will be contacted within a week with a formal apology from the store manager.I also contacted the DLLC and had the statements regarding state laws disproved, there are no laws whatsoever in AZ that require everyone standing near you to show ID for an alcohol purchase.I recieved a phone call at 9:30pm last night from an assistant manager from this location asking me what the problem was?  I asked why in the world I was receiving a call after 9pm from anyone there, and why the store manager was not following through as corporate assured me she would be required to do.  He stated...., I do all the same things that she does, so I don't see why you wouldn't talk to me?  Well, let's see, shall we begin with the fact that you chose to call a customer in the middle of the night??  Is that a new corporate policy?  I let him know that I will be expecting a call from the store manager today. I said all of that to say this...., my husband is a minority, a 100% disabled veteran minority, and it was painfully obvious through this ENTIRE process as to why he had been singled out for his ID after I had already presented my valid DL.  We immediately went to customer service after our purchase yesterday morning and returned the entire cart.  We will not be Walmart supporters any longer, and I would request that anyone that supports our military, whether active duty or disabled veteran, or anyone who is a minority or loves one as much as I do, boycott at least THIS location in order for this store manager to see that we ALL deserve to be treated with respect and dignity, that customer service DOES matter and that ignoring issues that are presented to her along with her staff making lame excuses based on outright lies to cover racism will not be tolerated.~~#~0
Terrible service. Went here with my family an I ordered a gyro. The pita bread was more like calzone bread, barely any sauce, 2 tomatoes, and disgusting red onion. I asked the waiter to take it off the bill, which he did, but he gave me major attitude. If I had not been with my grandparents I would have probably got in a verbal altertcation with him. But I guess I have to feel bad for the kid, being a waiter in fountain hills. Anyways stay clear of this place.~~#~0

There are some mighty fine BBQ joints in the Phoenix area - This ain't one of them.The good: The people were friendly and helpful. The restaurant is laid out nicely and clean. The selection of side dishes is good. Tasty rolls. They carry Big Red soda.The So-So: The ribs, what a shame. The texture and taste seem to indicate they were steamed or boiled. They are fall of the bone soft, but lack anything resembling flavor. My spare ribs had a ton of cartilage.The BBQ sauce was not bad, not inspired, but certainly better than the ribs they were on. The potato salad did more of a service to the BBQ sauce than the ribs.The Bad: The price! $19 for a rack of less than mediocre ribs!I'm not likely to voluntarily return here soon.~~#~0
I really hate to be the person writing this... I've been here a few times and realize it's very over priced. I've always considered it 2 1/2 stars at the best. Most of the posts are VERY over rated. I've been to this facility at least 6 times because bevmo is right next door. I bought a "coupon" from them that is 1/2 off their price but realized that it was expired as of the 1st of the year. I asked them on their FB page if they would still honor it (as they posted a LS and Groupon deal around the same time) and they told me that would be fine. Then they deleted the post and told me that I it would not be accepted. I told them that I would no longer be a customer and they deleted that post as well. Happy deleting. I will NO LONGER GO TO INDULGE ever.~~#~0
Don in electronics is the rudest costco employee I have ever run in to.  I was going to buy laptop but went to Sams Club .~~#~0
OMG this place has the rudest staff I've ever encountered.  I've had the food here a couple of times and they've always been on the abrupt side (and that's being kind) but tonight the woman behind the counter literrally YELLED at me while she was taking my order.  Needless to say I walked out and will NEVER go back.  Nothing is worth rude people.  The reviewer below is also right, they're hit and miss with their food, more miss lately than hit.  Skip this place.~~#~0
I would like to tell you a story about the worst day of my life.  It was when I came to your worthless"bar"  Your overpriced cocktails have the alcohol content of a handi-wipe at best.  I can also conclude that you do not have any sort of benefits offered to your employees because they walk by customers several times and cannot seem to recognize what a customer holding cash looks like.  Send them to an eye doctor.  They are too busy checking their cell phones and showing each other their awful, awful tattoos.  The prisoners in a concentration camps received better service from the Nazis then I got from the employees at your bar.  I had such a bad experience that I feel I will never be able to get an erection ever again, until I hear that your place has gone out of business (I'm sure it will very soon)  The only compliment I have is that I am glad you allow dogs on your patio.  I plan to bring them mine over soon after eating five cans of Hormel chili in the hopes they will piss and s*** all over the place and hopefully maul a member of your useless staff.  If a member of the police force shows up and have been to your dump bar, they will understand and let me go.  I predict your hellhole will soon be turning into a gay bar.P.S. - The food you offer..... wow.  I can't believe you try to pass that kibble off as food.  The health department will be by soon and will close your virtual food "house of horrors" ASAP.  Great food if you are constipated and need to do a little spring cleaning.  If you are bulimic, come eat here.  Guaranteed to make you puke.Looking forward to the day you go out of business.~~#~0
This place was "temporally" closed.  I'm sure they meant temporarily, but based on other reviews things didn't look good for it going in.~~#~0
I'd love to give a half a star but Yelp won't let me. I'd have lived at Roosevelt Square since may 2010, and just recently moved out at the end of September (2012) upon moving out I was hit with a $391 bill for carpet and carpet seal replacement (I'm assuming the padding under the carpet) The only thing they went off is just the manager doing the walk through saying she smelled cat urine (with no real evidence, black light and/or ammonia tests done by a third party) and the funny part is that I've been chain smoking cigarettes in that apartment for two years and there was no mention of her smelling that. The way that Berkshire did this is really just a way to extort money out of you if you're a pet owner. At $30 a month for having a pet and being there for 26 months and paying a $250 'non refundable deposit' I've paid over $1000 I paid to these apartments because I own a cat. That's not including the carpet replacement that I have to pay. Berkshire Properties is obviously out there to manage (and do a horrible job of it, there has been an instance where they LOST MY RENT CHECK and I had to correct one of the office workers on the correct rent amount) but to steal money from you once you move out. It seems like the general consensus with people on yelp and even with people I know personally that vacated these apartmentsPlease understand if you have a pet or animal of some sort and paid that non refundable deposit, YOU WILL PAY FOR THE CARPET no matter what. (using that phrase 'non refundable' and 'deposit' together is misleading because a deposit is money you pay and get back if there is no damage) So basically look at it as money you're giving to them. Walls are paper thin. I've had two noise complaints against me but my upstairs neighborhood could do jumping jacks, and what sounded like roller skating upstairs and no one complained about that because he/she has been doing it up to when i moved outStepping in dog poop on the side walk and walking by the dog waste bins that hasn't been changed out for a while was generally unpleasant, but its not too bad i guess..The only great thing about this place is the location, being close to the 'downtown' area, and light rail. Pita jungle is awesome and Lola's and Fair trade .be prepared to pay some money when you leave is all I'm saying people.~~#~0
Why am I giving Harkins Camelview only 1-star? I will explain why, and these are all very legitimate reasons:1. The people in this town - you know who you are, the ones who complain about how there's no "culture" in this town - who will only go to an "independent" film if it's playing at Harkins Camelview. As if Harkins Camelview is the magical, arbitrary measure against which an "independent" film is judged. Or, even sillier, that "Harkins Camelview" is a genre. Here's a quarter, buy this clue: When someone asks you what kind of movies you like, the correct answer would be: "Drama or Comedy or Documentary or Foreign." You don't say, "Whatever's playing at Camelview." You look like an idiot when you tell people that. And furthermore, you should want to see the movie because you want to see the movie, not because oh, gee, it's playing at Camelview, so, gee, it must be good. And setting aside for a moment that most of Harkins Camelview-worthy "independent" movies they show are in actuality big studio-budgeted niche releases, there's maybe one or two movies at a time that really are "exclusive." (Not to mention "independent.") With a few exceptions, you can see most of the same movies at other Harkins theaters or/and "AMC Select" theaters. You can get the same exact "Harkins Camelview" experience at other theaters. Is it really that big of a deal to see a movie a week ahead of time before it expands into more theaters? Honestly? And I really can't stand the idiots - absolute imbeciles -  who need to be told the film's in subtitles. If you're so dense you can't figure out that a French film is in subtitles, you know what? You probably don't have the I.Q. to be going to movies at the Camelview. Go across the street to the Scottsdale Fashion Square and watch "Paul Blart Mall Cop" over there or something. Please.  2. The theater is tiny, right down to the tiny two-window ticket counter that has people standing outside wrapped around the theater like a pretzel. It's ridiculous. It sucks during the winter, when it's cold. It sucks during the summer, when it's hot. (During the summer, the misters are a joke.) When will Harkins get a bigger ticket window at the box office? 3. The theater lobby itself, once you get inside? Even worse. Packed in like sardines. Barely any room to move around it. By comparison, there is plenty of room to socialize and congregate and roam around at Chandler Cinemas and *other* Harkins theaters. But not at Harkins Camelview. You're herded in and out like cattle. If you like being herded in and out of the theater like you're cattle, you'll love Harkins Camelview. 4. The theaters themselves....get smaller and smaller as you walk down the hallway. It's surreal, when you think about it. There's one big theater, one medium-size theater, and if the movie you want to see isn't in either of those...well, you're screwed. An iPod has a bigger screen than that tiny theater at the end of the hall.5. The "Harkins Camelview" mentality in this town has resulted in less and less diversity - and more and more gentrification - at a time when independent film really shouldn't be centered at a CROWDED SHOPPING MALL WHERE YOU CAN'T EVEN FIND A PARKING SPACE MOST DAYS. The next time you want to see an "independent film," stop and ask yourself: "Did I ever go to the old Madstone Theater before it closed? When was the last time I went to a movie at Chandler Cinemas? And, have I been to any film screenings in downtown Phoenix lately?" If your answers to those questions are no, no, and 'there's independent film in downtown Phoenix?,' congratulations, you're part of the reason people think there's no 'culture' here.My conclusion: Harkins Camelview is *NOT* essential for fans of independent and foreign film. (Was it ever?) Those of you in the East Valley or/and West Valley who think you're missing out...you're not missing a thing. You can have the exact same "Harkins Camelview" experience at other Harkins Theaters or/and at "AMC Select" theaters. Save yourself the stress and aggravation and only go to Harkins Camelview if it absolutely, positively isn't showing anywhere else.~~#~0
I love the Bahama Bucks product and have been a Bahama Bucks customer for years and years. We always went to the location on Mill Ave and 3rd St when I was growing up, and it has always been a favorite for me. Lately though I have been going to the Warner and Rural location and the service is horrendous. One Wednesday I went with my wife, our 2 nephews, 2 nieces, and their mother (my sister). The same blonde girl that has given us bad service in the past was working, along with a brunette. We didn't interact much with the brunette, but the blonde was attitudinal as usual. EVERYTHING seems to be a chore for her. Any sort of request from a customer is a HUGE inconvenience, maybe because it distracts her from the important task of gossiping with her coworker and twittering about how she hates customers. This girl makes absolutely no attempt to disguise her total lack of interest in helping customers. Even a request from my 7 year old nephew for some extra napkins was met with a short, attitude filled response. Then the same girl went and turned off the "Open" sign and informed us -with attitude of course -that they were closing, obviously implying that she wanted us to leave. It was only 9:50, and they are supposed to close at 10. I understand that it can be hard to get top notch workers for a job like this, but with these girls they are really scraping the bottom of the barrel. In-n-Out manages to employ workers that at least feign a sense of interest in their job, and so do many of the yogurt places in the area. My wife and I have avoided Bahama Bucks a few times because of not wanting to deal with the self-centered, under-interested, acne faced, attitude filled, teeny boppers that they currently employ. We look forward to the day that these girls graduate high school and move on to their life long careers of cutting hair at Super-Cuts and spawning illegitimate, undisciplined children who will receive just as little of their attention as a Bahama Bucks customer. Sorry to be so straight forward but please either give these girls some Valium, or hire someone with an interest in LIFE.I give the product 4 stars, but the staff only 1 star.~~#~0
The service is absolutely terrible.  I called early in the morning and scheduled an appointment. Betsy said he would be there between 1-5 pm. I called at 4:30 pm to see if he was on his way and she said she would check and call me right back. After 20 minutes I called again and Betsy advised me that the plumber was in Chandler and the other one in Gilbert and they were all too far away from Scottsdale, so it probably won't happen.  Absolutely the worst service ever!! I called another plumber and he was able to make it in an hour the same day and cleared the line, so we could finally flush the toilet. If you need a plumber, don't bother calling Sun Devil Plumbing.~~#~0
First time here to watch some live music (co-workers of mine). This bar does not approve of alternative lifestyles. I was kissing my girlfriend, not pronographic stuff going on, simply kissing and we were told by a waitress named Ash to "cool it".I will NEVER go back. I have never been absurd or inappropriate in public and for them to come out and tell us to "cool it", because someone's wife complained...this is not okay.I will definitely spread the word through my industry.~~#~0
This Hotel is very POORLY managed.  They charged my three night stay to the wrong person, although they gave me a reciept for my stay.  They constantly  told two different stories to me and the wrongly charged person.  To resolve the error, they took my credit card information and then four days later said that they never spoke with me and don't know who I could have spoken to or where my credit card information is. It took two months to resolve this issue and they were not really concerned that they were mismanaging sensitive information and improperly charging individuals for hotel stays.  I feel sorry for the guest who was improperly charged for my stay!~~#~0
Two stars for food, no stars for Service = one star.~~#~0
Too bad there's not an option for no stars. The only thing more atrocious than the fungal smell and lack of working equipment at this gym is the customer service. Today I cancelled my entire family's membership because I've had enough. After touring three other local gyms - I'm willing to pay the extra money to switch to one that gives a crap about its customers. Having had my membership for 11 years it's a sad move, especially since I pay peanuts - but it's just NOT worth the headache of working out here. When the manager accused me of lying about my child's age, I went back home and brought back her birth certificate to prove I wasn't lying, and still I remained a customer. When the manager bitched at me about not answering the overhead page when it CLEARLY states on the app (in permanent marker) that they MUST call me on my cellular because I am hard of hearing and I run plugged into my iPhone, I stayed a member. Now they're saying I haven't paid up my account even though I have a RECEIPT in my possession from last week, when I paid in person. If this is how they treat loyalty, I'd hate to see how they piss on everyone else. Take my advice - pay the extra few bucks and switch to Gold's, LA, or ANYWHERE else.~~#~0
I went to Deluxe Dry Cleaners yesterday to drop off some clothes to get clean before heading to LA for New Years and as the sign says $1.95 Cleaners that is for two day service.  If you want it in by 9 and out by 5 you have to pay an extra $.50 per item.  This alone was frustrating because they don't mention this until you walk in.  So I pay the fee and drop off my clothing.  I forgot to pick them up after I left work yesterday so I stop in this morning.  I come to find out the main piece I went to the cleaners for (my blazer) was not at their location.  They sent it out to get cleaned and it didn't make it back.  So as you can imagine I'm not very happy.  She stated oh it will be here first thing in the morning.  I told her that is not an option as I leave for LA in the morning and this is way out of my way.  So supposedly it will be there at 6pm when I get off work.  We will see.  As of now the best they could get was a 1 star so I reviewed it accordingly.  STAY AWAY STAY FAR AWAYUpdate:  I picked up my blazer and they ruined most of the buttons on it.  I am very upset as I received it on Christmas and it was getting cleaned to wear the first time.  I will update again after I go talk to the manager.New Update:  Talked with the manager and they told me they aren't responsible for the manufacturer's buttons on the coat.  They said it is a risk dry cleaning anything because it may get damaged from the chemicals.  I couldn't believe it and will never go back if I could give a 0 star I would.  BBB will be getting a complaint for this place.~~#~0
Beware!  I took my 7 yr old golden there 3 TIMES stating that my golden was achey and had a stiff neck...keep in mind that this is a dog who has accummulated many, many medals from numerous 1/2 marthons and has never had so much as a limp.  All 3 TIMES Dr. Howard never took a blood test!  After the 3rd visit, I was called home as my dog had 8 cluster seizures!  What from?  Valley Fever!   Half of ALL dogs in the valley will come down with Valley Fever and MOST vets, I have taked to since, would have checkd for this before anythiing else as the symptoms are so blatant.If Howard had done a blood test and found the valley fever at the one of the first two vists, John could've been prescribed the proper meds and avoided the seizures NOT to mentoon the THOUSANDS of dollars spent at the Veterinary Neurologice Center of Phoenix (thank God for Dr. Knowles).Grayhawk never returned any of my calls, my dog went thru pure hell and the vet bills have cost us thousands!  And why?  We just heard that Dr. Howard wasn't "on  his game" as he was going thru a divorce.Way to go Dr. Howard..you should've relegated John to another vet if you "weren't on your game"!~~#~0
Headed here for lunch since they're only open til 4.  Had coworkers who liked the place and I love gyros, so thought we'd give it a try.  The customer service was meh but the place was clean so thats a plus.  We each got a gyro and fries.  The fries weren't anything special but hot and greasy.  The gyro meat was not delicious.  It was really greasy and dry at the same time.  I didn't think it could be both.  I coudln't even finish my gyro it was that bad.  Needless to say, we won't be here again.~~#~0
Place smells very very musky-mildewy. I should have left when I smelled the place. I ordered their "house chicken" - it was basically overcooked fried chicken in a very watered down teriyaki sauce - I ate two bites and asked for the check. Husband ordered beef with broccoli - it was cold. Don't waste your time. Go to Great Wok instead for great take out.~~#~0
Shame on me.  Twice I have ordered to go and theyve have always forgot something~~#~0
Very disappointing experience... we get here at 5pm... party of 3... and you refuse to seat us because there are going to be 2 large parties later!?!?! There were 5 open tables, this is completely unacceptable!!!~~#~0
I managed to convince myself to drive the 15 minutes to this Mcdonalds, as it was one of few open at 1 am.  I ordered a coke, drove home (30 min round trip plus wait in line) and discovered to my dismay that I had been given a Dr. Pepper. I hate Dr. Pepper, threw it away.  This is not the first time I have been disappointed in this store.  On several occasions on late night visits they have not been able to accept debit.  Another time I received diet coke.  The next time I feel like a late night snack Im going to Wendys.~~#~0
Avoid this place unless u like "hairy" over priced burgers. After waiting for around 40 mins, we finally got our burgers. My GF found a pube like thick hair attached to the side of her $18 burger. We pretty much got grossed out and had to leave. I only had taken a single bit out of mine but still had to pay almost $20 before it was all said and done... I recommend five guys burgers instead..~~#~0
Well this is not new york pizza and obviously no one here has ever had NY pizza.  Sauce bland, crust was wrong and cheese had an odd flavor.  Don't say its new york pizza if its not.  Just another sub-standard pizza place trying to make a buck off the new york name.~~#~0
If it wasn't for the high prices, I'd probably give this place 2 stars.  I went with 2 other people, and we did not order liquor, just an appetizer, and 3 dishes, and we walked out of there disappointed, and spent $140.NOTE: I was facing the kitchen and could see the chef.  For a place that charges $20-35 per plate, you'd expect the pasta to be cooked to order (only takes 10-11 minutes!).  However, the pasta was precooked, but heated up in a pan with the sauces to order.  Any pasta dish from Cheese Cake factory is way better than anything on this menu -- and half price. For the appetizer, we got 4 scallops. Scallops were smaller than we expected on a bed of pesto.  They were alright, nothing special.We then ordered 3 dishes, Osso Buco (special), Linguine with sea food combo, and chicken marsala with linguine.Osso Buco - this was a $35 item, so we had high expectations.  It came on a bed of risotto.  I could see the chef cook from where I was sitting.  The risotto had to be scrapped off the pan, and it was noticeably dry.  The beef was not tender, and clearly needed to be cooked more.  If you've had osso buco anywhere decent, you know it's supposed to almost fall off the bone.Chicken Marsala had no flavor.  I thought there wasn't enough sauce, so I asked for more sauce, but the sauce was very thin and watery, and just lacked flavor.  The 3rd dish was also OK -- probably the better out of the three.We won't be back.~~#~0
Except the car is in good sharp, there is no customer service.  When I was at different lane to get out, the AVIS associates was sitting at the gate without walk to my lane and check me out.  Instead, I have to back the car, move to the lane they were sat.  Speak with horrible tone and rude.  Moreover, they said if I pass 1 min of my return time, they will charge me for a extra day.  Avoid AVIS, Hertz gave me much better experiences.~~#~0
I have to agree with the other reviewers on their views of this pizza hut. It's a real shame because a real pizza hut where that you can actually sit down and enjoy a pizza with your family is becoming a rare thing indeed. Many of them have converted to the take out/delivery only format. I was thrilled to see a sit down pizza hut in Casa Grande. Unfortunately the service quickly tamed any excitement I was feeling over the location and style of the restaurant. Every time we eat here we are greeted by consistant rude and unprofessional service. My wife is a huge fan of pizza hut so we deal with the terrible service because we have to...it's the only pizza hut in town. If it was up to me we would stick to T and M pizza all the time and ignore this establishment entirely.~~#~0
Got a two year contract with AT&T and bought an iPhone. Told them I was moving to northern Illinois and needed nationwide plan and specifically asked if they were sure I would have coverage where I was moving. They assured me I would have coverage. After moving, found there was no coverage in my area. I had to switch to Verizon and buy a new iPhone again. AT&T charged me $225.00 for early termination fee. I told them I thought they should wave it, since they told me incorrectly that I would have coverage here. The lady manager just got snooty with me, interrupted me, and said they would take me to collections if I didn't agree to pay their termination fee.I would never ever use AT&T again, as they lied to me.~~#~0
Look, let's face it, Maggie Moo. You never even stood a chance.Your flavors are pedantic and unimaginative, your service is lackluster and disheartening, and your prices defy logic.It's fucking ice cream, and not even good ice cream. I wouldn't know. Maybe if you took better care maintaining your merchandise, it wouldn't taste so terrible.Whether the flavor's "too soft" or "too hard" it requires you take the reserve tray out of the freezer and serve some of that to me instead. So apparently your display case is just that. Display.Your mix-ins are lame and stale. M&M's and sprinkles? Gee, don't give yourself a fucking aneurysm with all this creativity. So you really didn't have much going for you already by the time your cashier called me "sir". TWICE. The second time was my fault though. I tried to intervene and correct her."is that all for you, sir?""Um...it's ma'am, actually. I'm a girl.""Oh. I'm sorry, sir!"If I hadn't said anything I would've only been offended the one time. Mea culpa.It's not entirely that girl's fault I'm giving you one star, but it certainly helped convince.You'd be well informed to know I'm writing a letter. Not to your manager or anything. But to Coldstone Creamery. Begging them back.I figure why be with a knock-off of a piece of garbage when I can just be with the real deal, you know.Ha ha! Who am I kidding. This one event will probably deter me from ice cream all together. I'll need to set "Gelato & Frozen Custard" on the "Ice Cream Orientation" box on all my social profiles.~~#~0
Really don't know why I come here.  Rude and unfriendly service every time, especially the older short heavy lady.  This place needs to go out of business to make room for a better joint.~~#~0
i really wanted to like this place, i really did. Its a Friday and we expected it to be busy, but aside from one large party, there were many empty tables. We sat down and were more than a little surprised when we had to wait for the waitress to walk by us four times and start setting the empty tables before the bar tender came over to give us menus. We went simple: beef tacos and enchiladas. Honest to goodness, taco bell beat these tacos. They had hardly anything in them. I'm sorry, but if I wanted to eat an empty taco shell I could have done that at home. The enchilada sauce was unimpressive at best.What really got the raised eyebrow was the $26.00 check. No drinks, no appetizers. Just one terrible taco plate and one mediocre enchilada plate. We won't be going back.~~#~0
serously my son and I had the chipote steak, it was so salty I couildn't eat it.  yuk~~#~0
$10 for a beer!?!  Seriously?  They should be ashamed.  And I thought $6 for a bottle of Bud Light at The Marquee was ridiculousHere's some math for you, A-hole Airways Center . . . at Chase Field during a D'backs game a couple weeks ago I had eight $4 beers totaling $32.  At the Rush show at your venue tonight, because of your insane pricing, I had zero $10 beers totaling $0.Don't spend that $0.00 all in one place, douche bags~~#~0
Asian buffets scare me... I usually don't know what half the stuff is, and if I do know what it is, it's a microwaved crazy sauced version of what I'm used to. Granted, I came here with a hungry hoard of UCSD dragon boaters, so we were all starved from a long day of paddling. Yes, I ate, but I was terrified that everyone would be sitting on a toilet for the rest of the night and that we would be totally unable to paddle our races the next day.Microwavable edamame was my friend since I saw the costco sized bags sitting on the side (I figured I'd be safe with these), and I attempted to try everything else like the random seafoods, mushy sushi, and fatty meats. Their desserts were weird generic cakes that seemed to be salvaged from the sale section of the local grocery bakery, so I stuck with the frozen yogurt.Lots of better options out there, but I guess since there were about 50 of us, we were limited.~~#~0
We went to the Breakfast Joynt this morning.  We had been there before to use a groupon, and today we were using a Travelzoo deal.  The host was friendly enough, but our waitress was very distracted.  While she took our drink and food order quickly enough, the follow-up was lacking. She did check up on us part of the way through the meal, asking if she could bring us water.  We told her that this would be great.  However, 15 minutes went by with no water.  We finished our meal and sat there, watching her take care of another table near us.  Every time we tried to get her attention, she just walked by.  She finally noticed that we were done, but rather than ask if she could bring us anything, or even bring us the water she had offered earlier, she put the check on the table and walked away.  The food was ok, but the service was very disappointing. On our previous visit, we had found the service to be lacking, but not nearly as bad as it was this time.  If you do decide to eat here, I would recommend a significant amount of patience.~~#~0
Owners were friendly.  Wanted to support local business.  Bought over $1000 worth of bike from them.  Less than 6 weeks later structural defect with frame rendered bike unusable.  Defect was covered under manufacturer's warranty. Store had a replacement part in-house, but insisted we wait "a week or so" for replacement part from manufacturer.  3 weeks and a lot of bus fare later - part still not in.  Discovered that they had not even called manufacturer to check on the hold up with the part.  Hassled them until they agreed to replace with in-house part which was still sitting there.1 month later rear wheel "out of true" for second time in 4 weeks, reluctantly returned to store to discuss issue with them.  3 month old wheels should not fall apart particularly on a strictly pavement road bike.  Accused us of mis-use and refused to offer any recourse outside of selling us a new wheel.Too many other shops in the area to have to deal with this kind of stuff.  Hate resorting to chains but at least they will honor their warranties.~~#~0
I try to avoid this airport at all costs while connecting to other destinations.  The terminals have no tram or train and are VERY far apart from each other.  On more than one occasion the people-movers have been down for repair which makes that feature even more annoying.The bathrooms have this hallway that is only wide enough for ONE person to fit through which makes going through with bags entertaining; especially when a flight arrives and the area is crowded with passengers rushing to the restrooms.  Yes, that's "one person" for both directions.Then to add to the fun there was a last minute gate change AND it took them 20 minutes to get the jet-way to the plane.  Good times.~~#~0
One of the worst dining experiences of my life.  We came in one night with a Groupon and I was very excited to try a new Thai restaurant considering my thai food experiences in Tempe, Gilbert, and Phoenix so far had been very very good.  Well I guess coming in with a Groupon makes you a criminal.  At least that's how we were treated.The tom yum soup we had was 99% liquid with not much in the way of substance.  It also did not taste like the tom yum soup I grew up with or have had at other restaurants.  It was "different" but not in a good way.My fiance and I are Asian, we may know a thing or two about Thai/Vietnamese/Cambodian/Chinese food.  Well apparently we don't because when we complained our papaya salad tasted like chemicals the owner relayed the message to our server that we could not substitute it for something else.  You read that right, the owner relayed the message to our server.  Not once did we get the pleasure of meeting the owner of this awful establishment.I don't even remember what we ordered as an entree; in my mind I was still in shock over what had transpired with the papaya salad.If I recall we even asked if we could order desert, no joke they refused to even let us order it.  Bear in min this was for cash money dollars over the value of the groupon.Suffice to say I have probably already told 20 people to avoid this place like the plague. This place really needs go out of business.~~#~0
If you love being ignored and treated rudely, this is the place for you. There are too many other local restaurants in town to put up with the bad service. if you are not a regular, forget it. We had to get our own menus, go to the counter for refills and condiments.....never an apology. Yes, we have been there more than once - guess we were hoping something would change. Food is average. Don't expect to get what you order - once I ordered chorizo and got taco meat. ( I know the difference.) A group of us go out to lunch every week. Not one person ever suggests the Cook E Jar.~~#~0
Horrible service!  It took them forever to answer the phone so I could place my To Go order.  When I took my food order home, it was incorrect.  So I called the restaurant only to be put on hold for 15min, with employees picking up the line on occasion to ask me to hold longer.  When I asked for the manager I was hung up on.  After another 5min. wait back on hold, I was finally able to speak to the manager.  He was nice enough to refund the price of the entree that was incorrect, however, I would still not recommend this location.  I have been to other Pei Wei locations in the Valley with much better service.~~#~0
So, I read the great reviews on Yelp and when a friend suggested going here I was all over it!  Yes, let's go do Vintage!  So we get to Hollywood Regency Vintage and are overwhelmed with the selection of really cool vintage items.  There was an excellent selection of vintage jewelry and cool things rarely seen elsewhere like lipstick holders and little tin containers to "hide" hairspray under....and I was impressed.  The woman who is the owner seemed very helpful and friendly....however, upon commenting on a gorgeous dress in the back room, the sales associate working said to us "Yes, you think Prom with that one....but I had a woman 'OF A CERTAIN AGE' try it on and she looked pretty good in it too."  (She exaggerated it and meant OLD!)Then she turns to my friend who is one of the youngest looking,  beautiful women I know , (who looked about the same age as this sales associate)  and says: "I think you might look nice in it as you are about the same age she was."Really?  Really?  She said that?  About a customer??? Did she forget in less than a minute that she called the other customer ancient? (she was dressed like a fifties Lucille Ball and maybe that kind of thing was said in the 50's??So my friend looks at me and says in the nicest way:  "So, I think I'M done here, you?"  And we left.  I have worked in customer service and retail management for years and have never heard such a thing said to a customer.  WOW!~Needless to say I will NOT be back.Really?~~#~0
I took my car in for a $50 oil change. Combs Auto Repair inspected it and told me I needed $2,312.61 in repairs; including rear brakes, air filter, head light service, transmission flush, battery, and engine mounts. I guess they did not realize I had just purchased my battery within a year and had replaced two of the engine mounts they said needed repairs. I took my car to another well known and respected repair shop and paid for an inspection. They said it did not need any of the above items Combs Auto Repair said I needed. It is unfortunate that Combs Auto Repair can't be trusted. I still need a good repair shop in North Scottsdale.~~#~0
No parking!!!!  Unfriendly staff except bartender.  He was trying but quite marginal.OMG!!!!!  1 HOUR AND 35 MINUTES OF WAITING AND $120 BAR TAB? REALLY???  Not our first time, gave this place chances after chances before writing it off.  The hostess kept telling us 20 minutes, after 20 minutes went by, another 15-20 minutes, etc.  We saw people that just walked in get seated before us!  Wasn't greeted when we entered, not even a "Hi, can I help you?"Wait area outside or in the bar area.  My car is bigger than the bar /waiting area!  I don't have a big car!The bartender was the only person in the place that we considered the most friendly.Well, the mango margarita at $12 was okay! Our meal tab was also over $120  for one salad, one appetizer, 1 sandwich, 1 mixed seafood dinner and the slow cooked pork dinner;  2 beers;  AND was almost charged for 2 extra beers we had ordered but never got!!!  So check your checks!!!!!No one smiles in the place which is filled with beautiful artwork that's for sale!  The music is blaring so everyone has to shout to talk to each other.  Good thing my husband and our male friend have loud voices.The female waitress, again, seemed like she was having a bad day....or life? Had no interest in our opinions about the food, plates were plopped down on the tables, she came to check on us twice, 2nd time, the guys asked for 2 more beers which never came. The whole experience started at 6:30pm and ended at 10!! Service and the meals didn't match the prices!!!!! Ouch!!  A hole in a wall place that leaves a hole in your pocket!!~~#~0
This place gave my wife and I salmonella poisoning~~#~0
THIS PLACE SUCKS ROCKS!  I only review fast food joints when they are exceptionally good, or exceptionally bad.  This one lives up to the name Taco Hell.   We only eat here once every few months, but it is always the same deal.  Bad food- let me clarify "bad" because let's be honest and say that all Taco Hell food is bad- by bad I mean burnt or missing ingredients or clearly been sitting under the heat lamps for way too long. Service sucks! Some of the dumbest and grouchiest and laziest people you will ever meet.  I have yet to get what I actually ordered.  And this last time, we ordered food for 4 people and I asked the girl for a handful of each of the sauces.  Yeah, she gave us 4 packets of sauce... count 'em 4; 1 of each kind!!!!  And, she didn't give us napkins or give me a fork to eat my taco salad with, which was a huge incovenience because we weren't taking the food back to a house; we were going to the park.  Good thing I had extra napkins and utensils in the car.  Stupid jackasses.~~#~0
I doubt anyone will read this, but I feel compelled to say that this is the perfect place to go if you have absolutely nowhere to go. The service here, in the afternoons no less, is consistently slow. As fun as unpredictability can be, I don't feel like playing Russian roulette drive thru because the waits here make you want to blow your brains out. One time I pulled in and ordered an iced tea. Just a typical, unsweetened, no lemon iced tea. IT TOOK 13 MINUTES!! I feel like if there's ever a time you could go into a kitchen and learn how to do fix your order and then come out in less time than it took for you to get an order, there's a problem. The only thing I'm unsure of is if its just the employees who are slow or if the inside of the kitchen is actually another dimension in which time slows down and thus making orders coming out of the kitchen take three times as long as any other Sonic takes.~~#~0
Hated it!!!  I had a pasta dish and had to pay an extra $4 bucks for 2 tiny shrimp.  My husband had a burger, which I swear would have been on the kids menu anywhere else, because it was so tiny.  Our server had absolutely no personality at all.  Would not recommend this place~~#~0
Hey Southwest:It's no surprise why people whisper behind your back, calling you "SouthWORST." It's no surprise why, when asked, your unfortunate patrons say they feel miserable whenever they fly on your airline. It's true. You make people miserable - with your strange and stupid delays, your cattle-call boarding, your small seats with no leg room and your rude, obnoxious employees. To your surprise, it does, indeed, sometimes rain in Phoenix (and even Las Vegas, for that matter). Sometimes with rain, comes fog and low visibility. I think you should have learned that in 3rd grade science. In any case, whenever it rains, you, SouthWORST, forget flying fundamentals - perhaps like an actor with stage fright - and simply refuse to perform. It's true; you make people miserable. You make them wait in other cramped airports for four to six hours (maybe longer), just hoping to soon be boarding, just hoping there's not an excruciating wait on the tar mat or that their checked bag(s) won't end up in Bangladesh.They say misery likes company. I believe you hate yourself, SouthWORST. I would, too, if I were you. So, in hating yourself, you hate others. You bully them, take their money, make them wait, cackle when you know they're hungry, tired and in need of some deodorant and a breath mint. You're miserable, SouthWORST, and you make me miserable, too. Disregards, Alicia~~#~0

We ordered a steak sandwich and the raspberry chipotle boneless wings everybody was raving about.  The steak in the sandwich had no flavor, I've had better steak at a chinese buffet.  The bread was kind of nasty..  almost stale but I think its just how it comes?  The tots were the thing we liked, but how do you screw that up.  The wings were shrivelled - kind of like chinese food in a way where they batter and fry up chicken pieces that are sliced thin and then cover with sauce.  The ends were dried up chicken and batter that were more like jerky than wings.  The sauce was creative, but definitely not the next ranch or honey mustard.  Maybe a little more of a spicy kick would make it better.All in all, won't go back.  Mostly because we don't live in the area so the next time we're there, we'll try something else.  If it was in my neighborhood, I might go back for happy hour.  Their drinks looked pretty cheap and I wouldn't feel so bad about the wings if I'm paying half price and drunk.~~#~0
The service was friendly and it seemed clean.  You place your order with the cashier, get your  drink, napkins, fork and sauces and then sit down.  They brought out our food in a timely manner.  If you like a bowl that is filled 3/4 full with rice and then a few ingredients put on top, you will love this place.  For me, this was not a good experience.  I had the small Arizona bowl.  While the portion size was generous, it was 3/4 rice.  On the top they put a scoop of mushed up imitation crab meat in some mayo and a sliced up avocado.  That was it.  No sauce, no flavoring, no nothing.  You can get teriyaki and soy sauces from the counter but, the bowl was  filled so full that you couldn't mix anything in until you had eaten the crab and avocado off the top.  My g/f got a small chicken teriyaki bowl.  This was also a bowl 3/4 full of rice with a few pieces of chicken on top and a very cafeteria tasting teriyaki sauce on the top.  I pictured them in the kitchen having a whole bunch of prepped bowls 3/4 full of rice just waiting to slap one or two ingredients on the top to fill the orders.  With so many good restaurants nearby (Sandellas right next door) I don't think this place will last for long.~~#~0
This place is terrible. The beef must have been pink slime. Go to Nando's across the street. They are not fast food but much better quality.~~#~0
Never heard back from management.  Too bad.  I wish them well, but don't ignore the customers.~~#~0
My boyfriend and I made a deliberate trip to Phoenix just to eat Chris Bianco's pizza. It was one of the worse restaurant experiences I have ever had, and I never ate the food. The snarky hostess is most unwelcoming. She informs us it will be a 3 hour wait and that I must call every hour to check in, or she will take my name off the list. As a guest, I was treated like they were doing me a favor. This chick must be bangin' somebody to keep the hostess job. When we spoke with Chris, he shrugged his shoulders, like ...."I know I've heard it before."  There was more back and forth nonsense that I will spare you from reading.  We went to the bar next door and had some wine and talked to folks. The bartender had the audacity to tell me they don't need to be nice, look how busy they are?I Um, are you in a service business or what? Does "hospitality industry" mean anything to you?!  I'll take Nancy Silverton's Pizzeria Mozza in L.A. any day; where the menu is varied, the food exceptional, and you are welcomed and treated like a guest. Even if there is a wait, it's never a ridiculous 3 hours. It's only Phoenix for Pete's sake. Spare the attitude.~~#~0
Rude customer service on telephone and not very helpful. The lady didnt even know what kind of salad dressing was on a greek salad and still messed it up! Hells Kitchen wings were dry and barely even mild. We live 0.8 miles away and delivery was between 1 hour and an hour and a half at 8:00. Then they were rude again upon delivery. One bright side was the calzone was good despite lacking ingredients ordered. Also a delivery fee is bogus after they made us add to our order to even get it delivered. Save yourself and go to Streets of New York very close by instead!~~#~0
I was so hoping to find a good barbecue restaurant near our house. Unfortunately Joe's Real BBQ just misses the mark. The food tasted watery like it had been steamed to keep it moist. Beans & slaw were just average. Cool place inside and is certainly good for families w/ kids. Wish i could say I will be back, but with so many other great choices, not likely.~~#~0
The waitress couldn't even do her job. of food was horrible.. lets say we wont be back.~~#~0
I hadn't been here in a while so I came back to check it out. That was definitely a mistake...It took us 10 minutes to even be acknowledged by a waiter after we were seated. Both the appetizers and the food took forever to come out and when they did were tasteless and awful. The restaurant wasn't that crowded, yet the service was slow and when I asked my waiter for parmesan cheese, it never came. The portions of pasta were small considering the expensive price. Thankfully, they didn't charge my friend twice when she didn't like her food the first time. I would not recommend this restaurant and suggest you stay far away.~~#~0
2 people $70+ for $12.00 worth of food given the quality.  (and $12 is pushing it)The patio is very nice and I think would be both fun and fine for drinks, chips, guacamole, and salsa.  The Salsa is quite good.  If your planning to eat, go elsewhere!However, that's about where it ends from our experience.  Tortilla factory's food didn't rate on par with even some of the taco carts around town (some of which are actually quite good, so it's probably in insult to the carts to compare them with this place).  We ordered the mole ribs.  The mole was not traditional and was very bad; ribs were dried out and cold.  I think maybe they made the mole early in the day, and then held it around.  The taste was sour, burnt, and harsh.  Not the subtle spice and flavor of a good mole.We then went on to have several main dishes.. one of which was the green pork Chile Verde.  The presentation was awful and the dish looked washed out and very bad.   Think Alpo.   The flavors of the sauce as good but, the meat was dry and tough.The other dish we had was a sweet honey steak dish.  The flavor was fair, presentation was decent however.Overall, I'd have to say I felt sorry for the servers and anyone going here thinking that they are getting a taste of local fare.   Sadly, the food is a very poor representation of the city and its diverse southwestern/Mexican culture.This restaurant has such potential due to its location, but, it's time to change out the chef or get a restaurant consultant in and refresh the menu for it ever to be taken seriously for anything but drinks on the patio.   If you want good southwestern fusion fair in old town Scottsdale, try "The Mission" on the other side of Scottsdale road and just a couple blocks south or Barrio Cafe in central Phoenix.~~#~0
For the love of gawd...what crappy, sub-par sushi that is over priced. Lunch cost me and my girlfriend $70, no specials but one roll and the sushi was equivalent to a buffet style sushi at a cheap oriental place. Just to get the taste out of our mouths and get our sushi fix we went to Stingray in Old town Scottsdale and the quality, service, larger portions and lower cost turned it all around for us.~~#~0
Closed ---- Out Of Business.~~#~0
I dont understand what people are talking about this place sucks.. The waitress messed up our order..bud lite bottle and came back with a jack n coke..really ?..i know just another dirty dive bar not moving in the right direction.. . Sorry won't be back.~~#~0
Horrible hotel! When we pulled up there were 4 police cars with several people in cuffs. There was a pair of underwear in the corner of our room. After we came home there was a charge in my credit card for the mini bar that we didn't even have a key for! This place is run down and not worth the price. They price gouge for everything. Trust me you don't want to stay here!!!~~#~0
This place had the worst food ever. Don't go here. It's overpriced too!~~#~0
It's basically $5 for a slider.  I had a bacon cheeseburger, and the short rib.  Both were average if not forgettable.  Beers are $5, so there's really no reason to ever go back.  I would much rather go get a burger for $10 that comes with fries anywhere else.~~#~0
This places STINKS! And I mean that literally. I've never smelt anything like it in my life ... but what ever it is it forced me into being a mouth breather. And finally I just had to get out ...~~#~0
Worst practice I have ever been to.  The front desk ladies chat out loud like it's happy hour.  There is ALWAYS a wait to see my doctor, Dr. Wetherell, who by the way, I had to wait to see 3 months to see as a new patient.  Anytime I was sick, I called to make an appointment and there was always at least a two day minimum wait.  Once I needed a med refill and she was out of the office.  I couldn't get me refill because none of the other docs can refill for her patients.  She really does take the time to listen when you can actually get in to see her. It is honestly easier to go to urgent care.  The best thing about TIM is Jennifer, Dr. Wetherell's MA. Now this is the last straw.  Apparently, I had 2 unpaid bills which totaled $40.  I knew I had one bill for $10 and I had said I would take care of it the next time I was in.  Well the next time I was in it slipped my mind and the women at the front desk  (of course) were too busy horsing around to ask me to clear my balance.  Supposedly Margie (maybe their billing lead) sent numerous letters which I never received and called once.  So, I was "dismissed " from the practice (I just found this out today).  I called today to clear everything up simply because I knew it had been outstanding.  The $40 is now $80 because it was sent to collections.  I suppose this practice has enough wherewithal to get an entire collections agency set up to get their beloved $40 but cannot pick up the phone to call me to collect a balance. It is truly appalling and sickening that a practice can be so money hungry and greedy.  Furthermore, all the billing department had to do was call.  I don't understand what is so hard about that.  I will be sure to advise anyone I know to stay far away from this office.  It's simply not worth the hassle and no one should be subjected to their lack of patient ethics.~~#~0
Good: Nice wines. Excellent live music. Bad: My group of 4 was told by the bartender that she had to help the seated customers at the bar first rather than us 4 standing waiiting for drinks. We entered the business 20 mins before the seated guests. WOW.Served all of us once we got a table but forgot my girls' wine. No apology. No discount. No acknowledgement. No nothing. WOW. Was an owner as well apparently.As we were leaving, no acknowledgement of thanks for coming, come back and see us, nothing. Just busy washing wine glasses behind the bar.If it was not for the live music, would not step inside this place. This is why the place will not last because of reviews like this. You HAVE to have a better customer experience.Customer service poor=lack of business.~~#~0
Stay as far away from Desert Schools Federal Credit Union as possible.  When it comes to mortgages, their practices are deceptive and misleading.  The employees at the corporate offices are not helpful, and they refuse to answer questions.  My experience with Desert Schools has been absolutely horrible.~~#~0
I love butterfield's and my family and I go there every sunday to go eat breakfast. But the only problem is the girls that work up in the front are a little ignorant to people and for it being so early in the morning not a lot of people really want to deal with that. One time my mom asked the girl if she could borrow a pen the girl looked at her said she didn't have one yet they had a whole bunch of pens in a holder....gee..what great service. The waiters are great!!! they always are on top of their game and of course since we are regulars they love to talk to us. We have told them about the girls but I think this is a perfect way to put them on blast! If you are working at a place that considers great customer service (obviously everywhere) then fake a smile and put that nasty attitude away. Being rude is not good customer service. Other than that go to Butter Fields! they have the best food of course :)~~#~0
The New Years Eve show said it started at 10 pm, and I found myself still outside at 10:45 waiting to get in.  Once we got in we notice that nobody came to take a drink order or food order from us.  All the tables around us had drinks and food and came in after us.  WTF!!!  The first 2 comics sucked, but we were there to see Kevin Nealon who was funny.  Next, some girl who was clearly under 21 was puking all over the floor next to us.  For the "Ball Drop" there was supposed to be a Champagne toast which AGAIN we NEVER got served!!  The final BS to this night was that they never brought my change from the bill I paid.  They were soooo nice that they gave us free tickets to come back and experience this crap again.  I think NOT!!~~#~0
This place is so awful that I don't even want to spend too much time writing this review.Food is mediocre, service was extremely rude, my catering order was never filled and when I called to confirm the order one hour prior to pickup they just simply told me they didn't make it and wasn't planning on doing it...huh?  I once found a cooked cockroach in my dim sum dish...that was it...would never ever go back.~~#~0
While I do not eat fast food as much I used to, I used to eat at Jack in the Box (different locations) all of the time.  I was on my way home recently from playing sports and had a hankering for a sourdough jack (my favorite) and some jalapeno poppers.  My girlfriend was with me and decided to try the sirloin burger.  What a disaster.We were exhausted and live close by so we went straight home after hitting the drive through, only to find out that we did not receive the poppers that we paid for.  On top of that, the burgers were sub par and the fries were burnt (a shame because they were curly fries).  I had not eaten at JITB in quite some time and this experience has solidified why I had stopped going in the first place.  Perhaps I should have checked the bag before leaving the drive through but when there are only a couple of cars in the drive through and no one in the restaurant, should I really have to?  Especially at 10pm when things are slow.  I will not be returning to this location and more than likely will not return to any others either.  It is a shame because the food used to be so good.~~#~0
This place gets worse and worse every time I come here- but it's the only drive thru donut shop in Queen Creek. Donuts are always cold. Drive thru service is ridiculously slow- and even the drive through configuration makes no sense. You literally have to do a loop-de-loop to: avoid cars coming out of the drivethrough and then go out the same shopping center driveway to get back on the road.  Are they taking advantage of their monopoly?  Because as soon as someone else shows up with even a little better service, DD will disappear.  To summarize some of my "best" visits: chocolate cake donut with chunk missing, shortchanged me.~~#~0
Beware!!!! If you are excited to know you got a free drink upon checking in, you will probably be disappointed. They apparantly don't accept the coupon any more. Boooooo~~#~0
I cut this new Buffet a lot of slack back in May because they had just opened, but now here it is two months later & sadly the place is still a disaster case!  I was joined for lunch today by Jose C. & Mike C.  One thing that was all fixed and ok now was the bathroom, but then?  Eek!     :-OThe biggest single problem was the food...  a strange mishmash of dishes that didn't go very well together to begin with, & then almost everything I tried today was blah tasting & VERY SALTY!  If fact, the Chicken Noodle Soup was so salty I couldn't even eat it, & I like salt!  Then my "ice water" was served at the table at room temperature, and so on.     :-OSomeone mentioned in their review that the woman & man who run the place were yelling at each other during their visit.  Yes, I heard the same thing both times I came here.     :-OAt the end we had to hunt for a long time to find the lady to pay her, & they don't even have a cash register or the ability to provide a decent receipt for the purchase.  (My business requires me to keep them.)  She fumbled around to find some money to give me my change!     :-OI like a good Mediterranean Buffet such as the ones at Cafe Istanbul & Princess Mediterranean Market, but there are just too many shortcomings here, & they've had enough time to get things on track.  Ugh!     :-OLunch Buffet:  $7.99~~#~0
Used to eat at one of about 4 of this chain's restaurants in Houston all the time, but I can say hands down that this is the filthiest one I ever ate at.  I grabbed a spoon, happened to look down at it (oh, gawd..how I wish I hadn't) and it still had scum marks from food on it.  So, I checked out all the spoons (about 15 were there) and they all were that way...mmmmmm...doesn't that make you just want to dive in here?It's filthy, the food isn't all that good and not worth even their cheap $6 as a Sr.To hell with it!  I'm going to some place I know is clean like Cheesecake Factory next time.Two words:  never again.  (I'll probably have nightmares tonight over dancing dirty spoons now, too...brrrrr...shudder!).~~#~0
This restaurant pisses me off in many ways...1. First impression walking in - lame photos, no one to greet you (even if it is a walk up counter), hardly any tables inside to seat yourself plus, the tables weren't cleaned off when we finally sat down.Service - When placing my order the guy abrasive & rude, also making me wait to place my order while he was on the phone. There was table of 4 next to me who were patiently waiting for their meal to arrive...and the food (salads & wraps) arrived one person at a time spaced apart by about 10 minutes per person. By the time the first person ate his food the last person was just getting his plate of salad. Needless to say they all looked at each other in disbelief. We finally (after 45 min) got our $20 salads and left. The food was actually ok, but not good enough to return. Bunch of old guys trying to move quickly....ooops.~~#~0
Gross.  Wife didn't even bother to take left-overs.  Place does not look clean.  A warning sign for us should have been that this "mexican" place is staffed with gringo servers.  Every quesadilla we ordered arrived soggy, not a single item we ordered was crisp.   Margarita was one of the worst we've had in the north valley (which is really saying something).  Kids seats had broken seat belts.All of this is sad because we had high hopes for this place especially after reading the positive reviews.Not mexican, but infinitely better is Mi Comida at 43rd Ave & Bell.~~#~0
Outdated. Dirty. Bad food.~~#~0
Had one meal at Crazy Earl's, the booth was unsafe with a sagging and slipping seat.  The food was fair.  Second and third time I TRIED to eat there, we stood for over ten minutes with the waitresses looking at us several times but failing to acknowledge us.   They were not even busy, so there was no excuse.  We finally sat at a booth and waited several more  minutes and were ignored.  I have never seen such crappy service.  Never have I been to any restaurant where the staff would not even acknowledge my presence and continue to ignore me for over ten minutes!  I would advise people to stay as far away from this lousy excuse for a restaurant and go to Taco Bell, the food is better.  And I am not a big fan of Taco Bell.~~#~0
So we found out why people hate this place.  We were cut off after probably drinking enough cocktails, but that is not the bad part.  I understand when a restaurant thinks someone has had enough to drink and they say no more.  The crazy part is they also cut us off from eating....What???  Awkward and embarrassing,  won't be back :-(~~#~0
I was disappointed with my experience here.  I made an order for carry-out early in the evening last week (8/21/2012).I ordered two ground beef tacos with just meat and cheese.  I could have made way better tacos at home.  The cheese looked it was shredded and tasted like it was from a package at a grocery store.  The beef was bland and had didn't have much flavor.The chips for the salsa were stale.  I also ordered a grilled chicken quesadilla with cheese and it was almost $12...way overpriced for the amount and the taste.I would not recommend this place based on my personal experience here.~~#~0
BAD. AWFUL. THE WORST.One of the worst dining experiences of my life that I keep trying to forget, but I just can't. And I have to share my experience so that some other well-meaning tourist does NOT give this place a try. In February, my man and I were visiting his family in the area. We drove to hike at the mountains, but ended up stopping for lunch instead. Our party of 5 arrived at 12:30 on a Sunday. When we asked if they were still open, the waiter replied, "I guess you'll be the last table". Umm, your hours say that you are open until 2pm on Sundays. In this economy, I don't think it's smart to turn business away, but maybe that's just me. This was the first sign of a problem and we should have walked out, but I try to be agreeable and go with the group. It was one awful thing after another: the waiter argued with our drink orders after we told him he brought the wrong thing, it took over 30 minutes to bring our chips & salsa for appetizers and the portions were insanely small. If chips and salsa cost money, you can at least give me more than 25 chips! An hour (yes, 1 hour) after ordering, the food came out 1 dish at a time. The veggie burger was just as ordered and bowl of soup was fine. The sandwich my boyfriend's nephew ordered was with the wrong meat and cheese. We heard a whole bunch of yelling with curse words and couldn't tell where it was coming from, but quickly realized that it was the cook in the kitchen. The cook seemed to be pissed off at what we ordered and didn't want to make it. My chicken sandwich came out next.  I cut it in half to discover that the CHICKEN WAS NOT FULLY COOKED. Seriously disgusting. My boyfriend's trio of "sliders" came out on 3 plates with the beef, pork and other meats partially charred (not in a good way) and the bread haphazardly thrown on top. I don't think it was supposed to be "build it yourself". We heard more yelling from the cook and then heard, "I'm f***ing done with this place" as the cook threw off their apron and stormed out. The waiter was clearly ashamed  and apologized for the cook. After some convincing, he reluctantly removed the chicken sandwich and sliders from our bill and we tried to leave as quickly as possible.Once again, I would like to say that I hate writing bad reviews.... But if I had read a review similar to mine, we would have never come to this horrible place to "piss off" the cook so much. Lesson learned!Note to the staff: It would be better to turn business away than give your patrons horrible service and be pissed off yourselves as well.~~#~0
The food was old and nasty and we did not receive all of are order and did not get correct change and on top of that they said there computers where olny taking cash no atm cards,,!!!! how is that ??~~#~0
I was referred for an MRI of my shoulder which was injured. My initial appointment was canceled by them, because they did not get pre-certification from my insurance co. They said  they would  call me as soon as they got the ok from insurance which was Aetna. That was July 21st. Now it is Aug. 1st and NO CALL. I checked with Aetna and it was approved on July 21st. I guess they are just too busy to handle everyone. I will not go there. I am a  physician.~~#~0
Just shoot me.  A Touch of Thai is just that: "a TOUCH of Thai" :)  I haven't tasted such below average Thai food before.  Go to Siam Thai not far from here, but sooo much better: http://feastinginphoenix.com/?p=289Siam Thai has more authentic taste than Thai restaurants I'm used to eating at in Phoenix.  Their Phad Kee Mao is wonderful, by the way.  They're at 5008 W. Northern Ave, Glendale, AZ 85301.  Open Tues-Sun.  Go--you won't be disappointed.  Tell me what you think after you go.~~#~0
One star. Because there is no 1/2 star. Cityscape was built in times when anything is possible and great developments are being built- SOMEWHERE ELSE. I don't know  who is the architect and I don't want to know. I would suggest the person looks for a different occupation and stop practice architecture  before more harm is being done in other cities.  If the investor asked students of architecture  - or  even culinary students - to create a downtown space- the results would be much better. There is no design. There is no interesting use of building materials. There is no landscape architecture. It is SAD.  I predict that it will be torn down within 10 years. So far all my predictions came true.~~#~0
Just awful customer service.  Like most people in the valley, I'm stuck with US Airways because they're the hometown carrier.  And after my recent experience with the airline's customer service, I mean it when I say I will do my best to avoid US Airways whenever I can.My girlfriend and I had a 2:50pm flight to Minneapolis booked for Friday, September, 16th for a wedding.  On Sunday, September 11th, a friend of ours (who was going to be in the wedding in Minnesota) was killed in a hit-and-run.  The funeral ended up being Friday at 11:00am.  With all the fees associated with changing our flight US Airways wanted nearly $650.00 dollars to change our outbound tickets.  That's more than I paid for the round trip!  It's also way inflated compared to what they were asking for the one ticket to Minneapolis at the later time.  We asked if we could just skip our flight and book the later ticket.  The agents said we would lose our return ticket if we didn't pay a $150 reissuing fee.They said they would waive the fees for people who could prove they were family.  The only way to do that was to get a copy of the death certificate, and happen to have the same last name as the deceased.  Even if I were family, how could you expect people to ask a mourning father for a copy of the death certificate because his son's horrific death was at a very inconvenient time?I know many other airlines can be just as difficult, but I never knew one could go so far out of its way to make things so difficult for bereaved customers.~~#~0
Takamatsu in Chandler is overall way better than this phoenix location. This location charges $1.25 for extra rice & a $1.00 per extra side dish. I came in with a party of 6 and of course we ran out of several side dishes since the serving size was equivalent to what they serve a party of 2.  The service was also incredibly sloooow. I will not be returning to this location.~~#~0
The wheels completely fell of this place!  After enduring a number of weeks here for work I finally gave up living in the slum and moved to a much better location right around the corner.  One to many mornings with a cold shower, cigarette burnt bedding, mystery stained towels, and horrible smells in the hallways.~~#~0
I don't write reviews, but this one is very necessary. We hired this company to manage the HOA at our complex and they turned out to be extremely incompetent and shady. It was a horrible experience. There were over 15 properties, including ourselves who dropped them from a contract after a couple of months towards the end of 2011. Money had been misused and there were high erroneous charges for simple maintenance work and quite a bit of missing money once they left. Our new company is still working to clean up the mess that The Management Trust left us. I would highly advise you to stay away from this company. They may sound like they have a lot of experience and produce great results, but it is all false! If I could rate it zero stars I would.~~#~0
French toast was gummy--pancakes heavy.  Took them 30 minutes to take our order once we were seated, another 30 waiting for our check after we'd finished, and another 15 minutes passed before my husband got fed up and had to go get his change!   Jeez.  The staff WAS friendly but I'd prefer good food and efficient service.~~#~0
Having worked in customer service and as an Administrative Professional for 15 years, I have never run across such complications booking travel!  My December wedding requires lots of flights from the Midwest so I've been trying to use Frontier.  The flights keep changing ...  direct flights be come crack of dawn connection flights (not good considering my little sister  and dad have not ever flown before!), and each time I try to call and clarify things I get nothing but more confusion and smack talk.  Then I attempted to add my cousin's flight to the mix - big mistake!  The online portal is an ABSOLUTE MESS just like the customer service line I've had to call four times now.  I didn't write down my cousin's locator because I made the mistake of thinking they would actually get the emailed confirm sent!  When I called back they couldn't even find her by name ... I had to pull up my credit card statement to prove they charged me for it and in the mean time got nothing but smack talk from the Rep.  Not cool, not cool at all.  I have many, many years more travel coordination to do, it definitely will not involve Frontier.~~#~0
This post office is one of the worst I have ever visited!Most of the time I am there they only have one person behind the counter and the line is huge. I stood in line twenty minutes and the lady had the same person at the counter the whole time. I had to leave cause I was afraid I'd be late to work, I had an hour but there were still 7 or 8 people in front of me.Also, their displays are always all messed up, I grabbed a floppy package that was on top of at least 10 others labeled as small flat rate... I finally get to the cashier and she said it wasn't flat rate, they must have been missed placed. It's a freaking post office, how stupid do you have to be to miss stock the 20 items you carry?! I said okay, where are the small flat rate boxes? She points them out and says I'll have to get back at the end of the line and that I also had to pay for the floppy package that I'd "used". It ended up being cheaper just shipping the floppy by the time it all added up, but she didn't mention this till I had already "used" the flat rate box she pointed out! Hate this post office!~~#~0
When arriving at the clinic I had no problem, but signing up for the pet insurance is a ripe off. I had purchased a puppy and took it there to get its shots. After my first visit I learned that my daughter was highly allergic to the dog so we had to get rid of it. I called right away to cancel the insurance and explained the problem but I was not refunded my sign up fee because I missed the 3 day cut off by 1 day. Okay policy I get it. Then because I had the dogs first shots given in order to cancel the policy I had to pay back the amount of the shots I already gave the dog, Okay I'll do it. I called in every month to confirm payment was made towards balance and the insurance was cancelled and for 3 months was told that it was and the amount in January would be prorated when I called in. after dec billing cycle I called in again to confirm the prorated amount the girl gave it to me and said everything would be fine. January came and I was hit with the full amount again. I called and requested a refund because now I paid too much and they refused stating I never called in to cancel my insurance and I basically lost the money. They have no record of the 3 months I called into the insurance to verify the amounts. He was rude and wouldn't listen to me but had no problem telling me it was me who wasn't understanding and I wasn't comprehending what the girls were telling me....WHAT!!. I requested to speak with a manager and he gave me a hard time then didn't even go out of his way to find me one and just pushed me to a voice mail of a suppose manager who ever to this day returned my call. BEWARE!!! these companies want you to use them but also want to ripe you off. I'm disappointed in my experience with there customer service and I'm upset that I did everything on my end and they were incompetent costing me money I don't have then don't have the respect to listen or call you back. Very ignorant.~~#~0
So I ordered pizzas for the guys moving me and the delivery guy was extremely late "he couldn't find the building with 6ft numbers on them" So when this guy gets to my place he was all pissed off because he couldn't find my place. He made a few smart ass remarks to me "probably because I din't tip him" and that's when I had enough and told him not to be a smart ass,THIS DUDE CALLED ME A WETBACK AND THREATEND TO KICK MY ASS. At the time I had a sling on with a broken hand from an accident a few days prior. I had to stop the movers who were all lationo as well from trying to beat his racist ass. All I have to say is f@#k Pizza Hut for the way they handled this situation. They never called me or refunded my money, as a matter of fact they did not know how to handle this situation because it wasn't in their employee hand book.~~#~0
recently moved to the area and since this place was close to the house I decided to give it a try.  First time I went there I was told to come back in 30 minutes.  As I had other plans that night, I didnt go back.  The next day I went again and was again told to come back in 30 minutes.  Even though I had an appointment!  Figuring 3rd time is a charm (and desperately needing an eyebrow wax!)I tried again.  Got there about 5 minutes before my appt time and was taken right back.  Ive been getting my eyebrows done for probably 14 years now and this was the most painful one Ive ever experienced!  She barely waxed but went crazy with plucking and cutting.  Im used to them trimming any crazy hairs but she went overboard.  I just wanted to get out of there as quickly as I could so I paid and went home.  After the swelling and redness went away (almost 4 hours later!!) I checked out the damage.  There are spots where she cut too much and spots where she didnt pluck enough.  To add insult to injury they are crooked!  One is cut noticeably shorter than the other.  Thank goodness for eyebrow pencils to fill them in until I can get them fixed.  I definitely will NEVER return to that place and I will NOT be recommending to anyone, not even my worst enemies!~~#~0
Valentine's Day and what can be better than a wonderful night out with my beautiful wife!  We booked reservations at Fogo de Chao and were looking forward to a wonderful evening.  We arrive promptly for our reservation and were warmly greeted by a 20 minute wait standing in an overcrowded lobby.  We overheard the hostess tell another patron that Fogo was running behind because people were taking longer than expected to eat.  I guess they did not account for folks actually wanting to enjoy their meal and their conversation on Valentine's Day.  We were taken to our table and our waiters greeted us with "Man, I am tired, can't wait until by shift ends."   - Sorry for the inconvenience.  We will try not to ask too much of you. -  Well, I think he read my thoughts because we went to the salad bar and returned to find that we still did not have our drinks, including water, or forks.  We did a quick check to see in anyone else was eating with their hands as part of the cultural experience.  But, they had forks and water, so we waited.  And waited... Finally, we flagged down a meat chef who kindly gave use the equipment necessary to begin our meal.  The food was average.  The steaks were great, but the lamb was gamey and the chicken was average and a bit dry.   The rolls were beautifully prepared and had an interesting texture.  We were invited to try their dessert, but decided that we did not want to overstay our welcome.  So we politely asked for our check and waited.... We did pass the time watching the waiters flip through the bills from other customers evaluating their tips like the IRS agents checking tax returns.  To be serious for a moment, for the price of this restaurant, we expected a more classic dining experience with a professional, attentive wait staff, etc. However, it may have just been a over overcrowded since it was Valentine's Day.   Yet, that is exactly why we picked this establishment in the first place....~~#~0
This is the slowest Starbucks I have ever been to~~#~0
Terrible prices. Terrible customer service. Almost $400 for a standard main drain snake. Almost $200 for any other drains.All of my sinks, showers and toilets were backed up. I had them snake the main drain. Solved my problem. Less than two weeks later my two bathroom sinks are backing up again. I call them, they show up over 2 hours late and tell me it will be another $200 because its a separate drain. Why didn't they tell me this may be an issue the first time they were supposed to fix ALL of the drains. Called customer service and manager was supposed to call me an never did, so I called back the next day. Did not hear back until a day after that (my sinks are sitting there clogged the whole time and I can't use them) Finally I get a call from GREG. He tried to talk over me, was rude and gave me the run around to try and shut me up. I told him I am a new homeowner and have lived in my house for just over a year and they just lost a customer for life. He did not seem to care or want to address the problem.Go with a small plumbing company they will charge you 1/4 of the price. Also, instead of nasty Drain-O, go natural and pour dry banking soda down the problem sink, then vinegar and cover the hole, it will force the mixture down the pipe. 20-30 min after that pour a gallon of boiling water down the sink. Repeat this several times on big problem drains. Works like a freaking charm. Didn't believe it until I did it.~~#~0
BEWARE!!!! DO NOT TRUST THESE PEOPLE!!!  The Pain Center of Arizona personnel are dishonest and deceptive.  They have caused me more harm than good.  I thought they were supposed to help people, but they have caused me irreparable harm and an extra $333.30 for no reason.  Instead of the commonly known "First, do no harm...",  the Pain Center of Arizona's motto must be - "First, cause irreparable harm, then rip off the patient".  I will never return to these lying, uncaring harmful people.  Repeating the warning, I cannot stress this enough - DO NOT TRUST THESE PEOPLE!!!  BEWARE!!!~~#~0
If I could give this place negative stars I would!GROSS!!!! Unfortunately, I was given a voucher to this hotel from US Airways after they cancelled our flight in the midle of the night. I gathered my baby and 5 year old at midnight from the airport and brought them by shuttle to this place. The shuttle was the nicest thing about the stay. The rooms were old and gross. The beds were uncomfortable.I should've listened to my instincts when we heard a man demand his voucher back (at 1am), he wouldn't say why he didn't want to stay there.BUGS!!!!!!!!! BED BUGS!!! ANTS!!!!In the early hours of the am, we woke up to stumble back to the airport. I sat on the floor for 3 minutes (avoiding the beds my daughters slept on) and I got 8 bed bug bites!!!!!! I stood up quickly and realized what the problem was. I understand that ants are a problem in places like TX ans AZ, but REALLY??I am almost 100% sure the staff at this hotel is fully aware of the bug problem, and does nothing to fix it.The guy at the desk was unapologetic when we told him about the bugs. He didn't go to make a phone call or even write anything down. Yuck.I hope nobody stays here by choice, or otherwise. I will be alerting the health dept or other agencies relating to this problem.~~#~0
NIce place (the inside is better than what the outside would imply)  ... VERY clean ... Pino the owner (from Italy) seems like he's always there and KNOWS his customers ... and comes off as a real nice guy ... but saddly I found that my Pepperoni Pizza had virtually zero flavor ... the pizza looked GREAT ... the crust was fine ... but I'm totally into sauce and there was no flavor to it ... bummer ... still have yet to find GREAT pizza in Phx :(~~#~0
This place is closed.  Go to Jenny's instead.  Awesome!!~~#~0
Really mediocre, just plain jane boring sandwiches.  They skimp on key ingredients, like cream cheese on the lox sandwich on pumpernickel, which btw the bread tastes stale and the worst pumpernickel I have ever had, not fresh or nice tasting at all.  Just really not a very good place and not very good sandwiches.  The thing that really earks me and inspired me to write the review is their cocky name Sacks "Art of Sandwicherie".  There is NO art going on here, just plain boring commercialized sandwiches that sound good but disappoint.  I will never be coming back, there are much better alternatives.  Basically anything other than subway will win this place out.  What a disappointment.~~#~0
I bought this as a special to try them out.  Had a very hard time getting through to anyone to begin with, when I finally did - had an appointment that they did not show up for.  Have not been able to reach them since November.  Interested to see that others had such great luck - this company is terrible!~~#~0
This might be okay for young 20-somethings, out to get smashed on $3 Happy Hour beers before heading over to the next mall bar across the parking lot, but it's no good for elderly 30-year-olds, intent on dinner conversation. If you're satisfied to eat @ one of the bar tables, you're set, but if you're looking for old fashioned floor level seating, good luck.  After a 2 hour wait (and our party had actually arrived before we joined them), we two stepped over to a restaurant where we could actually sit down.  And where we could hear each other w/o having to fight some blaring obnoxious pop music.Can't comment on the food, because we never got any.  Happy hour beers WERE cheap, but $19 for two Happy Hour Absolut and Red Bulls is highway robbery, if you ask me. Server was nice enough.  Mildly entertaining watching wasted floozies get flung from the mechanical bull.  Could have done w/o the bloody boxing match on TV.Wheelchair accessible, but only if you can get one of those aforementioned elusive tables, otherwise you'll be at the perfect height to rest your head on the table while everyone towers above you.Pretty sure I'm never going back here.  Not really my scene.  Perfect if you want to rev up your man date w/ your bull riding skills before some hot drunken anonymous weekend sex, though.~~#~0
I'm accustomed to the Scottsdale bar scene. I know it can be loud and rowdy and I don't mean that in a bad way. But the crowd at The Lodge though just seems to go too far, like they should have been cut off many alcoholic beverages ago but weren't. This seems to be the case particularly for the patio hang-out. You know the expression "falling down drunk", well I spotted several of those within 15 minutes. And they took the tables with them. Yet the the staff ignores it while the other patrons laugh and applaud.And I wouldn't recommend going on a Saturday night if you plan to eat in the dining room. You'll have trouble finding a table if you have more than 2 in your party. Now you might think I should've known better than to go with a group on what will always be a busy weekend night there but I was told when I called ahead that "sure no problem we can fit 8 in". The phone-answerer never offered to make a reservation, I got the impression The Lodge doesn't take them, but if it does he seemed to think one wasn't necessary.  Then we get there and are told there's no space in the dining room and they have no idea when there will be.The staff is friendly and that's the only reason this place even deserves one star. They may be a bit too nice. Their being lenient and easy going is one of the reasons the drunks get out of hand.~~#~0
NEVER GOING BACK!!!!Yesterday they turned off the air-conditioning. It was 90 out. When a customer complained they did nothing.THIS PLACE SUCKS!!! CAN'T WAIT FOR PORTILLO'S TO OPENLuke's will be history in 6 months.~~#~0
well, maybe it was the  time I went or what I had but I would have to give them about the same rating as I would give red lobster. I can't understand how anyone could like Red lobster if you know what good seafood is.I was born and grew up with family from Baltimore Maryland where good seafood is what the city is about.I was excited to try it as I love seafood but my food just was not good. I can't say my service was all the great either. I would not go again~~#~0
I have not left a dining establishment as upset as I was when I left Pearl. The experience I had as absolutely horrible. I am not one to make a big deal about nothing and I, more often than not, give people the benefit of the doubt, but I can honestly say I was shocked and EXTREMELY furious after my visit. I bought a localdines certificate to go to Pearl and have been dying to try the place out. They have a great menu and it is in a fun location. The terms on the localdine clearly state that it is ONLY VALID MON-THURS. We went on Tuesday at 7pm, sat down,  I pulled out the coupon and was promptly told by the bartender "we dont accept those on tuesdays" then he walked off. Let me also clarify that while it was 7pm it was not crowded or busy. There was NO ONE else sitting at the bar with us. I waited for him to come back so I could show him that it clearly says on there that it is Valid ONLY MON-THURS. He then notified me that it was in fact NOT valid on Tues or Thurs because they have specials. I explained to him that we drove more than 30 minutes to get there and we could order off the main menu and not get any of the specials if that would be ok....He said it was out of his hands and he couldnt do anything and walked off. A female server chimed in that "there's nothing we can do to help you, its just how it is" then she also just walked away. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? Not a SINGLE person was willing to talk to us and explain things or give us 2 minutes of their time. The customer service was absolutely ridiculous. I have NEVER been treated so rudely in a situation that I clearly had a right for clarification. Today 10/5/2011 I see that Localdines is featuring Pearl with the SAME coupon that clearly states VALID ONLY MON-THURS. Needless to say, I am making it a point to write a very appropriately rude review about this place. The menu looks amazing, many people have written reviews about the great food....I however, never had a chance to try the food because I couldnt get past the servers who made us feel like we weren't worth their time. Save yourself the snotty Scottsdale attitude and go to Ra, Stingray, Sapporo or Sushi Brokers....they will not only serve you good sushi, they will also be polite.~~#~0
Well the first few times is okay.  After that, the place goes down hill.  The staff there seems friendlier to Iowans, or those who are not NYers.  Had 2 bad dinners there..quit going after that.  The pie is good.  Go for dessert.~~#~0
I would love to be writing a great review of this place.  Unfortunately, this is not a good one and I cannot even review the food since we didn't even get that far..We were seated and waited for about 20 minutes with no service.  We then went up and approached the hostess and told her no one had come to our table yet.  She said she would send someone over right away.  There were plenty of servers yet no one had stopped at our table and it wasn't even a full house.  At that point after 30 minutes of no service we decided to leave. THE END.~~#~0
One of the worst dining experiences I've ever had! At $2.50 per slice of sashimi, I expected a lot better than a recently defrosted and grainy slice of tuna. Also, do not get the Lobster Roll...it tastes like shrimp tempura that costs $27. The service was also bad. The manager knew we had a large party (we made reservations) and assigned a new waitress to handle the table by herself. We got through half of the meal before getting our beers, and it took 30 min (not exaggerating) to get our bill. Would not go back.~~#~0
Do not use this dental office, unless you want to be overcharged. Their prices are higher than most dental offices in town. Not only are their prices higher...they give their patients skewed approximations of what insurance will cover and what the patient will have to pay. Also the office will try and upsell you left and right on many additional features that are unnecessary. They also try and spread out the visits to receive more payments from insurance companies as well. One day x-rays. Next week cleaning. Despite the higher prices, I had a couple of cavities taken care of at this office because the staff seemed nice and professional, and two weeks after my cavities were fixed, I received a call from the office staff telling me I owed over $600 in additional to the $400+ I had already paid. Their estimate was approximately 70% off of what they had originally stated insurance would cover. What BS. I've heard of estimates being a little off, but not by over 70%. If you are looking for a dentist, find another. There are many high quality dentists in Scottsdale. AVOID THIS OFFICE.~~#~0
Have had nothing but difficulty with this bank, they got my business by claiming that they were a real "community" type bank. They are not, all employees we met with when we opened the account have been replaced a couple of times. Judging by the high turnover and the lack of intelligence in half of the staff, i think i will be moving to a Credit Union as soon as my partner gets back to town and we can move the business account.~~#~0
Heard all about Five Guys being the best burger place in Phoenix...  NOT! Was very disappointed! First the cost! Give me a break! Just ordered a burger fries and drink for over 12 bucks? Forget it! Not impressed! In fact, I was at Fat Burger near Metro Center last month and was blown away! That burger was DELICIOUS and the fries rocked, these were gross! Some over cooked others raw! nope, once was enough for me!~~#~0
The Village Tavern...the name alone reminds me of some hole in the wall bar. I had a friend that swore by this place, because she use to live by it, and we were actually going to go to Houston's but went the wrong way on Scottsdale ,so we ended up here. It was the middle of the afternoon and after walking in I felt like i had entered a geriatrics ward, we were the only two people in the place besides the staff that was under 40.My friend got the wraps which were so bad she could not even eat them, so our server removed them from our bill, I got the chicken club sandwich with pasta salad and iced tea. Our service for the most part was pretty bad, we had like 5 different people come to our table when we were there, not a 100 percent on who our server actually was, but we would ask one person for a refill and they would say sure then someone else would come back with no drink refill.Our table was a bit dirty when we sat down. in general this placed sucked, service was poor, the food was garbage, and in general even though this place is huge it truly is like a hole in the wall shit bar restaurant.~~#~0
Nasty. Terrible service, hotel food. Save your money or go to via de los Santos up the road!~~#~0
I will apologize now, just to get it out of the way  :) Winter in Phoenix is not winter, oh the calendar says December, but in reality it's barely Fall. I know, it's a desert, but people really need to relax if it's cloudy and rainy for more than 2 hours. I swear If I hear " I hate the clouds and rain" one more time I'll snap  "Boston Style" Seriously it's sunny here 320 days a year, and over 100 at least 30 - 40 days a year. Another 75 days are spent hovering between 90 - 99, and the rest, is like a decent summer day in Boston. So get over it, it's raining, and it's below 70, break out your wool sweaters, and UGG boots, quick!!  I welcome the variety, the change, the difference. I like weather that provokes you, and gives you feelings, and emotions, that sets a time table for understanding the world around you. 4 seasons inspires, the change is welcome, the colors, the scent, the food, the clothing, the difference is great.  So embrace the change, it will be hot as $hit in no time, and sunny everyday, you can all put your flip flops back on, and cargo shorts very soon, don't worry it will be OK. Oh and be sure to drive 25 MPH when it's raining, because modern day tires don't work well on wet surfaces, and wiper blades in AZ, don't work the same as they do in the North East. I know all you complainers are not from Arizona, so you have no excuse for not knowing how to drive in the rain..../end rant, goes back to planning my move back to Boston LOL! :)~~#~0
I was very disappointed in the Fry's at 18420 North 19th Ave today while shopping. I ALWAYS go to this Fry's to get my groceries and NEVER have had problems like I had today. I went with my mother to help her get her groceries, well it is a good thing I did. While waiting in line,we noticed there was only two checkers that were open. There had to have been at least 10 people behind us in both lines. These people did not have small loads of groceries either, they were big. This poor guy behind my Mom had a small load and she let him go in front of her. She was being nice. Well they finally did open another line and a women just pushed her way in front of my Mom. I said to my Mom, how rude, the lady was out of ear shot. At any rate, when we got up to the checker, the lady who was bagging groceries just up and left, knowing full well how much groceries my mother had. The lady who was the checker could certainly not leave her post and go get someone to bag groceries. The lady who was the checker was doing her JOB. It was not her fault. So another checker was paging and paging for extra baggers and checkers. No one was listening to her page. Nobody came to help. There were other baggers on either side of us as well. Ultimately, I ended up bagging most of the groceries myself (of course my mother helped). My mother cannot lift heavy bags any more because of her heart so it is NICE when someone HELPS her bag them. I was very upset and disappointed today with the lack of customer service at Fry's. I have worked in retail before and have never treated anyone with that much disrespect in my life.~~#~0
I have been here twice and not my choice.  I don't have any reason why this would be on my list of choices for sushi.  It's loud, obnoxious crowd, and way too expensive!~~#~0
Once you try to cancel your membership GOOD LUCK TO YOU. I tried to cancel over the phone, but it is their "policy" for YOU to drive to their store to cancel. Since it was ONE day past th day that they charge, I had to pay $22 even though I would not use that month since I was cancelling... I tried not to chew out the girl behind the counter, & I paid the money so I could leave. NOW they have overdrafted my old bank account for THIS month, even though I went in store and have it in writing that my membership is cancelled. Not only am I writing this review, but I am going to report them to the Better Business Bureau because they have now TAKEN $42 of my money & I refuse to let them get away with this.RESOLUTION:This issue happened a few months ago, and one of the managers helped me in getting the amount refunded to my account. There is no doubt that their policies & account system needs to be updated, but I am glad that the managerial staff stepped in and took care of me once I informed them of this issue. However, I will not return as a customer.~~#~0
HORRIBLE! AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!I bought a $600 ring for my girlfriend and was told that resizing the ring was including in the price. When she tried to get it resized a week later, she was told it would be an extra $40. I asked to speak to a manager as I was previously told this service was built in to the cost I had paid, and I was told a manager wouldn't be on duty for another 4 days.1) What kind of department store has a manger only check in once every four days, especially considering this was a Saturday when I visited!?!2) What kind of cheapskates nickle and dime you over a resizing fee when you spend $600 on a piece of jewelry?3) What kind of idiots make you wait 30 minutes to see a mid-level manager to tel you to wait to see an upper level manager when they feel like coming in four days later?Previously, I bought all my jewelry from Barneys or Nordstrom. I have learned my lesson from buying from places like Macys, and will never make that mistake twice. TJ Maxx has better service than Macys.~~#~0
GCU somehow obtained our home phone number after my wife signed up with some online job recruiter.  Once they got our phone number the calls from GCU started flooding in.  These scumbags actually REFUSE to remove you from their telemarketing lists.  By that I don't just mean that they continue to call but they actually had the nerve to admit they won't remove me.If this company acts like this to a complete stranger that has never done (and will never do)  any business with them imagine how they'd be willing to treat you if you're a student at this place?~~#~0
Maybe we just went on a bad day, but I'm not sure how these reviews are so positive.  My friend and I went to Ken's after seeing the good reviews on Yelp.  The place is dark and not very sanitary.  The women working on our feet were CONSTANTLY preoccupied with personal calls and texts, and not very friendly.By far the worst part was the waxing.  No joke - they used MASKING TAPE.  Not only was it a weird practice, but I had skin problems from the tape for a few weeks after.  The whole experience was very unsatisfying and a little unsettling.~~#~0
I took my daughter's car here for an oil change and an air conditioner inspection.  I had a coupon for a free inspection, and had called earlier in the day to find out the cost of an oil change, since they don't have their prices on their website.  When I called, I was told the basic oil change was $19.95, which included a new filter and a tire rotation.  So when I showed up and saw on their signage that the basic oil change was $24.95, not $19.95, I informed Richard, the guy who was helping me, that I had called earlier in the day and was told a different price.  He actually tried to go back and forth with me to try to say that I was wrong! Like I was somehow confused about where I called or what I was told!  Really?  Its not even about the $5 difference, because I was ready to pay that despite the fact that I was told a different price.  Its about the fact that this fool really tried to dispute the validity of what I was saying, like I need to lie about FIVE dollars!  That's SOME customer service!  I guess I should have read the other reviews before I came here!~~#~0
Comic Bowling... DJ's...Lasers... sounds like fun don't it??? Well I thought it was going to be fun, according to their website I was picturing a dark, glow in the dark bowling alley with lasers and loud blaring music and drinking.  Hmm Hmm.. Went to cosmic bowling with a group of friends. Well we get there right when comic bowling starts... They had shut down all the lanes and started a line of people to start getting everyone ready.  Right away I noticed the crowd of people..  not what I was expecting...There were a lot of kids out late at night and still jumping and running around, and when I say kids I mean 3,4 and 5 year old's.  Finally got our lane and I was expecting it to get really dark so we could enjoy the black lights..  Nope didn't really happen, it still stayed pretty light in the bowling alley, and the lasers sucked.. Then I started waiting for the DJ and loud music.. ummm no.. that didn't happen either... they had put on some really bad music video's that we couldn't even hear over the bowling balls rolling down, which was probably a blessing.  Then we go to the bar to pick up some pitchers of beers, not any good beers on tap and the ones they had were super expensive for this dive place.. We stayed cause we paid money to play.. We left around 1:30am, and the kids were still running around like crazy, I kept thinking to myself, what the F**k are all these kids doing up at this time... I won't be going back..~~#~0
Played this course today, course was in ok shape.  There is no sand in bunkers, but I guess if you don't it into them you shouldn't have to worry. There was no ranger on course at time s there was 3 foursomes on same hole led to 6 hour round.  If they are going to allow this slow pace make the cart girl work all day only saw her once on front side.  I do not recommend this course.~~#~0
DC Ranch Market Street Location...So my wife, kids, and I were in town visiting friends we hadn't seen in awhile and they brought us here.  Their choices for restaurants are usually spot on though I must say The HERB BOX was a huge disappointment.  Being apart of The Slow Food movement I expected more.  The only thing SLOW was the service and smiles.  In a shopping center where stores are closing down left and right a smile can go a long way.  Instead we were ignored by the hostess who finally when deciding to realize that we were waiting for a table excused herself to locate us a place to sit on the patio.  Mind you it was a Saturday and the patio was empty (sign of the times, or the food and service?).  She then returned 10 minutes later surprised to see us  still waiting for a table.  Her attitude towards us because of having young children with us was appalling.  It's a Cafe/Bistro not a 3 star Michelin restaurant that only serves dinner!  My 4 year olds manners are better than hers are.  The food was also nothing exceptional, panini shouldn't take 30 minutes when there are no other people at the restaurant except wannabe socialites sitting at the bar patio side.I would definitely not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  What a shame!!!  The HERB BOX will probably be the next store to close down in the DC Ranch Market street shopping center.~~#~0
Hype, hype, hype ... $16.50 for two burgers and two waters.  You have to be kidding me.  They press the juice right out of the burgers as they make them on the grill (to make them cook quicker-but kills the flavor).  Burger King has a better product for 1/5 the price.  Very bad, unless you like getting little value for your hard earned money.  Some people in Scottsdale don't mind paying top dollar for Burger King quality food.  One star is GENEROUS.~~#~0
I went to this place after reading the reviews on Yelp, but I was very disappointed.  I ordered some pulled port and sausage with some various sides.  The sausage tasted like a hotdog!!! I took it back to the counter thinking they accidentally gave me a hotdog happy meal or something... The pulled pork was average and the collard greens were good, but for 20.28 for one meal, that's just wrong.  Maybe I'm being too critical, but I threw away a little more than half of the food I was served... I've lived in Texas and Georgia and know what good BBQ tastes like, but I wouldn't recommend this at all.~~#~0
I visited Sammy's this past Sunday. My first impression was that it was a good place to watch sports. I was pleased that they offered Pepsi products and told the bartender that I was the designated driver as I ordered a Diet Pepsi. My friend and I went to one of several open tables.It was a typical dive bar with great televisions. The wings were very good and our bartender was very attentive. Sadly, the waitress who came on midway through the first games completely ignored our table. My friend and I had to get our own water. I was appalled when a man (presumably the owner, who should know better) walked in smoking a cigar. The stench alone was enough to turn my stomach.I was further appalled when I saw that I had been charged for my soda and the few refills I had. Really?? Very few bars actually penalize the designated driver by even charging for one soda, much less charging that person for refills. At $2.25 each, it would have been cheaper for me to drink beer. If she had been kind enough to tell me that refills were not free, I would have ordered water as a refill. I'm surprised they don't charge for that (and they probably would if they could). I did express my surprise to the bartender and she said she had to follow the rules. Hopefully this review will have the owner revising those rules.All in all, I will not go out of my way to go to Sammy's. I know of many other great sports bars (dives and nice pubs) who seem far more appreciative when I spend my money. Hopefully the owner will extinguish his cigar before walking through his pub. And hopefully he will revise his policy of giving a designated driver a free soda for being responsible and driving drinking friends around the valley.~~#~0
Will not do separate checks~~#~0
Very bad.  We couldn't deside which was worse....the food or the company...both low quality.  This is an example of where buffets get there bad name.~~#~0
I wish there was a way to give zero stars.  Went here with a group of friends and the staff refused to give us an additional chair despite the fact that there were several open chairs throughout the restaurant.  When I finally went to grab an open chair the host literally pulled the chair out from under me.  I have never been treated so bad in my life. Rude staff. Will never go here ever again.~~#~0
Save your cash... No literally they only take cash lol. This sorry excuse for a breakfast restaurant only believes in two things which is to make your visit as expensive and quick as possible. Our experience was just plain weird. We were greeted by the waitress with "okay I need your orders now" literally just sat down by the way. Lol. We both thought that was weird and I can't even begin to start with the menu. Everything is overpriced cheap crap served a la carte and don't try to ask for any substitutions or you will be immediately rudely bombarded from three waitresses all chiming in saying you can't make any substitutions "No Exceptions". Lol! Also as this is going on our waitress is furious scribbling on her notepad. Which I have no idea what she was writing down lol. The food came out cold, no surprise there lol, and here is the best part.. We are 10 minutes into our meal and not our waitress but another one comes over and says " I need your payment now.. Thank you" what??? Lol at this point I am just cracking up and laughing. Our experience ends with our waitress leaving the restaurant without waiting for a tip. No literally leaving the restaurant, we saw her get into her car and leave. Lol ! So weird and we left giving the tip to another waitress who didn't even serve us. Wow what a joke, don't spend your money here, I am very surprised they are still open. And a message to the staff, get a back room for your bus boys, they were literally standing next to our table talking, making jokes and watching us eat our food waiting for the moment they get to take our plates. This place is just down right weird.~~#~0
Around Thanksgiving, we went to Mint Thai for lunch (it being our usual thai lunch spot). What a mess. The food wasn't tasty when it arrived - and it had taken forever to get the attention of the waitress for anything. In the end, out of a party of 4, only 1 of us had received what we ordered, 1 of us was violently ill (and remained so for DAYS - having to visit the doctor, etc), 2 of us felt moderately ill later, and only one of us felt ok. Such a disappointment.~~#~0
We are having some motorcycle issues. My brother has been building bikes and cars for over 25 years, so he is walking Dragnet through what needs to be done. Basically his 2012 bikes chain came off.. Not good. Not his fault. He actually flipped off the bike when the chain came off. on Bell road, luckily nobody took him out. Now he has a lot of $$$$ work that needs to be done. And you bet your butt Ride Now will be covering it. From what I have read and heard, I'd stay away from here when it comes to buying anything with a motor.~~#~0
Tonight at the marquee, during say anything, security guards used abusive force on another concert goer. This man, was standing 10 feet from me the entire time. The guards say he got into a fist fight with another guy during the show, this did not happen, although there may have been a confrontation. The security pulled him out side, threw him to the ground. Then each one had a different limb of... his and was twisting it in awkward and painful positions while they searched him. The whole time he was asking them to use less force he didn't do anything wrong and wasn't resisting. When the cops showed up, they flat out lied. i was standing in the smoking section watching/ listening, they told them how he attacked them along with another patron of the show. after the show i went to form a complaint about this event and i was brushed aside and told to leave. if you do a quick google search on reviews of the marquee you will find that this happens a lot. something needs to be done to stop this.~~#~0
I've been to Uni multiple times for a manicure due to its close proximity to ASU's campus. However, I always leave thinking I would rather have done my nails myself for free. Also, the technicians rush me upon my arrival which gives me anxiety about choosing a color which I feel I should do at my leisure given its a spa-like environment. The worst part of my experience at Uni is that I leave with messy looking nails, an empty wallet (a $20 mani?) and feeling of being unpolished (pun intended).~~#~0
So sad it's closed!!!!~~#~0
Can't even tell you how disappointed I was on Saturday morning when I stopped by to get a doughnut and coffee. HEY MANAGER you need time management!!! I ordered two doughnuts (not the ones I like) They were out of the UN GLAZED ????? But never the less I would gladly eat what I had ordered . HOWEVER what is a doughnut without COFFEE.. I ordered a large coffee and was told I would have to wait for . Now why would a coffee shop not be prepared .  The manager said 20 minutes to wait for coffee. WHAT!!!! I refused to buy the doughnuts and found myself at Tammie Coe's spending way too much money but got served immediately.  Tell you the truth, I am giving up on doughnuts and certainly this place needs new management for sure. Take the boys scout motto BE PREPARED...............~~#~0
I went to the newly renamed 9/05 with a group under the recommendation that they did their tofu dishes really well and catered towards vegetarian foods.I guess the tofu itself was decent; thick, firm and textured, but the curry (which had been vaunted as one of the best dishes) fell completely flat. Where was the spice? Where was the flavor?? Why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked? To add insult to injury, everyone else at the table who had ordered the Pad Thai and Bangkok Dynamite dishes sniffling and complaining about the spiciness of their food. "I'm Mexican" whispered one lady "I LOVE spice, but this is too much with the chili flakes". At the end of the meal there was plenty of leftover food which everyone declined to take home. The entrées started at 10$ and so did the drinks, I was priced out of ordering one of their 15$ "martinis" and stuck with a four dollar beer. The building itself seems pretty neat; the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn't eat here again.Someone mentioned that ownership changed hands with the name changing, maybe the good cooks left as well?~~#~0
After enjoying Fatburger for years we were extremely disappointed in Smashburger coming in with the mediocre, lack luster burger,  the snotty ("I'm from San Diego") staff , the pricing, and the poorly laid out menu board, which is why the line takes so long! I hope Fatburger comes back, and this place goes back to wherever it's from. 2nd trip we had the Arizona burger, fries, onion haystack and soft drink x2 and spent just under $30 bucks.~~#~0
The reviews here are true! Also, there are 2 review pages for this local. Don't be fooled! I pay to have my car detailed. They DONOT thoroughly clean the car before the fax your vehicle causing HUGE swirl marks throughout the paint. They are lazy and expect you to believe their BS when they say the car looked like that when they started working on it. My car was 2 week old and just came off the boat from Japan when I had it waxed at this facility. It have 200 miles on it. I had to threat nearly everyone to lay down compound and fix the swirls they put into the car. Needless to say I will never come back. If you do not value your car.. feel free to have them touch it.~~#~0
Wow. This place is awful. Just so so so awful.They don't accept credit cards, they have a small selection, and it's kinda dirty. The worst are the employees, though. I was always grateful for a cashier that was just indifferent towards me rather than openly hostile.I had one experience where I opened a fridge to get a Vitamin Water, and a bottle of water just fell out. As I was picking it up to put it back in, the cashier walked up to me and said I had to buy it. I thought she was joking, so I sort of chuckled, and then her scowl told me she was serious. I explained that I wasn't about to pay for an (undamaged) bottle of water that fell our of her fridge just because I opened it. She then said she'd call the police!!! I walked out and said call 'em - I'm parked there and you can take down my license plate. Then the sketchy customers in the store started heckling me.That was my last visit.~~#~0
i don't understand what all the hype is about this place.  been there once and thought the food was very bland...and the bottled coke was pretty much the same price that i would pay for a margaritta at  any other place.  it shouldn't be that hard to impress me at a mexican restaurant considering i usually partake in my favorite activity while watching a cheech and chong flick before i get some grub. oh well.  i would puff puff pass this place in a heartbeat.~~#~0
I will never be back. Was told by owner to leave because we ordered water!  The owner was RUDE too! I tipped her bartender for the service.~~#~0
Just popped into Bicycle Haus this past week looking for new components for my ride. I was looking at a custom order  (~$1500 worth). Guy behind the counter was busily typing away and thanked me and said he'd call me. I walked around the corner and glanced over my shoulder. Turns out the guy was on Facebook the whole time....very disappointing.~~#~0
Went with friends to Brad's Place, Elliot Rd. in Phoenix on 12/21/2010. We arrived at 6:15 PM and the place was half filled. We placed our food order and finally had to asked where the food was, 30 minutes later. The server said it would be coming up in 5 minutes, the second time she had said that. I finally went to the kitchen ans asked where our food was. The cook(who was dressed like he was homeless and dirty) said 5 minutes but there was no plates on the prep counter. I went back to our table and said, "we are leaving". I do not know what happened at do not care but we went to Keegans on Ray Road and the service was 100 times better than Brad's.~~#~0
Just when it looked like a normal parking lot I drove back and found a plethora of open parking spots... but then they all said reserved for such and such business (not Oreganos).  They managed to do it again - find a location with inadequate parking, except this one's in mesa.  Restaurant size was better than the others, but it is plagued with Millennial college kids from across the street.  Food & menu are no different than the other locations as far as I can tell, and thankfully I was in and out rather quickly with my 2 slices and Hefe-Weizen.  Service was a little slow which is frustrating when you're at the bar and you see the bartender having personal conversations with other staff.~~#~0
A very important indicator of Mexican food is the beans. Unfortunately, Teepee served up overbroiled, dry beans. A 2nd indicator is the Margaritas. A drink with Patron should have a bit of kick; the bartender had a second chance to get it right - no luck. Caution: very noisy.Service was excellent. However, there isn't much reason to return given neighborhood competition.~~#~0
I heard someone call Applebees the Walmart of restaurants and I couldn't agree more. Everybody assumes I would love this place because it has apple in the name and I really like apple themed things. But no. Ugh. Gross. Nothing on the menu is good and the prices aren't even cheap!! I can understand cheap prices for cheap food but the prices are the same as Chilis or TGI Fridays. Except they have good food.The service is always horrible. The only reason I ever come here is because my boyfriends parents love it. No idea why.~~#~0
The first time I ordered take out here was during the lunch rush and the service was great, I couldn't have asked for better, they even waited for me to get there before getting my lemonade so the ice wouldn't melt, but I wasn't on Yelp at that time, so I couldn't review it.This time, we called in at 8pm for take out, were told we were going to be connected to the bar to have them take our order, so we hung up after 5 minutes of being on hold, and went to Delux instead.~~#~0
I've been to Kens on 2 prior occasions and had good service.  This morning I made an appt for 2pm for a pedicure and gel manicure at the same time.  No problem I was told.  I arrived on time and was asked to be seated at a nail tech station. I explained I had an appt for combined services and was told there wasn't an avail pedi chair.  No problem.  Once a chair was avail, of course they would just transfer me over, right?  NOPE!The salon took care of a 2 separate walk-ins BEFORE they took care of a repeat customer who had made an appointment and gives good tips.  Unacceptable customer service.  After 25 minutes, a party of 3 obnoxiously loud folks from the South are escorted to chairs.  Stunned, I told my tech that I was only going to do nails and he looks up at me and says, "sorry about that" It gets better....  My tech, who by the way did a meticulously nice job on my gel manicure, was nice enough to use a business card as a color swatch.  45 minutes later I pick up the color swatch along with my cell phone and pay for  the mani...1/2 of the services that I had expected to receive at the same time since the babysitter meter was running. (I still left him 20% tip by the way).  I walk out the door and noticed red color on my chest and drops on my maxi dress, then notice it's on the palm of my hand.  I looked down and see red polish all over my cell phone and inside my beloved handbag!  CAUTION:  gel polish doesn't dry unless it's cured with clear coat.  I had no idea and obviously the tech didn't either because I reached over to get the card from his side.  I did my best to channel my inner Jackie O. and calmly walked back in to inform my tech what happened.  He replied with "oh no" and a a nervous laugh and then just looked down WORKING ON A PEDICURE!!!!!  Another gentlemen walked over with acetone and a cotton ball and was nice enough to try to help me.  Thank the lord it came off my fancy handbag and phone.  My favorite go to maxi dress is now stained.  Hey, I wasn't expecting a mani on the house (although places like Allure Nails at the Promenade and Nails on the Rocks in Carefree would have comped me I'm sure), but at a minimum I should have gotten a sincere apology from the tech who let me pick up that business card.  Shame on him.~~#~0
Oh my God, tell me this place was just having an off night. Three of us sat on the patio on a not overly crowded Sunday night pre-Fiesta Bowl for a good 1/2 hour before we could flag down a waitress to remove the old check from the table and recognize our presence. 15 more minutes before our bad drinks arrived (I could not finish my nasty Cosmo concoction). Another 1/2 hour before spinach and artichoke dip, which tasted like vomit with cheese, showed up.Terrible in every possible way, save the nice outdoor space - a dime a dozen in this area.~~#~0
No dice!My family and I visited Chuy's on a Tuesday afternoon.  We recently moved to the Mesa area and wanted the opportunity to check out some of the local restaurants to see what was in the neighborhood.  Upon entering the restaurant we couldn't help but notice how outdated the signs are on the wall, the decor looks beat up, and the place was dead.  I think one other table besides us was in the restaurant.  The waitress came up and told us we could sit where we wanted and to help ourselves to the free chips and salsa bar.  That sounded yummerz!  No dice again.  The chips were stale and the salsa was pretty so-so, but you couldn't even eat it with the chips being so awful.  Next came the service, or lack thereof.  We waited forever for our drinks, and I want to reiterate that there were only 2 tables in the restaurant; ours and another.  Finally the drinks came and she brought a pitcher of water to the table.  That was a quality move, and the reason why they got 1 star compared to 0 stars (I know you can't give 0 stars).  The food was a disaster and everything looked like a punch in the stomach.  I felt like if I ordered anything from this overly deep-fried menu that I would be looking at a few hours on the pot or bent over clutching my stomach in the fetal position from the stomach ache it would give me.  Finally I decided to make the plunge and just go for it - a rancho style wet chicken burrito.  I figured I needed to give this place a reasonable chance to come out of left field and totally impress me.  Guess what?  No dice!The burrito looked like grocery store Jose Ole brand, and like it was taken out of the microwave too soon.  I had a few bites and submitted to the painstakingly bad burrito.  My Mom ended up sending her food back, and my Dad, well, he'll eat anything.Overall this place is NOT the spot for food.  I hear they have great drink prices and that it is a fun place to kick it and what not, but they should close their kitchen.~~#~0
Nice to look at, does anyone actually buy anything here? The only time I ever went was to eat at the Italian restaurant. They don't have hardly anything in the way of stores... this place is the perfect example of what happens when someone with loads of money fails to manage their property properly.~~#~0
I'm sorry I have to give this place any stars at all. It's horrible. The jokes may have been nonsexual and sans profanity but they were racist, homophobic, and not funny. You can tell a comedian lacks talent when they start in on the asian pidgin talk or effeminate man for 90% of the jokes. I felt like I paid to see the final project for a comedy class. I'd rather have multiple paper cuts to my eyes than return to Jesterz.~~#~0
From reading these previous reviews, I chose Bar Smith as the rendezvous place for my birthday.  I had never been there and I live downtown...so I wanted something close and cool.  This place looks great from the outside too.  Turns out that the experience sucked.  They list their hours online for Saturday as open 4pm-2am.  I told my party to show up at 8pm.  When we got there, they were not open and they told us that they wouldn't be open for "a while".  They acted like we were idiots for showing up.  It really pissed me off.  Thankfully they let me put a sign on the door directing my party next door where we waited at another lame bar.  When most of my party showed up, we bolted for Bikini Lounge.  What a bad start for a b-day night.  Two thumbs down for Bar Schmutz!~~#~0
New to the Tattoo world I went here due to a referral. I spent over $700 dollars and got the worst tattoo...the artist ? can't remember his name colored in my whole chest with green...like paint by numbers-no outline of florals....had to go to another shop since they refused to fix or even take my calls. I am now $1500 into a tattoo that still has bizarre green back ground. If you have a picture they probably do fine...for me I was trusting the artistic ability and they don't have it.~~#~0
DO NOT go to this company. They have terrible customer service, especially at the corporate level! My wife, who worked at a jewelry store for over 3 years, and I took her wedding and engagement ring to be cleaned by what we thought were professionals. They were more than happy to take our ring and charge us for cleaning but getting the ring back was more complicated than it should have been; actually it was impossible because they lost it. When my wife went to pick up her ring they gave her somebody else's ring to which my wife promptly told them that "this is not my ring." Long story short it took them over a month to locate the ring which was sent to a Zale's customer some how and to get it back into our hands. No one has reached out to us to apologize, nor have they made any attempt to rectify the gross negligence of their company and the people they employ. The corporate representative that I had to contact myself was absolutely useless and lacked any sort of professionalism. Her emails were condescending, lacked any kind of sympathy or responsibility, and it always seemed like she didn't even think we were worth her time. For a company that supposedly "For five generations, Ben Bridge has been committed to offering the finest jewelry and unsurpassed personal service at the best value." they sure know how to shit on their customers. They definitely don't have unsurpassed personal service as they don't even care about their customers or the extremely personal, meaningful, and expensive jewelry that is entrusted to them. We will never use Ben Bridge ever again and we will make sure to dissuade anyone and everyone we know to keep them from experiencing the same stress and trauma we did.~~#~0

I haven't been here for awhile since I moved to central Phoenix and either my taste buds got more discriminating or I got used to the pho restaurants in Phoenix. I ordered pho tai: the soup tasted salty, lacked depth I.e. sweetness, cloves, something..and the beef in the soup was tough, overcooked, and bland! I also got the barbecue spring rolls but it was small, thin, and also tasted salty without the sweet kick.  I also got Vietnamese coffee but it came "ready-mixed" in a plastic cup with ice and not in the "fun to mix little coffee canister" that most Vietnamese restaurants give you. I give only one star for the food and I'll stick to Da Vang restaurant on 19th Ave.~~#~0
Yelp says open till 11:00 pm, arrived at 10:00 pm on Saturday night to empty place and informed that kitchen closed 5 mins ago.  Driving 15 minuted with a larger group than in entire restaurant makes me feel that mgmt or owner was not present.  If kitchen closes at 10:00 pm, please say that in Yelp :-)~~#~0
completely sucks.  I hate this location and anyone who has ever worked here.~~#~0
Filiberto's is amazing, but skip this location. The food here is the worst~~#~0
Yuck. How can any Mexican joint have absolutely no flavor in their meat? I really wanted to like this since it's close by and I'm all about 24 hour fast food! Bummer.~~#~0
My wife and I ate their for the first time this past weekend. This was probably the worst dining experience we have ever had. The service was extremely poor. The restaraunt was very busy and there were 95% asian customers there. It seemed as though all of the other customers were being taken care of just fine. So I felt as though there was a biased towards other customers because we were non-asian. Our waitress came to our table and took our order and that was the last we saw of her. She never came to our table once to offer drink refills or to see how our meal was. At the end, the bus boy brought the check. In addition, the food was awful. My wife and myself eat at numerous different asian restaraunts and I assure you, this was the worst asian cuisine we've ever experienced. The terriyaki chicken that I ordered was all dark meat and full of grissle. The taste of the sauce was nothing near what I consider to be terriyaki sauce. This place makes Kyoto Bowl look like a five star restaraunt. In addition, my wife woke up the next morning and was vomiting profusely. I am pretty sure she got food poisoning. I would strongly recommend to anyone wanting asian food, avoid this place like the plague. Especially if you're not Asian!!~~#~0
I love! Love! Love! Apple/Mac products, but when a cox tech came into my home accused me of killing their hard drive on their DVR and then went into my Mac laptop after this store put in a new opperating system a couple months before I thought they would support their product and not be a corporate butt kisser and side with cox. But minutes after the tech left I found the computer was left on, when I correctly logged off and turned off my computer and tried to turn the computer it would not boot-up. I then took my laptop to this store.  My laptop was in this stores trusted hand with their supposed geniuses and they could not even start up my laptop. Three days later I came in picked up my now dead computer and left. About a week later I went to the locally owned I-store and they started up mu laptop with a disc but I was told that my hard drive was dying. With still no support from the Corperate butt kissers I called apple tech support and asked if it was possible for a cox tech to kill my computer and finally got a semi-straight answer as it is possible. The moral of this review is that I will always buy Apple/Mac products because of their superior technology,  but will not trust their corporate minded  people to go to bat for me when it comes to them standing up against other corporations and not the people that they depend on for their bread and butter. I am disabled and can not afford to pay thousands of dollars for a replacement computer. I am on the other hand going to take cox communication to court. And I have never lost in any case I have brought to court!!!! Wish me luck.                                                    Suzanne Ciskowski~~#~0
tried to go there the other night and it was closed-they recently got into trouble hiring non-licensed therapists and all locations are shut down because of it~~#~0
This location has closed~~#~0
I had a sampler plate, beans and coleslaw.I don't know if it was the pink chicken on the sampler plate or the mayo in the coleslaw but I was serverely sick the next day.Don't think I'll be eating there again.~~#~0
The emperor has no clothes.  There.  I said it.  I had one the top 5 WORST dining experiences of my life eating at Durant's.  The food was average.  I had scallops that were slightly overcooked, poorly seasoned and somewhat gritty.  I tasted my fellow dining mates steaks and they were well below average compared to other steaks in this cost bracket (Flemings, Ruths Chris, Capital Grill).  And at $30 an entree I expect my food to be served without a side of attitude.  The service wasn't bad, it was offensive.  Our server was rude, sarcastic, flippant, and completely disrespectful. My husband actually got up halfway through the dinner to pull him aside and alert him that we were not happy with the service and to give him a chance to step it up.  We were quite polite and discrete about it.  The server proceeded to come back to the table and make jokes about this and announced sarcastically to the table that "he heard we were in a rush to get somewhere" and he was going to speed things up.  Um.  Wrong.  We weren't in a rush.  All we wanted was to enjoy our dinner.  It was bad enough I brought my parents to this place.  But I would have been truly mortified if I had brought a client here.  I will never go back.  If you have read my reviews, you know I am not prone to writing harsh reviews unless it is totally deserved. This one is.  Durants seems to be one of those old school restaurants that is skating by on its history and once-deserved reputation.  My advice?  Don't bother.  I can think of at least 5 other steak houses in the Valley where you will get a better meal for about the same or less money with far better service.Lets review:  expensive mediocre food, horrible service, loud chaotic atmosphere...  really?  Your still going to give it a try?  Okay, don't say I didn't warn you.~~#~0
This place was ridiculously slow tonight. I stopped for my yearly crave - the Shamrock Shake. To be honest, I have no idea why I love these, especially since I like REAL ice cream and shakes the old fashion way - but this minty green shakes have me hooked. My son also wanted one, but he wasn't quite sure he would like it so I asked if he could have a small taste of mine before they made his; however, they could not do that. Instead I had to buy my shake, move to the side while the order was rung through the POS and then filled and brought out to me. Once he decided if he liked it or wanted another flavor, we had to place another order and then pay for it.  I asked if I could just pay for a small shake and he would decide the flavor after he tasted my - NOPE. I was highly annoyed. I understand restaurant POS and the need to track inventory, but come on - it's a shake. Not only that ... it took over 10 minutes for 2 shakes and they weren't that busy. Unfortunately, I have been to this location on several times because it is close to the house. I typically don't eat the food, but my son loves McDonalds, so I stop for him. On numerous occasions they have messed up the order (he only eats plain burgers) and the service speed is extremely random, regardless of how busy they are. Sometimes it is awesome, other times it is horribly slow. I really don't like giving businesses a poor rating, but this last visit topped it off, and I had to share. I understand the machines are automated, but they could have rang up the shakes and then manually poored the correct flavor, it isn't rocket science, and it isn't going to through off their inventory!~~#~0
don't waste your money...tiny little pedicure room that's very close... not comfortable, nail tech was awlful polish cover cuticles and fingers.  no attempt was made to remove it.   polish bubbled up.  please don't waste your money!~~#~0
After agreeing to meet a friend here, as this was Her favorite spot. I showed up on the wrong "party" night. It was extremely loud and chaotic.I attempted to order a drink at the bar while I wait for Her, and with NO luck. We decided to go next door to another space.Perhaps you might want to try the space on a slower afternoon?~~#~0
From the poorly stocked shelves to the apathetic staff. Yeah, about the staff - it's OK to acknowledge the customer when they thank you. Staring at them doesn't cut it. Also talking ( let's be frank, BS-ing) with other employees when there is a line waiting for cashier assistance at self-checkout is not cool either.It might be a good policy for staff to leave cell phone in the locker while working. Seen the cart collectors jabbering away. Maybe this is why there never seems to be carts on-hand. I have noticed of late is that nobody seems to collect carts on a regular basis. When I was a teen and worked grocery, it was very important that carts be collected and available. Speaking of carts, they may wish to repair them as at least a third have locked wheels.What can you say? This store is poorly managed. They need to train staff better too. I have been going to this location for years, but find myself driving further and spending more to have a better shopping experience. That goes for the quality of produce as well.The skeevy customers don't seem to help. Opened products and people making themselves at home in the lawn chair area is a big turn off. Be sure to check the packaging for being tampered with, especially the beer. Walked out one time with a six pack of bottles that had a few nips taken out of three of them. Absolutely gross.Hate to sound like some old man ranting, but I really just need to go elsewhere.~~#~0
We thought we'd give this new place a try since we had a BOGO coupon to use.  My family loves fro yo, but this was not the place for us!  We sampled a couple of tastes, and could not get ourselves to enjoy it enough to make a bowl.  The fruit toppings looked disgusting- old and just sitting in juice.  The 1 employee working did welcome us in, but we had to walk out without a purchase because it was so awful.  This place is not going to last, especially being across from one of the best run, cleanest fro yo spots in the neighborhood- Kokomo!  We will not be returning.~~#~0
I would not recommend this place if it was the last place to stay at!! We needed a cheap month to month place while we were buying our house no contract .. What we should have done was rented a apartment for the four months (we ended up staying two and going to an apartment month to month for the other..... We were on the ground floor and at night needed to put a towel under the door because of the roach problem not to mention the notice from other guests.. We got one coffee pouch when we first checked in but When we asked for more they told us no and that the towels were only delivered once a week when they came to clean unless we went to front desk which was fine until our personal towels went missing and were replaced by theirs ... They never did find our towels ... And insisted we not be there when they cleaned our room... Hmm wonder why... I'll quit rambling save your money and stay else where or get a cheap month to month apartment!~~#~0
I figured there would be a bunch of college chicks drinking beer here. There was not. They had Left Hand Stout on draft which is alright. Where the hell were all of the college girls? I didn't get to creep any of them out!~~#~0
Really? Not very professional and merely sub par. Tiny and cramped salon. No top coats for finger nails or toes and no scrubbing the balls of my feet. (Which is why most of us GO get a pedicure) Seemed like they wanted to sell me some all natural products, while trying to pull me in with their "fun" personality. Sorry, I'm going back to Capri Nails!~~#~0
I was VERY disappointed!! When I moved to Scottsdale I was told not to go here because it was OVER PRICED and the staff was snobby.....a friend bought a Groupon and invited me so I thought why not...I'll give it a try. Our party was 2 adults and two very hungry kids. Well you all lived up to the rumor....the hostess was very rude and unprofessional. We did not have a resie...didn't think we needed one...it was 6PM on a Sat and she said; "Sorry we are booked"....there were tables open on the patio and we asked about those and she said that they were reserved. She did not even offer us a wait time or an alternative...she basically said..."sorry we are sold out until we close".....must have been ALL of the Groupon people redeeming their coupons! We thought, what are we chopped liver or something...must be nice to be able to turn biz away in THIS economy. We left and are going to get a refund for our Groupon - I have been in the restaurant biz for over 27 yrs and if I owned this place and knew that my hostess was turning away biz like that I would fire her so fast! I will NEVER go back. Oh....this was the kicker...as we left we asked a few of the tables on the patio if they had resies and they all said NO.....you all are a SAD excuse for a restaurant....take your Scottsdale flash and all of that money that you are making on that over priced sushi and RETRAIN your staff! I hate even giving it ONE star.....but there is no option for ZERO stars!~~#~0
It looks like all of the bogus orange head 5 star reviews couldn't save this place. I saw that the sign was no longer there and the place was closed for lunch on Friday.~~#~0
Yuck.Went here today for lunch.  The cashier didn't give me a receipt and I didn't remember the order number he mumbled at me.  I kept sending my husband up to check to see if the food being randomly handed out was ours, there was a huge group of people standing around also waiting for their food.  After almost 15 minutes our food finally was ready, although I can't understand the delay since neither one of us got any hot food that needed to be cooked.  The large Greek Salad ($5.50) I got was horrible.  It was dressed with a red wine vinagrette (???) and was inedible.  What a waste of money.  That was NOT a Greek Salad.My husband got the vegetable plate ($9.25) and choked down as much as he could.  The sole piece of Spanokopita (?) was mushy and soggy from sitting in a puddle of some red vinagrette dressing.  The Greek olives were mushy and the bread looked stale.  We picked at our food and finally threw it out in disgust.(We went to Circle K down the road and each got Hostess cupcakes to snack on instead.)YUCK!!  I won't be back~~#~0
Been there for lunch a couple of times. The first time I was not impressed, and rather neutral about the experience. But I thought it was because I was on the phone w/ biz the entire time. Went last week w/ a few folks from my office. Omg! We were thoroughly disappointed. Let's start w/ the chips and salsa. They serve a complementary salsa trio. Red, green and pico de gallo. The traditional salsa was borderline gross! No flavor and funky texture. The salsa verde was ok but not great. I asked for hot salsa....they didn't have one. Huh??! The food was par at best and the service was worse! The restaurant was not busy and we had to search for our server for any and everything. We had to ask for our check and 15 min later, she still hadn't come to collect the bill. Tick Tock! Tick Tock! C'mon lady....I've got stuff to do!!! I had to take the credit card to her!!! The icing on the cake was my asking for a to-go cup for my freshly poured iced tea. She brought me a soup container!! No thanks! Meh! I'm cool on this place!~~#~0
We hadn't been to Macayo's for awhile and I remember them being better than last night. Both of our foods, bean burro and chimi, were completely tasteless. Probably the worst burro or burrito I've ever had. Although, our server was great and the tortilla soup was good.  We usually have Mexican food 2-3 times a month and with how many mexican restaurants there are, we have many to choose from and Macayo's will not be one we return to.~~#~0
This restaurant was sooooo disappointing. My friends recommended it and it is right around the corner from my condo so I was excited to eat there. My mom and I went for lunch. The spring roll (tempura asparagus and mango) was mediocre and the sauce was bland. I asked for a side of peanut sauce hoping to help with the flavor. We ordered the Chicken Breast sandwich and the Saigon Bon salad. The server brought out the sndwich and it was fatty, grissley thigh meat and had absolutely no flavor. The sweet potato fries were the only saving grace with a homemade mayo. When the server set down the salad...I thought I was going to gag from the smell of rotten meat. The pork on the salad was disgusting and I immediately lost my appetite. The dressing was like pure rice vinegar with shredded carrot..again..NO FLAVOR.  I took the meat off the salad and ate the greens...totally lame. The sauces were boring and could have used a lot more flavor and spice. The meat tasted old and smelled like it too. I only could eat one bite. The service was decent...our iced tea remained full and everything was prompt with the exception of getting our sandwich order wrong.I will not eat there again as I am still gagging. I hope they will improve their food taste/quality as it is a really cute place.~~#~0
Why am I seduced by fast food sometimes? Is it because I work in a full service restaurant and can eat wonderful food anytime I want? Or because I crave something processed that's laden in grease and riddled with sodium? Or is it because my bf texts me and says hey, pick up arby's? I order the number five for bf and see a delicious looking sandwich staring at me. I mean what a photo! Who took this photo? Annie Leibovitz? It's perfect looking. Turkey and Swiss on some fresh looking bread with plump tomatoes and crisp lettuce. How bad can it be? Well. Hmmm. So bad. You spit it out in a napkin and scrape your tongue with a pumice stone. Gargle with Listerine and vow to the heavens to limit your fast food to In N Out and the Philadelphia Sandwich Company. Arby's Shmarby's. Gross.~~#~0
My flight got delayed for 4 hours and then once we got on the place we had to delay in the air for another hour. You tell me how great of service that is!~~#~0
Blows/reBlowsJust like Nine05 and Fate, this place will be closed down soon.  The only difference is that this place will close even faster.  Surprising really, because Fez and Switch are pretty good.  The food and service at Bliss was absolutely dreadful.  I sat down and asked the server what the Rotating tap of Sierra Nevada was.  He said "what's Sierra Nevada?, is that a beer?"   Where the hell did they find this server?  Are you serious?  How do you not know what Sierra Nevada is??  He goes to the bar to ask what it is, he comes back and says "its a brown ale, like octoberfest"  I ask: "Is it Tumble?"  He says, "oh yeah, thats what they called it."  Ok, how the hell do you forget the name of the beer from the bar to my table, its like 20 feet!  This server is the dumbest thing ever...  I hope this kid falls face first into the fryer.   Then we ask him how a few things are:  He says, "the burger is ok, thats my style."  Then he proceeds to tell me "Well, i sold a lot of this, and a lot of that."  Look sparky, i didnt ask how sales were, i want to know whats good.  If a parade of fools came in and ordered 200 poopwiches, that makes them a good seller, still doesnt make them good!  CaPish? I ordered the Veggie Sandwich... The eggplant was soggy, the bread was burnt (see my pic)...  the carrot slaw was SO covered in garlic crap, that it was not edible.  I didnt even eat a quarter of the food.  They cleared the plate without even asking how it was.  Seriously... i cannot fathom ever going back to this place.  I wish i could give this less than 1 star.... it deserves  a -5.  Epic Fail.~~#~0
I don't like to trash a place based on one bad employee, but I don't think I'll go back here.I went here with a friend. We place our order and sit down. A few minutes later, our waiter takes our drinks to a table across the room. This table realizes they have the wrong drinks and returns them to the counter. This is no big deal, I won't freak out over this. The waiter then brings the drinks (with the same straws used by the previous table) to my friend and me. I ask for new straws. The waiter then tells me "I just made these and I took the paper off of the straws." Why did he lie about this? I try not to make a scene, but he continues lying to me and refusing to just get two straws for a full five minutes before I reveal that I have watched where the drinks have been, I know that he did not "just make" them, and he was not the one handling the straws. He makes a scene and lays into me with a very sarcastic tone. I didn't eat too much of my meal. When your waiter lies about sanitary issues and mocks you in front of a crowd, your appetite goes away.This was probably my fifth or sixth visit to D'lish. In the past, the service has been okay and food is pretty good. But I have no problem with never eating here again.~~#~0
This place was terrible!  I came in here for the first time and they rushed throughout the whole service and was VERY rude when you asked them to correct something.  The guy who was doing my nails did not buff out my nails and only put nail polish on half of my nail.  I can understand mistakes can happen, however, being RUDE TO THE PAYING CUSTOMER IS INEXCUSABLE!!!! Here's a tip to the owner---TREAT YOUR CUSTOMERS BETTER & GET SOME TRAINING ON HOW TO GIVE PROPER MANICURES!!!!~~#~0
Went there last week. While the food was good, I was hungry less tha 2 hours later. Will not be back.~~#~0
Just awful. Way undercooked crust. It was supposed to be a thin crust but might have been an attempt at a "double dough". The crust was barely even dry, not a spot of browning anywhere.The "Sicilian Deep Dish"  was the same crust as the thin BUT they turned up the edges. Woo Hoo! NOT a deep dish. The mushrooms smelled like used socks. The The medium buffalo wings were tasty, but PLAIN wings. A little grease and hot sauce at the bottom. The delivery was over an hour when promised in 30 minutes. At over $50 for this meal I can only be grateful I don't have to order from them again. I'd rather have had a slice of white bread with a bottle of ragu and swiss. Yeah, that bad.What a shame. If you were a fan of the Zza's - the pizza place that used to be here - AVOID the new place at all costs!!~~#~0
i find this store creepy. it seems like the perfect place to witness the absolute worst side of human behavior (after violent riots and genocide, I mean). Any store that has a disclaimer sign out front, sternly warning customers not to run, shove, or steal from each other's carts, gets struck off my regular shopping list. You'd think those rules are just common decency, but apparently not at Last Chance.~~#~0
They really let me down....we have been a client at this Vet for a couple of years with our 2 dogs and 4 cats.  We take our pets for check ups and shots and havent had to go to them for an emergency.  Well an emergency came up.....my husband came home from work and found our elderly German Shepherd couldnt walk and the dog was very distressed.   We assumed he must have had a stroke or something.  While my husband was loading our dog into our car, I called Estrella Animal hospital to let them know we were coming in with an emergency and may have to put our dog down.    I was then told that it was a Friday and they are closing in 45 minutes and they could not see our dog.  I had explained we were regular clients, and also spoke with office mananager who told me the same thing.....I was shocked and greatly disappointed.   We were dealing with the potential loss of our beloved pet and were being told to take our dog elsewhere.  Well Estrella refered us to Goodyear Animal Hospital which is actually closer to our house, who was able to see our dog immediately.    I am so disappointed in the Estrella but I do thank you for referring us to Goodyear Animal hospital who now will have the business of our other 5 animals and they will be continuning with the care of our German Shepard who has brain tumors.~~#~0
We came here on New Years Day for a late lunch.  There were six of us.  The atmosphere was dark but clean if kind of out dated.  The service was indifferent but polite.  However, the food was terrible.  Nothing was hot enough and the quality was poor.  I'm sure the food temperature was well below safe limits.  I ate some of the food and am now feeling sick.  None of us will ever be back.  My recommendation?  Never eat here.~~#~0
I went to The Carwasher this morning to have my 2 month old BMW 650 cleaned and had a very unpleasant experience. I arrived and was greeted in the following way, "what's up boss?" I would not regard this as a professional greeting, but I am willing to look past it. I proceeded to purchase the more expensive of two wash options they offered for $11.99 which was considered "full service". I went through the tunnel and continued to the area where they hand dry and do a basic "detail". After 5 minutes of their "once over" on the car the manager called out "HEY" to let me know the car was done, again sub par professionalism. The car was still dripping wet, with no armor all on the tires, or utilization of the air hose to remove the water from the door jams etc. I said to the manager "are you sure you are done, last time I was here they applied armor all and dried the car completely". He said, can you usually get armor all applied for just $11.99 at other car washes?" By this time I was sensing his sarcastic arrogance and replied, "well 3 months ago I came here and received that service level and it was $4.00 cheaper at $7.99, and unless your armor all cost has increased by greater than $4.00 per car I would expect the same now, does that make sense to you?" His response was, "we are going to do you a favor and apply the armor all this time". He followed up by saying there were upgrade options above the "full service" level (that I was never made aware of at purchase by the way) that include armor all etc, and I only got the "basic service". I then proceeded to point to the roadside sign that clearly depicts "full service" - $11.99, "basic service" - $5.99, showed him my receipt that says "full service" and finally he was speechless. Customer service is paramount in this tough economy where competition is fierce between companies, it would be in your best interest to address these staffing concerns before you lose additional customers to the competition! Bottom line, if you are going to charge top dollar for a car wash, make sure you are at least offering a parallel service as your competitors. I will NOT be coming back here again as a result of their lack of customer appreciation, and abusive customer treatment!~~#~0
We order 2 plates chilly chicken, but it was so hard to find chicken in it.  They cooked it with 75% of onions,  capsicum and 25% of chicken.  They should change dish name, it should be "chilly capsicum" instead of "chilly chicken".  Worst dish!!! Don't ever order chilly chicken here.~~#~0
It takes a lot for me to write a negative review.I decided to stop here for a quick Wednesday night dinner. It was busy, but not a friday night busy sort of evening.We opted to sit out on the patio-once we were seated, is where my experience at Half Moon went sour. We sat there for at least 10 min before someone came to take our drink order. Our waitress disappeared, and it took another 15 min for her to reappear with our drinks. I'm annoyed at this point..25 min just to get my drinks and you havn't even taken my order?!In that time..about 3 other tables fill on that patio..those same 3 people get up and walk out because of the lack of service.Our appetizer finally arrive i(we've now been there for 45 min), and I say "I was wondering if we were forgotten", and the food runner then decides to YELL AT ME. Yes, me, the customer. The customer who has been waiting close to an HOUR for a sandwich and a soda.He screams at me, and I quote, "LOOK-the upper floor is packed, and we can cook only so much at a time"...and storms off.What just happened here?! Did that employee seriously yell at me and try to school me on the workings of a restaurant?! We had been sitting there for so long that by the time we would have left, we would have been stuck waiting elsewhere anyway.I couldnt believe the complete lack of service, courtesy, and the outright  rude employee, who needs a serious training course on customer service.We ate our meal..chuckled at how insane it all was..the 'upper deck' is a 2 step elevated section inside so we had a good laugh at that too.To top off the miserable experience, the food was below mediocre Over cooked, the cole slaw was awful, and we kissed any chance of our drinks being refreshed goodbye. It was like we were the exiles on a deserted island begging for a beverage. Half Moon will never see my hard earned pennies again. I'd rather run down the street to Sonic!!!!~~#~0
Friday, December 28.  Kitchen closed at 7:00 PM!  Why even open?~~#~0
Canned sauce, canned everything, mushy doughy dough. Blech. Garbage.I have always been amazed that for years all the Barro's locations seem to rake in far more dough then they deserve considering the food is so darn mediocre.This cardboard is one step above frozen - barely.These are the conveyor belt pizzas that bite the dust - they don't taste yummy either. Where is Lucille Ball and Ethyl when you need them! Some reviewers seem to like these pies because they remind them of their childhoods. OK, well maybe your photo album would taste better with a little canned sauce and packaged mozzarella cheese on it?If Phoenicians think these pies are the bomb, then maybe it has something to do with the wacky politics here - I dunno. I don't get it?Am I being a pizza snob? MaybeLook, if you have super low expectations and compare these on a par with Dominos or Pizza Hut, then these might be considered fantastic pies by comparison.For my taste, I try to stay stay away from any Barros anywhere. Yuck.~~#~0
This has been a hard year for many business' and it especially shows here. I haven't gone as much as I used to since it seemed like each time they were out of something. This is an issue considering the menu is already limited. My most recent and last visit, there was almost no meat on my torta. We ordered some chips and guacomole with our food and it was just enough to feel satisfied, but over priced since it lacked meat.~~#~0
My girlfriend and I went to see a move there last night and were greatly disappointed with the management.  We walked into a movie where it was literally just us and one other guy in the back of the theatre.  This was a horror movie and a couple of times my girlfriend "yelped" lol.  This guy gets really upset by her screams and tells her to shut up, and when I tell him to calm down, he goes and tells the manager I threatened him and that me and my girlfriend, are "disrupting the whole theatre.  A theatre full of three people.  The manager comes to my girlfriend and I,  and tells us we need to leave if we can't be quiet but when we try to tell him this jerk has been verbally assaulting us since we arrived, he throws us out of the movie theatre without even an apology.  The jerk in the theatre actually laughed at us as we were escorted out while the manager said nothing. The theatre is run down and tiny to top it all off which should have been my first clue.  This was a favorite theatre of my mine in north scottsdale when I was a teenager but, Shea 14 had it's glory over 10 years ago, now it's just a cesspool for late night drunks and lousy inexperienced management.   My advice to everyone is to avoid this drunken hobo pit and go to an AMC; AMC seems to have more professional management than HARKINS, especially if you want to weed out the unprofessional managers and creeps who wander into movie theaters late at night with nothing better to do.~~#~0
If you live in Phoenix and want to climb in the A/C the summer your kinda stuck with this place. There is too much of a stuffy corporate feel here to have any fun. Good place for kids b-day party. Go make use of the great nearby climbs that the Phoenix are has to offer.Its FREE!~~#~0
Mike helped us this evening and I must say not much personality but great service. We went in to activate our new iPhone 5 and it took all of 15 minutes but then.... We tested the phone before walking out and it wouldn't ring.   Not Mikes fault!  Now he is activating another new one lol. Good attitude though.    Well let me correct this completely!  Now the good attitude is going sour. The computer is telling him he can't make the phone change until Friday, Black Friday no less due to a system error.  His manager, Jessica I believe wants nothing to do with this and ignores us.  Now we have been sent away with a out of the box failure that they won't deal with because a machine says they can't.  Seriously, doesn't anyone have brain there? Have they heard of customer service?Off the San Tan location where the Manager Tim was amazing and immediately took care of our problem and made it clear a that the Verizon n problem shouldn't be our problem.  Verizon at San Tan , You Rock.  Verizon Germann and Gilbert we recommend no one go there!!~~#~0
The first time I ate here last year I would have given them 5 stars, but tonight they got 1 star for the following reasons.1. It took over an hour to get our appetizer and food.  Our appetizer came out only moments before our food.2. It took another 45 mins to get our check and leave3. The waiter barely touched our tableThe only plus is that complaining to the manager is that we got our appetizer comped.Needless to say we're never coming back.~~#~0
Use to go here alot growing up but stopped when I ordered a huge amount of spring rolls for a work pot luck.  People were excited as they knew what spring rolls were. They cut it in half for me but when we opened it, there were tiny ants crawling out of the noodles!  I proceeded to contact the food inspection authorities and found other complaints on their website from the general public.  I can't believe I had been eating here for the last 10+ years even when they had no AC (one summer) or would sometime run out of the dish that I ordered!  I'm Vietnamese so I have gone to plenty of hole-in-the-wall restaurants and they were great and so was Da Vang until my incident and reading those other complaints.  My appetite is gone for them.~~#~0
I must say, I just got a new job and was looking to treat myself to a nice lunch and was not to impressed with the food. Especially at that price point. Yes the atmosphere was good and so on. But I would advise to stick to the drinks unless you are into hyped up scenes with no delivery.~~#~0
Horrible wait. Horrible service. First and last time will ever patronize.~~#~0
I will not be returning.This is place used to have the best beer in town. I got their summer honey ale and it was bitter. Service was slow, spotty, and their classic mac & cheese recipe has been changes. It was a goopy mess that I did not finish.Everything has changed so much. I won't be returning.~~#~0
it was girls night out - dinner before going to see chelsea handler perform at comerica theatre.first thought as we entered was the place was quaint, clean, good music, and empty - we were the second table to be sat for dinner at 5:15.    we ordered drinks - all rum, by the way - a couple of the gals were shocked that a rum bar didn't serve vodka, so we were off to a great start....My Mojito Ponganot was amazing and that is the only good thing I have left to say about this place.we ordered appetizers: the oven roasted plantains - just meh and we also ordered the fresh baked patty - one tilapia and one spinach. I thought the crust was a bit on the dry side - two of us 4 thought they were good - good enough to order another one - which ended up never being served to us.the major disappointment was the one entree that we made this trip for was "sold out"  - hmmm   we were the second table to be seated - the other table hadn't ordered yet and what is it you ask that they "sold out" of - why the popcho & sweet ginger - basically baby bok choy - wow now that is an ingredient you can't find oh, i don't know EVERYWHERE.....???   we ended up eating salads - which were good, fresh, but frankly could have made just as easily at home.   the bread that was offered and not on menu and therefore assumed to come with the meal was breadsticks with a hint of vanilla - good, but 2 sticks for almost $5 - no thanks. the kicker was when we asked them to call us a cab...we sat for 10 minutes and nothing - we asked again and finally this time saw them pick up a phone.   we were then told we could sit outside to free up the table - this was after paying our $200 tab.  I have never had this occur at a restaurant.  yes, i know it was a friday night, but we were finishing our drinks, we had paid and tipped WELL and think that they could afford to have us sit there for 10 minutes waiting on a cab they forgot to call.I "might" have returned even based on the lackluster food - just for the drink, but I can certainly say after the rudeness we would never return~~#~0
This is in my neighborhood and I heard good things so I decided to give it a shot. The place is not recommended dine in as it gives me the feeling of an indoor version of one of them mobile food wagons with some fold out benches setup. We ordered some carne asada tacos and some guacamole and chips and a few bottled cokes I believe.  The carne asada tacos portion of meat inside was small and the portions of guacamole,cabbage, and onions outweighed the 10 miniscule pieces of meat inside. The taco had almost a hint of peanut butter taste to the guacamole inside the tacos and dip which is disgusting. I am not sure if it was the crazy amount of cabbage that caused the taste but pretty gross. I am completely stunned how anyone can actually like the tacos or guacamole here as even chains like Rubio's have better street tacos(they aren't too shabby actually).Service: 5/5 they were nice and promptAmbiance: definitely take out unless you like picnicsparking: pretty terrible if I recallfood: 0/5 worst tacos I have ever had, guacamole also. I don't mean to be jaded but it was a terrible experienceThere isn't many options so I didn't try too much here on the visit with my girlfriend and kid but I won't be going back and still don't know how in the world this could ever be ranked in any food critics reviews.~~#~0
Saw this place on "Check Please" and the reviews looked awesome so when we were in the area I begged my husband to take me! I was super excited when we pulled up but we got there a little early and ended up having to wait for the owner to open up. I walked into the cashier blocking off the dining area, when I tried to get his attention he practically jumped at me telling me that the dining room was closed. (like there should have been a huge DO NOT ENTER sign at the entrance) OK..... so when I ask him when its open he says "to go only" another OK .... when I walk up to order he says "but the kitchen won't be ready for an hour" AN HOUR?!?! its 11, most restaurants are ready to serve food at 11, you want me to wait an hour?? NOI really did want to try the food at this place, but quite frankly I'm not willing to give any of my hard earned money to a restaurant that is going to be rude and unhelpful.  I don't care how good ppl say their food is.. no thank you!~~#~0
Again, more issues from the employee with an attitude, Assi.  This time tried to fool my wife into thinking that Subway had closed early.  The current time was 8:45pm and they close at 10pm.  No respect and continued to treat my wife in a belittling way.  Is there a number I can call to fix this poor customer service???~~#~0
SHOCKINGLY DISAPPOINTING AND DIRTY....STAY AWAY. My husband and I had been to the Montelucia Resort several times at night for the bar and once for dinner and loved it. It was classy, upscale and has gorgeous grounds which look lovely at night. I decided to try the spa, expecting another wonderful experience. My trip to the Joya Spa was shockingly disppointing. First, I called Friday morning for a pedicure appointment and was told I could come in about two hours, and then asked for a credit card to hold the time slot. I gave it and immediately after was told the appointment was "not cancellable". I have no problem with such a policy, what I have a problem with is not being told this BEFORE I book it. Not a great start. I arrived about a half hour early and was told to sit in the lobby, which consisted of two chairs and a couch and an empty table. The furniture was filty and the teal blue rug looked like it hadn't been vacuumed in a month. There were no magazines on the table, and I was not offered anything to drink/nibble on...not even water, but they made sure I was invited to browse in their "boutique" directly facing the seating area. I was never offered anything and fnally got up to wander and found a magazine to read in the hair area. If you don't like men in the spa when you go you won't like this place. Men were everywhere,including two heavily tattooed, shirtless and barefoot who walked down the stairs and out the front door. There were also alot of workmen wandering around in workclothes with big rings of keys on their hip. The place felt more like a subway station than a spa, but when I went to the pedicure area, it got worse. The place was filthy. There was a dirty used Kleenex on the table next to my chair and the tables were dirty and stained with layers of old product. The floor around my chair was black with what looked like old mud. I had to ask to have the dirty Kleenex taken away. The towels were old and dingy. I couldnt leave because of their non-cancellation policy, so stayed for the peddie, which was fine. The service itself was adequate, but the surroundings so dirty and low-end it ruined the experience. When I checked out, they announced that they had added a 20% gratuity, but I guess when they saw the look on my face, they quickly added that it could be adjusted. Wow, what nerve. At no time was I asked how I liked my visit or service. I am still in shock that a resort that costs as much as this one has a spa this disgusting. If you are planning a stay and are looking forward to luxurious, upscale spa treatments, think again. I have received better treatment at much cheaper places like 20Lounge than I did here.~~#~0
This goes for any Walmart located anywhere. This company is the most disgusting, inhumane company around. If you shop here you should be ashamed, by supporting this company you support child abuse, unfair wages, and discrimination.They are raping America and the world.~~#~0
I stopped in one day when I first moved here and sampled a couple of things, the chicken teriyaki, the fried gyoza, and some kind of drink. Nothing was fresh, everything tasted like old fryer grease or freezerburn (except my drink). To their credit, the service was immaculate. The women who helped me was super friendly and made suggestions of things I should try on my next visit (when pigs fly). I am really amazed by the positive reviews here. Unfortunately, this place is just a couple blocks from my house so I have to deal with the nasty stench from their deep fryer when I walk to the lightrail on my way to work.~~#~0
Nothing like a place that perpetuates the sterotype of a poorly run office.  Making a long story short....we had an injury to our son...we signed in and NOBODY looked at him for 20 minutes, despite crying in pain. We were relieved when the door finally opened, but they actually called a happy little girl back first, who arrived after us, and was seemingly carefree.Nobody explained...nobody checked us...nobody communicated anything.  We went to the ER at Scottsdale Healthcare and had a great experience.One overworked PA, 3 other non-caring staff.  No traige.  This is not urgent care...it's barely a functioning doctor's office. Pass on them in the future.~~#~0
This is another bottom feeder collection law firm who only works for homeowners associations and makes their money by pursuing leans against honest homeowners who were the victims of bylaws or administrative errors by their clients, the homeowners associations.  If you happen to be in their office in person, check them for a pulse because these guys are heartless.  What a bunch of obstinate douche bags!~~#~0
One word TERRIBLE~~#~0
This would be the perfect place to see a bunch of old broads crowing about the Sex and The City movie, comparing themselves to fictional, empty, pathetic, meaningless women, and guffawing over a disappointing assortment of wines about how the sequel better show a full-frontal of Big (unless the first film had it, I wouldn't know.  *shrug*)The only thing more of a headache than Old Town Scottsdale is Old Money Scottsdale.Skip it unless you are an old broad or have future aspirations to become one.The service sucks too.~~#~0
This palce is SO hit or miss, and unfortunately mostly miss.  I've given it more tries than any normal person would with so many terrible experiences.  Ben the owner is a nice guy with good intentions and that's why I keep coming.  But good intentions does not a good establishment make.  Good intentions and $1.25 will get you a ride on the bus, and that's about it.If ever I had the authority to give a place 1 star, this is the place.  Out of 6 times here, 2 have been decent at best and 4 absolutely horrible.  Most of the time there is barely any service in the bar, the bartender (and the waitresses as well) will just disappear for long stretches of time.  Don't be surprised to be overcharged for any particular drink.  Don't be surprised if you are sitting at one of the tables in the bar and you have to bus your own empties.  Don't be surprised if they run out of any type of beverage, food, glassware, or even change at the bar (seriously, how do you not stock change of a $20 bill?).  If you get a message on a Friday to check out Sunsets on the roofdeck, don't be surprised when you get there and the roof is closed (and I'm talking closed for a private party and not due to fire code violations).  Don't be surprised to be handed menus and then have no one take your order. . .for over an hour.  Don't be surprised when dining in the restaurant if something you ordered never shows up, or if an app or salad shows up after your entree.Ugh.  I allowed 4 strikes for C4, but now you're out for good.~~#~0
HOW does this place have an average of 3 stars???  I am giving one star because there's no way to go any lower!  Eeek!I have lived in PHX for more or less 25 years.  It's been at least 22 since I've been into a Big Apple and now I remember why.There was a large group of us - and we came in at staggered times.  I know this is a hassle for the server - as she got the orders technically correct and all the seperate checks were accurate, I will say our server, Juanita, was completely acceptable.  I would say I prefer my servers to have all their key teeth - but that's just snobby and irrelevant to the service, so I'll let it go.Food - the value here would be great for a steakhouse - if it was good. The zucchini app for the table was A-OK.  It's a mountain of sliced breaded and fried zuc - and it was fried right and served piping hot.The salad dressings threw me off a bit.  No regular Italian or Balsamic Vinaigrette - but a RASPBERRY vinaigrette?  At a value steakhouse?  The French dressing is a CINNAMON French.  Not bad...but I'm not a fan of dessert flavored iceberg lettuce. :)For entree, I chose the ribeye with baked potato.  The potato was fine.  I wish I could say the same about the meat - but I still can't figure out how they managed to make a rib eye tasteless.  It was on the rare side of the medium rare I ordered - and with that much fat, it should have been delicious. But, no.  Not a morsel of flavor to be found in the whole 12oz serving.  (Half was consumed for next day lunch - the extra aging didn't help. :)  In fact - my dog wasn't even impressed.)Nothing wrong with the corn on the cob - as long as it's cooked I think that's hard to mess up.  I am guessing the baked beans were ok  - some people must like the cloyingly sweet 3 parts brown sugar to 1 part bean recipe.  Personally, I am not a fan, so I didn't enjoy them.The decor is cowboy steakhouse.  Very similar to any other cowboy steakhouse.  (LoneStar, Texaz Roadhouse, etc.)  But - that brings us to the restroom.  Parents - shield your children!Nature called, so I went to check out the restrooms.  I understand sometimes old plumbing allows odors to linger that newer buildings don't have issues with.  As I walked the hall toward the restroom doors, the outhouse smell grew with each step.Once in the ladies' room, the smell was almost noxious.  I know it's clean and germ free in there - as the smell of bleach competed with the sewage smell.  As I became nauseated, I pondered if I'd be able to hold my breath until I was finished, put back together and hand washed.  I even considered skipping washing my hands, as we did have wet naps on the table.  Anything to get out of there faster!  (I did wash my hands, but didn't take time to dry them, and re-zipped and buttoned my jeans as I was walkling back the outhouse stinking hallway back to the dining room.)I've heard it mentioned that everyone has thier own personal hell - not necessarily the fire and brimstone depictions.  If this is true, I will do my best to be a good girl the rest of my life - I am afraid this place with it's stink restrooms, tasteless meat and strange "mordern" salad dressings (strange for an old fashioned cowboy steakshouse, anyway) may very well be the hell I'd be sent to if my  good deeds didn't add up at final judgement.~~#~0
The owner is the exact opposite of our experience with Thai people. Horribly rude man. Will never go back. Even though the food was pretty decent.~~#~0
I am done with the Armitage. I have been here several times over the past few years and other than being overpriced, the food and service was always good. A couple of months ago, we went there for a birthday lunch. I ordered the Garden Veggie Pita. How can one mess up a veggie sandwich? How about putting it on a stale pita bread that cracks in two when you pick it up. Since it was my B-Day I didn't want to make any comments, especially since I wasn't the one paying. A couple of weeks ago we went there on a Sunday. I ordered the beef and Gorgonzola melt and my partner ordered a burger medium rare. When the plates were delivered I noticed that the slices of sirloin resembled small chunky pieces of beef jerky, the mushrooms were dry and shriveled and the Gorgonzola melt part looked like a wipe of mayo. I have had this before and the sirloin was always juicy and tender, on the medium rare side. I brought this to the servers attention who immediately said "that's how it's made." I told him that I've had it before and it definitely did not resemble my prior visits. No comment from the server. I ate it since at that point I didn't want to make a scene and it was horrid. My partner's "medium-well" burger was very well done. She decided not to complain due to the fact that we don't really see what goes on in kitchens when we complain, do we? We didn't have an opportunity to even let the server know we were disappointed, since we didn't see him until the end of the meal. At that point, we made it clear that we were very disappointed, and showed him the doneness of the burger. I reiterated how horrible the beef jerky sandwich was and he then offered to comp. We settled on a free dessert. He also gave us coupons which was a nice gesture. Too bad he didn't listen to me the first time... To the owner: when a repeat customer says he had something before, and that there is now something wrong, have your people pay attention. Don't make excuses for an incompetent kitchen. However, based on what your staff said, IF it is now your intention to provide an overdone dried out sliced sirloin sandwich, and  to overcook burgers regardless of the order, then you have no business in the food business. If not, then you better get in that kitchen and fix it, because this sort of news travels fast in my community. In my book, two strikes and you are out. Sorry but there are better choices out there, and if I am going to spend 100 bucks on lunch it better be damn good. You're just not good anymore. I will not be back.~~#~0
The worst fish and chips I have ever had.  Do yourself a favor...go to Fry's, buy a box of Gorton's fish fillets (the square ones) and take it home and deep fry it.  Then mix some ketchup with some cocktail sauce (NO TARTAR SAUCE....THEY DON'T HAVE TARTAR SAUCE!!) and you have the Pete's experience, and you save about $15. I can't believe people think this is good.  They make Long John Silvers seem gourmet. Dang.~~#~0
I took my parents to Bavarian Point on word of mouth. I should have used YELP!   I am sad to report that this was the worst experience I've ever had. From the moment we walked in - there was a lack of attention. I honestly thought it was a seat yourself type of place, because there was NO ONE, NO ONE in the front to great you. Now, I've never been to a German restaurant and it can be a bit overwhelming. I don't know what the hell to order! It made it worse that the menu was in German, I get that I am in a German place, but last I knew - we aren't taught German in school and when the person came around to take our order, I swear it was at least 30 min. Terrible!  While we were waiting for our mystery food my mom found a baby roach on the table! She trapped it under her water glass that was empty, due to lack of service - but THAT WAS IT!  We walked out - we had to... All I can say is Good Luck to you if you eat there! May there not be any roaches in your food or table!PROST!~~#~0
Sucks! RUDE RECEPTIONIST AT ENTRANCE. Totally disrespected man in wheelchair needing extra help! Long wait, voting hand sanitizer for sure!~~#~0
I ordered a Chicken Focaccia and got a Chicken Wrap with a side of attitude.Glad to see another sports bar by work so my coworkers and I headed there for lunch. The place was busy, as it was the lunch hour and it looked like the TV section at Best Buy. I asked our server if she wouldn't mind having our orders on separate checks. Her response:"I'm not obligated to do it so if I have time, I'll do it."What I wanted to say to her:"Bitch, please!"I ordered a Chicken Focaccia and when I got my order, it was a wrap. Since all my coworkers started eating and she was no where in sight, I just ate it. When she came around, I asked her if this was supposed to be a sandwich:Her response:Well, this is our version of focaccia. The wrap is like a thin pita bread quesadilla thing. Its not focaccia. Its our version. I thought you knew because you come here all the time. Well... do you like it?Firstly, this was my first time but I must look like I eat here all the time.What I wanted to say to her:"Bitch, please!"The wrap was basically chicken chunks, mayonnaise and a pita bread quesadilla thing. Whatever that means. It was gross. If I wasn't there with a bunch of other people, I probably would have sent it back but we were all on our lunch break together. For my first visit, you get one star for poor service and not knowing what focaccia is.~~#~0
Very dissatisfied with the customer service...I frequently eat at smash burger and every time I order half regular fries half sweet potato fries and it has never been a problem. Today on the other hand, the manager explained that it was difficult to be done and tried giving me a lecture. It made me feel as if I were an inconvienence.  IT'S ALL ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICE, an additional amount if necessary would of been fine. I WILL NEVER GO BACK and speak all negative things when asked. Smash Burger, I expect a response if you would like to rectify this situation and have a good patron return.~~#~0
Gone Forever...And not terribly disappointed.~~#~0
MMy wife suggested we try this place instead of our regular Chinese buffet (Fugi's). Boy, was I disappointed! The girl at the cash register (you pay before you are seated) was more interested in an iPad than in taking our money). After being seated I headed for the buffet line and found the "Habachi"....oops! It was a flattop grill and a gas grill, no charcoal! Stir fry done on a flattop is not stirfry! Then on to the steam table...ALL the food was mediocre at best...bland and unseasonably. The sushi was horrible...tasted like the refrigerator. The salad bar had a minimum of items and the lettuce looked like it had been there all day. Although the price was $9.99,they did offer a 10% discount for seniors, which I asked for and then was charged the full price anyway. The waitstaff were aloof and could have cared less if we were even there. I for one will not go back and will gladly pay the $12 I usually pay at Fugi's for better quality!~~#~0
I to really wanted to like the place. It seems to have a lot of cars in the lot when I go by so I stopped in tonight at 6:30 on a Friday. There were not that many tables occupied but the stools at the bar were full. I walked up to the bar and ordered a Vodka Collins and asked for a menu. I was thrown off guard when the bartender asked me what that was! I told her how to make the drink. Which was served in the wrong type of glass and without a garnish!  I decided then that $4 was all this place was getting from me!  I am so sick of bars hiring untrained bartenders because they think a cute girl or guy is all that is required. Well I'm not gay and I don't like girls so this doesn't work for me. And the guys usually don' appeal to me either if they are clueless.I don't tip the clueless. That's my new motto.The drink still was not up to par so I sucked it down and called it a night.As for the rest of the service; I was asked by 3 waitresses if I would like to order since I had a menu in the 29 minutes I was there, but when I first came in I could not find one.The menu was not very appealing so I probably will never return.~~#~0
I need to deduct another star for their use of styrofoam cups.  Green definitely it's not.~~#~0
Went in today with a yelp deal on my phone. They would only except printed deals. Even though i had a conformation number. Food is average at best. Probably won't go back.~~#~0
Poor experience over the course of 3 visits.  Staff is friendly however they do not seem to be focused exclusively on customer service, as their personal conversations amongst each other appear to take priority.  Orders take much too long to arrive, wings are soft and void of any crisp,and  food is  over priced and lacks a developed value.  On a positive note, the GM offered to make an attempt to remedy the situation which I have yet to take him up on.~~#~0
There was only one item that I would come here for once in a blue moon and that was their 99¢ double stack. I am not a frequent fast food connoisseur and don't eat it on the regular but the double stack was one of the only exceptions I would make every so often. Well they have taken it off their value menu and raised it to $1.79 and officially made it easy for me to never step foot in a Wendys again. It's just not that good to pay any more for.  They also reduced the nuggets to 4 pieces instead of 5.  And they increased the price of their small chili to $1.49.  I will miss your value meals and dollar double stack and your beautiful red pigtails Wendy. RIP Dave Thomas.~~#~0
All I'm going to say about this place is that I've seen the workers multiple times in the trash area at Kierland Commons storing/preparing food back there. Items included lettuce heads, breads, and macaroni and cheese. DISGUSTING. I'm not making this up.  Unfortunately, I contacted Health Services about this, and when someone came to inspect the trash area there was no food back there.(I, along with co-workers, noticed this on the daily back in high school when I worked at Cold Stone).~~#~0
Won't be going back.The food was so so.  The Front of the House was a disaster.We arrived early.  With no real bar area we were taken out back to the fire pit area and told a server would be a long to get us drinks.  After waiting 15 minutes, I went in and ordered myself.We were eventually seated 30 minutes after our reservation.  They were then out of the entree I had chosen.The courses came very slowly.  We had to send back my wife's entree as it was undercooked.The only highlight was the pasta dish.There are many better choices out there.~~#~0
Dear Denny's @ Scottsdale & Shea, I am very regretful to reform you that your restaurant is repulsive. Your hours, although appealing to the party animal which escapes from me from 11 PM - 4 AM, is not enough to make me return here again. Your food is, quite frankly, disgusting. I'm not sure where throughout the years the "Slam" in the supposedly infamous GrandSlam has gone, but I experienced a grand piece of crap on a plate.P.S. - please hire prettier / friendlier / more enthusiastic waitresses. Love, Wesley.~~#~0
I'd like to begin this review with a warning...WARNING: Oscar the Grouch works at this location! I pull up to the drive-thru at 5am this morning to order a drink for me and my friend. Little miss Grouchy gets on the other end full of attitude and scorn. She asks for my order and interrupts me as I am in the middle of my statement saying "is that all?" with a snappy tone. Which completely throws me off, I finish my order but can't believe her tone the whole time she is talking with me. I drive around to the window and she got my drink wrong! (maybe she should have LISTENED to the whole thing...any ways I hand back my drink so she can make another one and she slams the drink into the trash and refuses to look at me. She maintains a permanent scorn on her face and when she finally hands me my corrected drink, I say, "thanks, have a good morning." she slams the window on me! I don't have the highest expectations for any drive-thru, but Starbucks always promotes their friendly service and my experiences at other Starbucks have always been pleasent; so I am shocked this Starbucks is still open. When those 100 odd stores closed a few years ago, this one should have been one of them.This isn't the first time I have come to this location and had to correct my order at the window, in fact getting my order RIGHT is an exception! I can't believe a company like Starbucks would have stand for such low quality in service.~~#~0
Called about a BEAM vacuum part...don't waste your time with them.  They said they would order the part but couldn't guarantee the color, etc., there supplier would send...I called again over two weeks later and they still hadn't placed an order with their parts supplier.  I got on line with a Central Vacuum Store and the part will be here in 3 days...less expensively I might add.  I had to select a star or I would have given a ZERO rating.~~#~0
Do not waste your money in this restaurant!! My family and I went to Grapes tonight based on the reviews that were written here, and honestly I have no idea why everyone rated this place so highly. Four stars?? Really?? First of all it took about 10 minutes for anyone to acknowledge the fact that we had entered the restaurant. After being seated next to the front window it was gross to turn around and see the front window full of bugs crawling around trying to find their way out. Close the door, tis the season for insects!! Gross. Now, for the food...there was nothing good about the food. This place is below average, starting from the half burnt pizza bread that we had to ask for several times to the Osso Bucco that my husband had. The Shrimp Fra Diavalo was bad, and by bad I don't mean prepared badly I mean the shrimp was bad! My Chicken Limone was below average, and even my children were not crazy about the Spaghetti Bolognese they had. I have to say this was an all around disappointment and waste of money, I would be surprised to see this restaurant still in business next year.~~#~0
Given that this restaurant was 1/4 full on one of the busiest weekends (July 4) should have been a warning sign. We made reservations for 6:45 PM and were seated next to a table of 20 people with screaming kids (I am as mad with myself for not asking for another table as I am with the airhead hostess for seating us there). Given that there were more employees at the restaurant than patrons, I don't understand why the service was so poor. When we sat down they did the usual up-sell on bottled water (attention all restaurants -- this is getting ANNOYING) and we asked for "tap water" and I ordered a prickly pear frozen Margarita no salt. What arrived was a Margarita WITH salt. Given there was straw I went ahead and started drinking it, but within 60 seconds the waiter came to prepare the "table side guacamole" and he asked me if I liked the drink and I said it was OK but they went ahead and put salt on it. His response? "OK" ... note to management, when either your bartender or waitstaff screw up should they not try to make amends? Given that I've had "table side guacamole" at much cheaper places, like El Torito Grill, I expected something more than bringing a bowl with all the ingredients and the waiter standing there mixing them --- no explanation of WHAT the ingredients were or if we wanted this or that in the guacamole --- so why say "table side" when it might as well have been done in the kitchen? And to top it off I had to ask the waiter about the two hot sauces; e.g. what were they, were they hot or mild, etc. The guacamole was OK, not the best and it was EXTREMELY salty. My guest and I couldn't figure out why. My guest ordered the Filet with Cheese enchiladas and I ordered the "tres tacos". My tacos were probably an appetizer but I wasn't that hungry and quite honestly nothing on the menu looked that great. They also had an all-you-can-eat buffet for $29 but to my guest and myself it looked like a glorified taco bar (with a nasty looking roasted whole suckling pig in the middle -- I'm sorry, when I see something that could possibly be someones pet roasted whole on a platter it doesn't make my mouth water). My three tacos were one pork which was so hot I had to take a Pepcid AC after the meal, a chicken taco that was quite good and a steak carnitas taco that was smothered in the sweetest tasting BBQ sauce I've ever had --- that one I skipped after the first bite. In the meantime, table with all the brats (why do parents allow this?) kept getting louder, my guest's steak and enchiladas came. He ordered the steak medium rare and what came was somewhere between medium well and well done. The waiter was actually standing behind me when I saw my guest cut the steak in half and looked in shock at how well done it was. Before I could say "send it back NOW" the waiter said, ohh, that looks well done to me. So he took it back but offered NOTHING given that I was done with my meal by the time the next steak came which was BLOODY RARE. My guest and I had headaches from the screaming children and just wanted to get the hell out of there so he ate most of the steak but left the most bloody rare pieces for the kitchen staff to see when the plates were returned to the kitchen. We waited forever for the check and the waiter didn't take anything off the bill or even offer a free desert. I left a 10% tip and will NEVER be back.~~#~0
Ok, I'm a dude that likes meat and cheese, so, hey, sandwich with meat and cheese should be pretty awesome, right?  I love Chicago-style Italian Beef, and this is kinda similar components.  So why is the Italian Beef so delicious and the Philly Cheesesteak so repugnant?  Wiz.Blech, blech, blech, blech.  Whoever invented Cheez Wiz needs to be punched right in the balls and made to refund the $10 it cost for this sandwich.~~#~0
Wow how things must have changed.  I couldn't disagree with these reviews more.  First off, you walk in and it not only looks old and dated, it is extremely dark and feels dirty.  I'm not saying it is dirty, but it feels like one of those chineses resturants that seems like the last time they did anything to it, was when it was built.  There are stains all over the cielings. There is no privacy in the various chairs and everyone can see and hear what is going on during your procedure; I was very uncomfortable. This is the only dentists I ever went to that didn't give me a toothbrush!  As far as administartively, they are lacking in that area too.~~#~0
This is the first restaurant that I have seen that is open until exactly 9:15pm. It is an odd closing time and maybe they were in a rush at 8:45pm packing my to-go order because my two spring rolls at $2 were left out. The dipping sauce for those spring rolls were in there and that ended up getting dumped on the white rice that was included with my noodle dish which is also unusual. So, I tried rice noodles with beef, but rice noodles in this joint are not Singapore style (which I wanted), but instead were chow fun style whic is like american egg noodles basically. The english spoken by the front counter owner was not perfect and she also seemed in a rush to make that crazy 9:15 time a reality. Ok, so the noodles and the onions and scallions in the dish tasted like any other place, but the nasty, unedible and in some pieces uncooked (9:15?) pieces of beef really earned this place its one star. I order beef like once in three years in Chinese places knowing that every place usually sucks and this was no exception. The owner could have mentioned that i could have gotten all veggies, but she didn't when I questioned her and I didn't figure out on the long menu that i could have gotten the same dish for $7.95 with no disgusting beef on the American side of the menu instead of paying a buck more. There must be an asian TV show that starts at 9:30pm or something because I doubt you will ever see a 9:15pm closing time ever again. I think the show is called "food no Good"~~#~0
Go elsewhere.  Boy, I guess Leslie's saw us coming.  We are pool novices.  We recently bought a foreclosure house which had an existing swimming pool.  Within a week of moving in, I made the mistake of walking into a Leslie's.  $1000 later I had all of the stuff I supposedly needed for my swimming pool and an appointment for pool school to boot.  Fast forward 6 months. Week after week I go into these stores and have one problem after another.  My pool is never right.  It is never swimmable and they keep selling me more and more and more chemicals.  My pool is like a drug addict at this point needing a new fix every week to the tune of about $300 every time I walk into their store.  I finally decided for the money I was spending I could just hire someone.  Sure enough, for $140 the professional fixed everything and for $70 they include the chemicals and do the work.  All Leslie's wants to do is sell you stuff and they will sell you all kinds of extra stuff to keep you coming in.  I should have just hired someone to begin with but Leslie's kept telling me the next thing would be my magic fix.  There is nothing they have to sell there but heartache, and worse yet, they offer no guarantee on anything, they SAY in the big letters 14 day guarantee, but then the fine print excludes chemicals.  Yeah, that pool noodle really failed to perform, give me my 2.99 back.  And they act like they are doing you a favor at that.  These sharks have gotten their last dollar out of me.  They are not there to help you, they are there to line their pockets with you.  I guess if you need something and you know what you need and you can get in and out without buying anything extra they might be ok, but don't trust their advice.  I spent over 7 months with an unswimmable pool and have thrown several thousand dollars worth of chemicals into it, all from Leslie's.  I could have paid a service for a few years and my pool would have been perfect.  Live and learn and stay away from this place.~~#~0
I love TJ Maxx but after my wife stepped on a piece of glass and was bleeding through her sandal I was disappointed . There was glass all over the ground by the candles.  I understand accidents happen ok. But, we went in 2 weeks later and saw glass all over the floor AGAIN.  We did are shopping and we looked back before we left and it was still there just swept to the side.  WOW!~~#~0
I've had lunch here three times now.  The first couple times, I would have given it three stars, but the third time is definitely NOT a charm.  I'm giving it one star based on the completely inedible BBQ chicken and long wait.  This must be the leftover s*** chicken that no other restaurant wanted to purchase.   For a completely fattening, cholesterol laden meal, I would like to enjoy SOME level of flavor other than lard.  I calcuated the approximate number of calories (based on nutritional information from another fast food Hawaiiian restaurant with a nearly identicial menu) for a Chicken Katsu "plate lunch" to be a whopping 1,800 calories (1,200 for the chicken and 600 for two scoops of macaroni "salad" and one scoop of rice).  Gross.~~#~0
This place could have been amazing, I'll never know.My husband, who is vegetarian/vegan, and I, being Vietnamese, thought this would be a great place to try during our visit to PHX this past weekend. The trouble started when the owner, a white man, asked me why I didn't have a "vietnamese nose". I was taken aback, and did not know how to respond. I said, "what do you mean?" he replied, "you know, wider and flatter. You know, my wife is Chinese and raised in Vietnam." I was flabbergasted. I mean, I know he wasn't intending to be hurtful or borderline racist or whatnot, but it really bothered me that he felt he could say this to a complete stranger, let alone a patron in his restaurant, and that he felt justified simply because his wife is asian?? All I could muster up was "uhhh you'll find that people can look a variety of ways."  I don't know, even though he apologized, my husband and I were left with a very bad taste in our mouths and we ended up leaving before we could order. The owner was just weird, unprofessional, and inappropriate. It doesn't matter if the food is good, we weren't even able to get to that point.  It all turned out great though, because we ended up going to Green (see my review) that was close by, and it ended up being even better.~~#~0
If you like pizza with a TON of sugar in it, this is your place.  My husband and I found the pizza to be inedible.  When we complained, the woman behind the bar said that she's give us 10% off the next time we came in.  No thanks.  Worst pizza I've ever had.  If you really like pizza, try Oregano's, Grimaldi's or Pizzeria Bianco.~~#~0
Big let-down. The concept of the really cold beer is great, but it ends there. Service is horrible and it comes with horrible attitude. Food was okay. We got a really bad table with a glare from the sun and you couldn't see. Server said that she was really sorry she couldn't do anything about that. As I looked at the 4 - 5 empty tables around us we got up and left. It would have been so easy to offer us a new table and the bad one probably would have been fine in 20 minutes or less as the sun shifted. No food on the patio?  Really, in AZ?  And apparently it's serve yourself at the standing tables. The 7 somewhat attractive girls standing around couldn't be bothered to take an order. A restaurant like that shouldn't have any area other than the bar (where you have a bartender) that doesn't have service. Twin Peaks has it all wrong.  It needs to be about the customer and great service, not just the novelty of the views....~~#~0
Flat patties, tasteless, expensive. I will never eat here again.~~#~0
It's overrated sloppy and greasy.~~#~0
horrible old buns,.food cold first.mcdonalds that really messed up a simple burger###yeah fellow yelpers stay away from this one!~~#~0
Awful. Just awful. I could have dealt with the grainy queso fresco. I could have overlooked the undercooked corn tortillas. I was even partially amused by the eccentric (AKA somewhat rude) service. But when my girlfriend ordered the enchiladas with red sauce, it literally had NO TASTE. How is that even possible?  It just tasted like...well...red. My only working theory is that there are some five pound boxes of cayenne and paprika that have been sitting around on a shelf since 1973 and have completely evaporated any and all volatile flavor ingredients.And to top it all off, the chorizo and the picadillo tasted exactly like Taco Bell beef. BOTH of them.Never, never again.~~#~0
I stopped by the new Krispy Kreme at 7th & Roosevelt this past saturday and bought a coffee and a couple donuts, just to check it out.  We went to the science museum downtown, so we drove right by it twice.   It was pretty dead both times (1 & 4pm).   They didn't do much to change the interior sinec it was REV coffee, kept most of the TI's that were already in place.  Coffee was okay, not bad per se, but just typical convenience type coffee. It was very hot when served (too hot).   Compared it with the Dunkin Donuts decaf that we later got, DD was of course better.   Out of their 2 donuts, one was too "fried".  DD won on donuts too!~~#~0
I can't recommend this place.  While they have many lovely items, they have a "final sale" policy that they do not post or advertise.  Instead, they list it in very small type on their sales receipts.  Fortunately, I saw it before leaving the register today.  When I inquired, they verified that final sale meant that they don't accept returns or issue store credit.  I was surprised, given that it's a home design store, and customers can't exactly bring their houses shopping with them!  But a policy is a policy, so I simply asked them to cancel my sale right away.  I also suggested that they might want to post their final sale policy on the door or by the register so that they and their customers wouldn't waste their time, but they were pretty dismissive of the idea.  So please be advised that you absolutely can't buy anything that you aren't 100% certain looks great in your home!  The Great Indoors,  Holland Boone, Santa Fe Style, and Tlaquepaque are much more flexible and much better bets.  Oh, and also beware of Razmataz' as-is policy, and be sure to inspect everything very carefully.  We found a copper vase that was beautiful, but only on one side.  The other was scratched up pretty horribly.~~#~0
CLOSED forever...Too badA-Town is great to watch the games and have delicious food. The wings are big, juicy and grilled if you want, try the "hottest" sauce on the side. Great specials, happy hour and plenty of TVs. When the owner is there service is personal and friendly, never an empty mug! On Sundays they do Squares and raffle tickets for prizes. Last year they gave away a TV! Check them out~~#~0
OMG.  3 customers, 9 techs and still waiting over 1/2 an hour since my appt time.  All the "free" techs are doing each others nails.  Last time I come here.~~#~0
Horrible management. Lady cashier didn't give me my change . When I  asked about it she said she couldn't remember was her reply. I asked for a Manager. The rudest lady ever she said no way was i gonna get my change, until closing. Manager refused said it's store policy.  I waited for a hour until finally they counted the register found my extra change rudely gave me my change and gave no apology. Rudest people ever i will go to a bigger chain store next time.~~#~0
It is important to note that the one star rating has nothing to do with the food or atmosphere as we did not even get a chance to have dinner.  My one-star rating is personal and results from me and my family being super offended by the etiquette -- or lack thereof -- of this little gastroshop.  Nothing says, 'Children Not Welcome Here' like not providing a place for them to sit and have dinner.  No highchairs... really?First, I have heard SUPER great things about this great little hidden treasure.  I SO wanted the Tuck Shop to be my new fav.  My husband, child and are I are true foodies and as part of the Central/North Central community we truly love and support small, eclectic businesses that make up our cool little community.  When we pulled up to the Tuck Shop we were ready to become regulars!  So it was a huge disappointment when we got to our table and asked our server for a highchair for my daughter and his response was, 'We don't have highchairs.'  I was floored!  My husband and I spend a lot of time out and about and have never run into this situation.  After picking my jaw up off of the ground, I asked if children were not welcome at Tuck Shop.  Very flippantly, the server replied, 'No, we just don't have highchairs.'  Needless to say, I gathered my family and hit the road very offended and really not believing what just happened.  We have some pretty great places in our neighborhood... and they ALL accommodate children.  And for the record, I do not enjoy having dinner with screaming children.  I believe that if a child cannot behave properly in public, then they should not be in public.  This includes my child.  She has been carted to every restaurant in the Central/N. Central neighborhood so behaves better than some adults I have had the displeasure of dining with.  If she does happen to act her age in public, my husband or I quickly take her away so as not to disrupt the dining experience of others.  I realize not all parents follow our policy, but really Tuck Shop?  Seems like this 'No Children' policy was designed by a petulant and ill-mannered child.  Tuck Shop, me thinks you need a time-out.~~#~0
Wow. What a horrible experience. The only thing that saved me was my check in showing up on Facebook, and I had some friends text me they were there too, so between 4 of us, we split up, got in line for 4 trucks and ordered food for each other. The trucks need to organize and do this on their own in a parking lot on a regular basis. I know in downtown Phoenix they have their Food Truck Court Wednesdays which I've been to a few times but to have to pay for the privilege to eat at a food truck, and wait in line like this, not a good experience. I was hoping to spend some money, walk around and try different foods. Forget about it!! If it weren't for meeting up with friends, we would have eaten from just one truck and I would have to use the Yelp cliche line "Would give negative stars if I could"~~#~0
Not only was the food mediocre, but the staff was slow, unknowledgeable and incompetent (although very nice, so sorry about that guys). First of all, I have celiac or in lamens terms, I can't eat anything with gluten (wheat, oats, rye, barley) in it. So here I am at this kinda cute (kinda dumpy) diner with my boyfriend and I ask to see the allergen menu. So they come out with a packet with like 8 point font after a about a long wait, lovely. Then, our server takes about 15 minutes to ask us what we want...I ordered my meal, and substituded mashed potatoes for a side in order to keep gluten free. Just to be sure however, I asked our server if the potatoes are freshly made, she said YES. Well, I eat one bite of mashed potatoes and minutes later I am sick. So I went to the front to ask somebody, and three of the staff members sit there and argue about wether or not the potatoes are fresh and the kitchen is literally RIGHT BEHIND THEM! Hello, just turn around and ask! Finally, as I'm about to puke (sorry if that's TMI) one of them says "there's our manager go ask her." Uh, rude. So I do and she informs me that they are in fact not freshly made, they come in a package and probably do contain wheat contrary to the gluten free menu. So of course, my boyfriend and I pack up our food really quick, I tell her they basically just poisoned me and her response was to pay at the front. Awesome. Needless to say I will not be going back there ever again. What can I say that's positive about this place...(honeslty I'm not typically a negative person!) Well, they do look 50's, I'm sure it would be great place to take kids, and although I have a bad taste in my mouth about them not giving a crap that I just ate something I'm basically allergic to, they are friendly. So there, hope you enjoyed a small ray of sunlight in this negative review...~~#~0
Been here a couple times, never by choice. I can't really knock the service too badly as they don't seem any better or worse than any other chain on a busy night, but the food is just not very good. It's also pretty expensive for what you get. I always leave feeling like I would have been better off going somewhere else and either paying less for the same kind of food, or paying the same for way better food. I avoid this restaurant at all costs.~~#~0
Surprise!  It sucks here!We needed to get our nails done.  We came in and were seated in about five minutes.  They didn't start on us as soon as we were seated.Before coming in here my hands were lovely.  I don't have out of control cuticles or even the slightest trace of dry skin.  Yet, the girl made me bleed.  That's pretty much where I stop being nice.  No tip for blood.I can see the clear coat on top of the color.  It's like in globs and doesn't cover all of the nail.  You can't tell from a distance so it's all good.~~#~0
Where to start? Let's start by addressing the false advertising on their website.  After hearing a few people talk about how good the food is there , we wanted to give it a try.  We viewed their website and if you look under Entrees, you will see the meals are all priced at $10.18 per plate.  Good deal! We arrive at the place and our first impressions are, the place needs cleaning and a paint job.  Most anyone can look past how a place looks if the service is great and the food is really good.  Most dive places I've been to have both... so the decor isn't something I get hung up on. Service...  marginal at best.  Some guy... guessing the owner... arguing with the staff, singing... just doing whatever.  I guess this is acceptable since he owns/runs the place?  Not the best thing to do in front of customers. (again... it's a dive... not expecting 5 star services)Server---  stops my wife in front of the bathroom door to ask if she knows what she wants to order.  Maybe wait until we are all seated and ready to order?  Thought this was pretty strange! Now the food comes out.  Chicken wasn't horrible, wasn't great.  The canned mac-n-cheese... right up there with the best High School cafeteria mac-n-cheese.... not good!  Right from a box or can... no flavor... not homemade.   Very disappointing to say the least.  The greens... again... from a can... maybe some additional seasoning added... but.. odds are... if they were too lazy to make real mac-n-cheese... then they were too lazy to make real greens.  Gravy on the chicken... same sad story... from a box/can.... just not good or great. Dessert--- sweet potato pie   not bad... probably one of the better things ordered.  What was crazy... if you can imaging this... take a normal/decent size slice of pie... now cut that in half and this was the serving size we got.  All for $4.99 a slice. NUTS!  $10 for two slivers of pie. A joke! Remember I mentioned the FALSE ADVERTISING at the beginning of this review.  All meals $10.18.  NOT TRUE!  The site hasn't been updated in who knows how long? You sit down and the menu does not show the pricing... only mention of pricing is the Ox tales for $15.00.  So... you would assume from the website the meals are $10.18 each.  WRONG....  for  two meals, two very sad/small slices of pie.... $41.00 No breakdown of the pricing ... the owner/manager just punched up some numbers on the calculator and that was the bill. All in all... this place needs new management... some passion put back in to  the kitchen... and they need to update/clean the place.  Not to mention... in this day and age... no excuses to not having an updated website.... to properly reflect your business and pricing.  I have a feeling when Mrs White was running this place... it was awesome... not anymore. Bad experience.. not even close to being worth the money spent. Avoid this place...save your money....Will not be going back... will not recommend this place to anyone I know.~~#~0
Really like this place, honestly some of the best donuts I have ever had, but there's a reason I cannot give them more than one star and it is because of the way they operate the business. I have lost count now of how many times I show up 1, 2, 3 hours before closing and they are picked clean. That, in and of itself, I can forgive. But showing up and finding the chairs already up on the tables and the floors being cleaned more than an hour before closing? Talk about spitting in your customer's face. I used to ask myself, why even let people in the door if you're not interested in selling anything past noon-ish? Got my answer today. Showed up at 1:15pm, found the door locked, chairs up on the tables, signage turned off. Employee was cleaning the drive-thru intercom/display and another guy walked by the windows inside, so obviously the employees were there. I guess they figured they were low enough on donuts that they didn't want to work a full shift or something.I'm sorry but if I drive halfway across town thinking I for once have a chance to reach the store before it closes, and then over 45 minutes before closing, you lock the doors and give me the finger? Sorry, but there's no way you're getting anything but a 1-star review after that. You're only open until 2pm and you can't even make that work? Come on. Will I go back? Yeah, maybe if I'm in the neighborhood when they open, but apparently they don't stock enough product, don't stay open for the full published operating ours and don't even have the decency to at least sell drinks and their other merchandise until the actual closing time. Shame on you for locking your customers out almost an hour before closing because of your own inability to properly stock product and your desire to go home early for the day. What a bunch of lazy bums.~~#~0
Just walked in here all excited to get some Irish Nachos and we stood at the blank hostess desk for five minutes while a few waitresses walked around the restaurant, one hiding behind the bar who kept looking at us and not coming over. After a few more minutes and me literally doing some SOS arm-waving action, she came over to us.  By that point we were done, and she didn't seem to care at all. Didn't apologize. Just blank stare and moved on to the next person in line.  I'm all fine with bars with skimpy dressed chicks, but no burger or beer is worth that crappy of service.~~#~0
Looking for that sewing class to get your fingers moving changing a pattern and fabric into something you can wear?  Well don't choose their basic fundamental sewing class.  The class is more like supervised sewing for $100 bucks for 6 evenings of two women that don't teach only instruct when asked. The first class you also are required to buy a $15 patterns and a $36 book.  I was expecting some tricks of the trade.  Teachers that don't wait to asked questions.  How do I know what I'm doing is correct if there isn't even observation happening.  Don't waste your time or money!  You could get better instruction going on Youtube and watching videos when you run into a bump in your fabric.  The last kicker was I got sick and they told me to make up the class i needed to notify them 7 days in advance that I'd be out.  I was told its like buying a ticket to the theater and if I missed it I missed it.  But if I had tickets to the theater I could have made up the class because I'd be able to give them 7 days notice.  DON'T waste your time with their class!~~#~0
The family and I were at the Scottsdale Quarter a couple of weeks ago just walking around looking for a place to eat so we decided to try Grimaldi's. It was on. Sunday at around 2:00pm and it was not very crowded at all. Most of the patio tables were occupied, but inside was somewhat empty. When we walked up to the host/hostess stand we told them we wanted a table for four, two adults and two young children. We were immediately told that there would be a 30 minute wait because the pizza ovens were at capacity so they could not seat anymore tables. That was a first for me. Half the inside was empty, the patio was 95% occupied, not incredibly busy at all, but the ovens were at capacity??? I guess I had "Gullible Idiot" written across my forehead or something. It was obvious that they had other issues going on, either short of staff or something else, but at least tell the truth. A pizza restaurant half empty and the ovens are full... yeah fine, if you don't want our business that is fine. End result... I was so turned off by the treatment and attitude of the guy who handled us I just walked out. No way to treat a family at all. There are plenty of other places worthy of my money that appreciate my business. Hey Grimaldi's, get your act together if you are not planning in turning away more business in the future. I personally will not attempt a second time.~~#~0
Drinks are weak & from a mix, food is less then desirable & the waitress we got is so cranky that even my spanish speaking friends couldn't get her to crack a smile! skip this joint!~~#~0
I made a mistake, I made a mistake. I should be required to write this 100 times to remind myself how much I really don't like Pick Up Stix. I was desperate and hungry. I made a mistake.While the lunch special PRICE is good the food is not. The beef with broccoli should be called beef with broccoli and a cup of sugar. It's WAY too sweet. The fried rice is bland as was the egg roll. Hey, there was one good thing they had free refills on soda. WOO-HOO! If you're really, really hungry and there's nothing else open you'd be better off eating a piece of stale bread.~~#~0
I ate at Iruna I succumbed to severe stomach pains and ended up with diarrhea. This left me with a severe distaste for the restaurant and I don't think I could ever recommend such an experience to any of my friends or family. My dining experience at Iruna was on a weekday, Wednesday(7/21), around 8:00 PM. My girlfriend and I enjoy tapas on a frequent basis, and we previously went to Lola Tapas quite a bit before it recently closed down. We decided to try out Iruna, and we ate the gambas al ajillo, trout with salsa navarra, pil pil(halibut special), and filet mignon. Everything was good except the filet mignon, which was overcooked. The service was decent, and it was everything you'd expect from a Scottsdale restaurant.~~#~0
This place is the worst.I went around ten on Saturday night and it was packed.  It seems the place is intended to cater to rapey, Nickelback-loving, popped-collar misogynists and the women who love them.  There is no place to sit, no place to talk (because it is LOUD) and zero ambience.  To its credit, though, I was served quickly (because there were like 3000 bartenders) and it wasn't that expensive, but it would take much, much more than that for me to ever return to rape-central again.~~#~0
I only went here once.  I was going to wait a month or two and try it again before Yelping, but after reading all the reviews I had to speak up.Let me just get this out of the way...soft opening...blah blah blah...OK, now that we've moved past that.  The service is a complete disaster.  It was 20+ minutes, no joke, before we got water and ONE menu to share between the three of us.  After waiting that long for a menu we decided to play it "smart" and just order three appetizers and a beer.  My beer came 15 minutes later.  I ordered another one immediately, I never got the second beer.About 45 minutes after ordering the food came. We asked the girl that brought it what each item was, she said she had to go get our bill (to identify your own apps? really?) and disappeared.  She came back and said she couldn't find our bill and had to find our waitress (good luck!) to ID the apps. Really?The food did NOT make up for the service. Far from it.  The deep fried scallops sucked, could have reheated a box or pre-frozen scallops from the supermarket, thanks.  The rest of the food was uninteresting at best.We told two random girls we had somewhere we needed to be (I'm like 2 damn hours in at this point, the waitress never came to ID the food) and wanted our check.  They said "I can't find it, I have to find your waitress."  20 or so more minutes pass, still no check or waitress, we finally get loud so the waitress comes and asks what we need.  We say "Our check!"  Five minutes later she comes back and comps our meal.  I may not be able to give it a second chance, but other chefs have told me how awesome the head chef is supposed to be.  So I may go back and try the sushi, but it would have to be amazing.  Let me say something here, Otaku is a STRONG word.  I have a shirt that says Super Otaku I bought in Tokyo.  That word means "Nerd".  When applied to food especially, you are making a HUGE commitment.  That only made the experience that much worse.  They should change their name to whatever is Japanese for "Mildly Interested In."~~#~0
Food is tasty; however, food establishment REFUSED to honor purchased coupon from Living Social.  DO NOT spend your hard-earned money at India Palace.~~#~0
They tried to sell me an air filter, even though it was recently replaced. Came in with a coupon and they said it is not for the type of oil you need. Its crap like that that makes me think I am ready to find a new oil change place.~~#~0
Mulligans, I am disappointed in you.  This has previously been one of my favorite go to spots on the weekend, and I used to think of it as the perfect place to end the night.  However, it has gone downhill over the past few months, and after several horrible customer service experiences I do not think I will be frequenting this establishment again.  Let me be specific....If you mess with my money - and do so consistently and without apology...then I will not return, and I will be sure to tell as many people as I can, regardless of how "fun" your bar might be.A few months ago, I went to Mulligans, and when ordering my drink, I asked them to just leave a tab open and handed them my card.  I ended up ordering one more beer, and then closed my $9 tab at the end of the night.  The next day after checking my bank account, I was astonished to see a $50 hold on my account from Mulligans.  I immediately called them to inform them of the error, but was told, pretty rudely, that it was standard procedure for them to hold $50 for any opened tab, and that it would just "fall off" in a few days at my bank...nothing else they could do.   They did tell me that there was a small sign on the bar that mentioned this policy, and that I should have read it first (because that's apparently what people look for or notice when they go to the bar).  Furiously, I waited for 5 business days for the funds to become available again.A month or so later, I went in again.  Same situation, same low dollar bill, same $50 hold...although this time I just kicked myself for not remembering it the first time.  I did call the manager to ask if there was a way to avoid this other than paying cash (which I never carry), and was told that if I had closed my account after each drink rather than keep an open tab, I would just be charged for the actual dollar amount owed each time.  Good to know (although also a huge pain in the butt).Flash foward to last week.  I went to Mulligans again, this time for St. Patricks Day.  Based on my previous conversation with the manager, I was confident that if I just closed out my tab each time, I would be fine.  I ordered one beer (specialty for $3 dollars), and closed out.  Later that night I went back and ordered two more beers (total, $6) and closed out.  The next day, I checked my account.....and found that there were TWO holds on my account from Mulligans, for $25 each.I immediately called again and explained the situation.  The person on the phone immediately started in on their "policy" to hold funds when there is an open tab.   I told him that I had been aware of that , and that is why I closed out each time...So why I was being "held" $50 for a total of $9 was a mystery to me (and I was seriously regretting the tip at this point).  He stated "well,  the best I can tell you is to just wait for it to drop off, there's nothing we can do".  I told him that was not an acceptable solution to me, and he interrupted to say sarcastically "you really need to take this up with someone else...I'm just the barback".  So I asked him to take down my phone number and have the manager call me that night.  He took on an incredibly rude and sarcastic tone, and said (overenthusiastically)   "absolUTELY!!   I would LOVE to do that for you".  I ignored the tone and gave him my phone number anyway, and again requested that the manager call me that night.  He replied "ABSOLUTELY" again in his rediculous tone, and then hung up on me.  I never heard from the manager.This is incredibly poor customer service, a poor way to handle your customer's money, and a really EASY way to lose business.  By the way, it's 4 days later and the funds are still being held.  This is a recession people, I go places with cheap beer for a reason!  And I can guarantee you there are a million other places to go in Scottsdale that serve $3 beers and don't do it while stealing from your pocketbook (even if it IS supposedly temporary).  I suggest staying away from this place unless you like to have your money taken and you enjoy rudeness.~~#~0
American Junkie advertised no cover and open bar from 8pm-10pm for NYE. There was a small line when we arrived but it wasn't moving. The door man said they were only checking in bottle service customers and they will let the general public in at 11pm. We asked about their open bar promotion and they said if we want to get in we have to pay $60. We were very unhappy with their customer service and happily went somewhere else that charged a cover but treated their customers with respect. Firehouse and The Lodge are better options if you are looking for a casual bar in Old Town Scottsdale.~~#~0
Well, after my terrible experience with him screwing up the first 4 'microcavities', I didn't let him anywhere near the other 6 'microcavities' he claimed I had.  3 years later and still no 'full blown cavities' as this guy predicted.  He claimed that if I didn't let him put these phony 'micro-fillings' in my teeth, I would have full blown cavities in 6 months!~~#~0
The owner is very rude.~~#~0
Just came back from Sushi Ken. That would be our last time to go there. The service was horrible. I said again HORRIBLE. after they sat us down, We waited for 15 mins for water. When the food come, mine didn't come for a long time after they serve my friend's. Finally, the next table told the waitress they didn't order that dish. That was my dish. They took it to me. I wasn't very happy, but don't want to take it back. (who knows what they are going to do in the back) My friend was trying to stand up for me. He mentioned to the waitress we want a fresh dish. She said how FRESH you want. and look at us like we said something very ridiculous. Do yourself a favor, go somewhere else.~~#~0
Will never come back here.  They treat their animals terribly.  Went to their pumpkin patch and they had a petting area.  It was a really hot day and the water for the animals was filthy, covered in dirt and straw.Then, we took a wagon ride and it was a nightmare.  We stopped at the pumpkin patch for everyone to get a pumpkin.  As everyone was getting back on the wagon, one of the mules started freaking out and bucking.  The wagon was jerking all over the place.  I grabbed my daughter and got her off but, there were several people, many children, on the wagon and the driver never said anything about them getting off.So, we rush off to the side to get away from the horse and wagon and we realized that the horses legs were tangled in the equipment.  The driver just sat in his seat doing nothing but whipping and yanking on the reigns while this poor horse is struggling desperately to stand but keeps falling on his face.  I finally ask him if he realizes the horses legs are tangled and he finally decides it might be a good idea to get the people off the wagon.  But, even as the people are getting off, he's still whipping and yanking on the reigns of this poor horse who is struggling and panicking trying to stand up.   It was awful.  We ended up walking back and I did tell management but, 5 minutes later, this guy was heading out with another group, same horse and wagon.  I will never go back there again.~~#~0
They don't honor coupons from "Coupon Clipper" app.  They require the coupon to be printed. Not cool. I won't be back.~~#~0
This place makes me appreciate Jimmy Johns.  This place makes you feel like cattle being herded to the trough.  It's a Miracle they are still in business. You can get better sandwiches at Whole Foods or Jimmy Johns for a lower price!~~#~0
Most incompetent people and the service is horrible.   Biggest disappointment, Run and dont look back.~~#~0
Seriously...The food is AWFUL!!!!  Stay away!   Save your cash and get a McFishwich and some pink slime at Mickey D's (it's that bad).   Any self respecting foodie or experienced seafood patron will hurl.   Just because Pete's "looks authentic" don't get snookered.   The outdoor seating looks fun but the food will disappoint.   I should have known better than to try seafood in the desert.Let me discuss my pedigree for this assessment.   I'm from the east coast.  I grew up around a seafood restaurant eating Maine lobster, fresh scallops, fresh shrimp, fresh oysters, fresh claims...you get the picture.   The "fish" at Pete's is literally just a square patty of processed fish that is overly deep fried in a crunch batter.  They don't even make an attempt to use something resembling fresh fish.    The deep fried shrimp (again, overly fried and crunchy) looked like it had been pounded flat with a meat tenderizer and then subjected to a rolling pin before being dipped in oil.   Both the fish and shrimp were tasteless.   On an equally disappointing level, the french fries (usually a saving grace when the main course if bad) were equally terrible.   The fries were undercooked, limp, lacked flavor, and just didn't look appetizing.   Finally (and let me repeat...SAVE YOUR MONEY) we come to the "Pete's Special Sauce".   I can't believe they actually charge extra for this crap.   The sauce tastes like a cross between grocery store cocktail sauce and a hint of bad hot sauce.   It's watery, lacks any redeeming flavor profile, and bland.    If anything tasted OK it as the cole slaw that came on the "Messy Fish Sandwich".  The sandwich is really nothing to write about (same crappy square fish patty, same putrid special sauce, cole slaw, and an enriched white bun...blah).   At least the "Messy" had some flavor.To top it all off, the staff is emotionless and bordering on rude.   My order taker came across as if he were a struggling college student who felt the job at hand was beneath him.   The best (and I mean BEST) part of my experience was the water mister on the patio during a 100+ degree day.   At least they still can't mess up the refreshing feel of airborne H2O.AVOID, AVOID, AVOID!!!!!!~~#~0
Gave this place one more try after a bad burger .... never again spent my money elsewhere after a round of beer and dollar tacos...sorry rtos~~#~0
Disappointment! I have been a huge fan and loyal patron of Pei Wei since they came to the valley. We don't go as much as we used to, but a few weeks ago we ordered take-out. I asked if they would include both a mild and a hot sauce for the lettuce wraps and I customized a kids meal. When Dave brought our food home the first thing we noticed was 2 fortune cookies for three meals. Ok, maybe I shouldn't complain...but come on! Then the kids meal had barely any meat, another disappointment. First, I dove into the lettuce wraps, which they only provided one sauce - not the two they said they would provide. However; the worst part was my meal, I had the Mongolian beef...a dish I usually crave from them, but my meal was so salty I couldn't even eat it! It was absolutely horrible! Again, very little meat in the dish. Sorry, but I think you lost a customer over this meal!~~#~0
Terrible!! My wife dragged me here once again last month for her birthday and it was our last!! Here's how the nite went - sat down waited 15 minutes before we flagged down a busboy for chips and water. Chips came out hot and fresh with some tastey salsa! Thats when we should have left! We finish our chips and salsa - still no waitress, no menus and no waters!! And not just us mind you, the entire section!! Finally, a waitress gets to us and asks are you ready to order? Again, no water and no menus!! After another ten minutes makes her way back with water and menus and we order. Food comes out in five flat!! Precooked slop! Fish tacos stunk! No flavor - all fishy smell! Heres the kicker - shes drops a check on the table when we start eating and then gone again! She never comes back - no refills, no boxes for the kids meals, nothing! Again, this is the entire section!!! Well, I was going to skip out on the bill but, I paid and of course left her zero tip! NEVER, NEVER, NEVER, AGAIN!! My wife even apologized to me about going there - on her birthday no less!! AVOID! THIS PLACE SUCKS!!!~~#~0
Horrible, horrible service, all I can say.  I went there yesterday for the first time.  Some overly confident little guy with blond spikey hair was in charge of taking reservations.   He said it was an hour wait -or- we could go sit anywhere in the bar where it is first come first serve open seating.  So we go and sit at the bar, get menus, are about to order.  Then a table opens up in the bar room.  We leave our seats at the bar, go to the table, and some other people take or seats at the bar.  A few minutes later spikey haired little guy comes over and says why are you sitting here?  I was taken by surprise and said you told us it was open seating.  He cut me off, raised his voice, told me I was a liar, then asked if my friends and I Iike to eat at dirty tables (they had not yet been cleared).  I said of course not, tried to explain, and he left in a huff after making a scene.  We were planning at that point on finishing our drinks, leaving the table, then just waiting the hour for a table.  Then, a waitress comes over two minutes later, looks at us, and says loud and as rude as she could:  are you going to get up or what?  I have NEVER been treated so rudely ANYWHERE.  We just left.  Who cares about the food, the servers/ spikey haired hostess are rude, will never go again.~~#~0
Last night 11/9/10, 6 of us went to what used to be a top rated HappyHour here.  Let me tell you, cross it off your list! They've changed the appetizers, raised the prices and service was non existant now that theirbusiness has picked up!  We could not get waited on on the patio andactually went in twice to find our server, who announced she was really busy inside and didn't even attempt to apologize.  We ended up leavingafter over and hour and a half and went to another restaurant. Cross this place off your Happy Hour list-they no longer want our business!~~#~0
This place is no longer!!!!!!!  Hurray!!!! I knew they would'nt be around for long. The worst managed sportsbar ever. The new owners, and management have really turned this place around. The food is noticably better. The service is good now, and finally they have started to remodel, plus new LCD flat panel TV's. This place used to be Dutch John's back in the eighties, and had really never updated anything until now. It's now called the Tavern Grill. Check it out!~~#~0
Eh.  Only found one flavor that was ok.  It is a nice clean little place, but all in all, not much to look forward to.~~#~0
Apparently the new management didnt work out so well...... This place is out of business.~~#~0
This place just gave me the worst food poisoning I've ever had in my life!! The shrimp burrito did it to me, awful!! Nonstop vomiting, and stomach issues I will not mention for the past 2 days, and still not over it. It would be interesting to see what kind of health inspection report this place would get. Stay away, or you will be sorry.~~#~0
High priced DOG food. The boneless chicken wings were barely edible and made my stomach gargle for hours. This was the first time in a long time that I was actually concerned about getting violently ill. The bartender was terrible to say the least. Perhaps working New Years day was too much for her. Gallagher's is a sad establishment; with better management and improvements to food quality it could easily become better than Applebees. Management: Stop offering discount wings during happy hour, your staff gets rude to people who order them because they believe they aren't going to get a descent tip, your not helping yourself.~~#~0
All over $1. I went into Party City on Oct 20, 2011 and was looking for one particular item, I ran into a particularly common problem where a customer goes into a store and finds two identical products listed at two different prices. Went to check out, cash register shows the higher price. I noted to the cashier that there are two prices listed where I found this item (both the same item). Cashier spoke to the manager (whom was busy filling balloons) - manager said there was nothing that could be done. I cashed out at the higher price, walked to the manager and asked to come and look what I was talking about. Walked him to the back of the store, he showed me the high price - I showed him the low price, he agreed it was the same product and finally honored the lower price.I went back to the cash register was credited $1.00+tax back onto my card. If you're an employee of this Party City reading this review and you find yourself too busy to help the customer at a certain time, then believe the fact "the customer is always right".~~#~0
Imagine you have 3 boxes to choose from.  You open one, then decide whether to return it or keep it.  If you return the first and second, then you *have* to keep the third, regardless of whether or not it's better.  Well, going to Gyros Hut after Mai Island Grill feels like the 3rd box turned out to be a bag of baby poop.  I faithfully obeyed my adventurous nature by trying this newest Greek place around ASU, and it turned out to be the major disappointment of my week.  With hope in our hearts, the boyfriend and I ordered their Gyros and their Souvlaki.  Our hopes dashed with just one look at our Gyros meat.  Though Gyros Hut is generous with their meat portions... they needn't have been.  The Gyros meat reminded me of flavoured dry cardboard.  However... compared with my Souvlaki, I wished for that dry cardboard back.My favourite part of the meal: the onions and lettuce.  My question is:  What happened to Mai Island Grill???~~#~0
Everything here is mediocre.BlahThe food is blah, the menu is a snore, the restaurant ambience is dark and boringMediocre all the way.~~#~0
I would give Slices a 3 stars for their mediocre pizza however this place is dishonest. I ordered 2 cheese slices and a BBQ chicken slice and a gatorade and according to the prices on the menu, after taxes I should have only been charged between 11 and 12 dollars. However the guy told me $15. I did't realize he overcharged us until mid meal when I realized $17 dollars was way too much for what we got (wish I didn't leave a two dollar tip). Honestly, $17 dollars for 3 slices and a Gatorade? That's ridiculous, I can guarantee you I won't be going back there.~~#~0
My boss and I decided to stop in for lunch and give this place a try....I wish we kept on going down the road....we waiting about 5 minutes before we were finally seated. Our waiter was good at first, brought us hot, fresh bread that was pretty good but when he brought our appetizers of grilled mixed veggies, my boss practically choked on a staple! How the hell does a staple end up in an appetizer??? When we showed him, he argued with us that it wasn't a staple but part of the metal scrub brush his dishwasher uses....like that makes it better!! The little Italian lady at the front acted like she could care less, the waiter continued to argue with us on what the piece of metal REALLY was...I really think these people either have sh*t for brains or just don't care....either way, EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!~~#~0
Totally bummed that when I ordered TOFU and VEGGIES it came out cooked in chicken broth.  I'm sure it is my fault and I should have specified that I was a vegetarian but I thought that was implied from the conversation I had with the waitress and by the order.  I don't know any meat eaters (though I am SURE they exist) that order tofu & veggies when they go out to dinner.  I sent my food back and left.  :(~~#~0
I am just going to hit on the new "Mill Avenue's New Year's Eve" since most of the year, Mill Ave is exactly what you would expect so you should know if this is the kind of atmosphere you want to visit or not. Because the Fiesta Bowl didn't find hosting the NYE block party as profitable, Tempe was left to execute the event alone starting 12/31/12. Previously, Mill was barricaded off, you had to pay to enter, and the block party included a variety of stages and outdoor vendors you could visit while mulling around the crowds or visiting the Mill Ave shops/bars. At the north end of the party was a stage that generally included a well known music performance. Now that Tempe has taken over, the only significant difference between NYE and any other night on Mill is the crowded sidewalks. Now, while I have a hard time faulting a non-profit for backing away from a losing venture, in the case of the Fiesta Bowl, an organization that has proven to be a private circle jerk for Arizona's most-connected individuals, where their organization benefits heavily from public support well beyond their NP status, they seem to only find losing ventures as those which do not provide the most value to the Fiesta Bowl members personally. The city of Tempe's 2012/2013 event was enough to make sure I don't return next year. Honestly, I don't even give one star reviews but there is nothing to savor about the event as a whole. It's free and you get exactly what you pay for -- crowds of people crammed onto the sidewalks so pedestrians can't move and traffic can't make it through the crowds that saturate the crosswalks. There is no organization so each bar is doing it's own thing (except more crowded/expensive than usual), and all the while, the only "entertainment" is the same burnouts who always sit on Mill with their drum music trying to engage pedestrians for money.  But should you still decide to go next year -- because the city's PR department will tell us that they've made it better than ever -- don't say I didn't warn you.~~#~0
I wish I could give 0 stars! We discovered this place from restaurant.com. They had $25 gift certificates for $2.00!! Though that should have been the first warning sign, My Big Fat Greek Restaurant had the same deal going on and we all love it there.There were so many warning signs once we got there! I wish we had listened. The only thing good about this place was the company I was with.We came here on a Saturday night at 7:15pm. It's located in the outer perimeter of Westgate City Center next to My Big Fat Greek Restaurant and Camarones. It's very easy to miss. In fact, I drove by it twice. I should have kept going. You know when you're in a restaurant at Westgate on a Saturday and the restaurant is DEAD, there's probably a reason why.I honestly have nothing good to say about this place. NOTHING! Walking in, I quickly discovered it was probably about 85 degrees in the restaurant. Very uncomfortable if you ask me.Two of my friends ordered iced tea and quickly asked for another drink because the tea was gross.The salsa was Pace salsa.I like pace, I won't lie, but Pace doesn't fly at a Mexican(ish) restaurant. I can make them enough kick ass salsa to last all day in about 10-15 minutes flat.There was one other party there when we got there. It was my friends boss coincidentally. He went over and talked to them and they told him that the food sucked.We contemplated leaving right then and there but didn't unfortunately.I don't know why. Bad tea, Pace salsa, the ominous warning from the only other people in the restaurant...So we ordered, I got the La Torta con Al Pastor. The meat was well cooked but flavoreless. The bread was basically an oversized sesame bun.I only ate half. Not because I was full, but because I just didn't want anymore.My friend's chimichanga was completely unseasoned and my other friend made a couple comments about her salad not being any good.To meet the terms of our restaurant.com certificate, we all ordered dessert. One of my friends and I ordered cheesecake. Mine was still half frozen. The other couple shared a banana split (which was 5 scoops of vanilla ice cream, a banana, 3 cherries and a tiny bit of chocolate sauce)Now the review about the service. Never once have I been so irritated of being forced to pay a gratuity. There was only 4 of us and we were charged an 18% gratuity. The service was slow, the waitress was not the least bit friendly or personable. She wasn't even slightly pleasant.It took her 15min to bring the handwritten bill and once we got it I went up to the bar to pay it after waiting 10 min.Never coming back here. We actually were guessing how much longer they would stay open. My guess is they will be closed by end of the year.~~#~0
Beware! Much like the previous letter they refused to refund my money also stating their policy. I am now forced to go to small claims court to get my 1350.00 back. I had gone in because my sister had bought me services as a present. They high pressured me to buy I stated I could not because my scheduled was so busy. They stated they could do a Saturday morning appt but I would have to wait 2 months. Well I paid and waited for my appt, when it finally came I was told there was no doctor there on Saturdays when I asked for a refund I was told at first the doctor would have to okay it and after several calls that  I could not have a refund per their policy. They never performed any services which I paid for and now I will have to get my $ back via the small claims division! Take note they are also not members of the Better Business Bureau. Or I would have filed a complaint.~~#~0
This place needs to be shut down and remodeled from top to bottom. They should start with the GM, because it is obvious that no one in upper management cares about this place. Dirty and run down. A total joke. I would rather sleep in my car. Never again. Zero stars.~~#~0
Welcome to Scottsdale DD...So they've popped open a new store by Walmart, and I figured I'd give them a shot.  I can't tell you the last time I went to a DD... I've always been partial to KK.So I go driving up to the drivethrough, place is dead - dude's out sweeping the parking lot.  I pull up  to the drive through to bring in a dozen donuts to the crew here.  I say "I need tog et a dozen donuts"  seems simple, I'm not a quiet person, but she doesn't hear me.  I repeat the request and I am told to pull further forward toward the speaker (I'm looking right at the darned thing, but OK, I'll play).So I repeat and the repsonse is "1 dozen express doughnuts".    Nope, I want to pick 'em, I don't want 3 donuts I like - and 9 that everyone hates.  So I say, no I want to pick 12 donuts, and the response is again "1 dozen epress donuts".  I say NO I want to pick the doughnuts.  The repsonse is that"only epxress dozens are available at the drive through, to pick what you want you need to come inside.Are you really serious?  OK, even if that is the policy (which is a really dumb policy) customer service might say, "well, sir, this is our policy, but as we have no other customers within a 5 mile radius, we'll do it this time, but next time would you please come in?".  Nope, nada.So until KK returns (who I might point out screwed up their raspberry jelly donuts by swtiching the type of jelly - but that is for a different post), I guess I'll buy all of our donuts for sales meets and the like at Fry's or Safeway, or anywhere but DD.  DD;  What exactly are you thinking with this policy?~~#~0
Completely. Totally. Utterly - UN-impressed. I am not going to bother to nit-pick my lame experience through 5 'courses' (yes, 1 of them on a tiny spoon - maybe we took Thumbelina's table).  Salad: "OK"Steak: CHEWY (spat out several pieces - gross, i know)(with hash browns for DINNER?!?!)sourdough bread served with olive Oil (!?!) combined taste = acidicsmurf blue cotton candy  (WTH?!?!)1 star for a yummy dessert - but by then i was pissed off, so it only counts to actually write and insert this reveiw!ended up a pissy nite with us blaming each other who's stupid idea it was to choice to waste our nite (and MOOLA !!) here.~~#~0
Had heard nothing except rave reviews on this place, so decided to check it out.  BIG MISTAKE!  Over priced for the quality.  Mixed "Vegtables" on menu... not vegtables.  Was a veggie.  And if you have a coal burning oven, why would I get some nasty snap peas!  Grilled peppers, squash, eggplant seems to be a much better idea.  I went in the next day to complain and was spoken to by a bartender who spoke extremely dissrepectful to me and never offered to even get a manager.  This place won't last with a $6 burger at Flemmings that KILLS the quality and experience!  Too bad!~~#~0
Not cool!  Just received a bill in the mail for this allergist.  They apparently think I owe them $200 for uncollected payments over the last 2 YEARS.  Its literally a bill that is 10 pages long with small charges from the last 15 months.  I went there for over 2 years and these payments were never once mentioned to me.  Not very happy about this at all.~~#~0
If I could travel back in time 30 minutes, I would just so I could punch myself in the face for opting to try this place.For starters, this is NOT a coffee shop.  While they are trying to angel themselves as such, they fail in that attempt.  Their failure really isn't any surprise, as the coffee menu was very limited and the girl behind the counter clearly wasn't a barista.  I ordered a latte, for lack of my normal (seemingly generic) mocha being on the menu.  After 10 minutes, I finally got it only to have it taste like what I assume old engine oil tastes like.They also fail at being a bakery.  I don't want to be too harsh, but if I wanted a Fry's croissant, I'd go to Fry's.  They have a very limited bakery selection with their display having little more than a few cookies.I will give them credit that their prices are cheap.  I also give the girl behind the counter credit.  She was having to wear 4 hats at once.  She worked hard and was very nice.  And they do have a lot of space.  But I really can't see myself going back, which is sad because there aren't a lot of independent coffee shops in this part of Chandler.~~#~0
My best friend was in town and wanted to check this store out.  She found it on Yelp and being a plus-sized women, she loves to check out new places that offer clothing for 'real' women.  What a waste of time!  We made the drive to North Scottsdale and the place had styles for my grandmother.  Nothing was young and hip in the store and everything looked like a moo-moo.  I'd recommend going there if you were 60 and above.We were in the store for 10 minutes and none of the snobby sales people behind the counter even bothered to come say hello or ask us if we needed help. Just because we don't look like richies doesn't mean you can't acknowledge us.~~#~0
This place is terrible, I have been here twice and I do not plan to come here ever again. The valet crap is a joke, everyone wants to flaunt their "so called" money and cars pffff! The guys at this place are douche bags, I think women have more luck meeting a "real guy" at a gay bar. lolThe bartenders are overbearing and slutty, the 2 times that I have been here, I have seen numerous bartenders slip phone numbers to married men right underneath their wife's noses! I mean come on!I have to say this place really sucks, tons of fake, fake, fake people. This place is nothing but a competition to the most elite, superficial,  people of the world  The ultimate epitome bar of Scottsdale hands down.I give it 2 thumbs down~~#~0
I recently spent 8 hours a day for an entire week in this hotel's conference rooms, for work. My colleagues at this event were all from various states, ranging from California to Connecticut to Texas. I was actually the only local yokel. So, in addition to getting a feel for the place during the day, I also collected a number of opinions from people who spent each night at this hotel.Why?Why would anyone stay here? The rate one of my colleagues paid was $275 per night. For just a bit more you can stay in one of our fine resorts. The rooms are adequate. The gym was reported to me as being pretty crappy. The only plausible reason for paying that amount is its proximity to Sky Harbor Airport. Personally, if I'm paying $275 (plus tax) a night, I'd probably be willing to shell out an additional $50 for the round-trip cab ride to stay at the Biltmore or something along those lines. One California lawyer I spoke to did exactly that. But to each their own. When I discussed this with a local friend, he was also baffled. Apparently the University of Arizona basketball team stays here too, when they come up to play ASU. This, however, I understand. Would you want your 21-year old superathletes to roam around freely on Mill Avenue or in Old Town Scottsdale the night before a big game?In sum: Location = crap.Price = crap.Rooms = whatever.One star.~~#~0
Just plain unprofessional!~~#~0
Awful ... This was a terrible experience. The meat was old looking - slimy and grey and the broth or whatever they call it that we were supposed to cook the meat in looked like dirty sea foam and tasted worse. Not to mention the fact that we were left to sit in front of this boiling pot of yuck for more than 20 minutes before I finally went to find our waitress to ask where our food was.... Anyway maybe they were having an off night but both my daughter and I were beyond disappointed. I will never go back.~~#~0

Went here Saturday after a long absence and was reminded why there has been such a long absence.  The food was mediocre and the facility is pretty run down. I had the BBQ Pork, coleslaw and peach cobbler while my wife had the BBQ Pork and potato salad. We both thought the BBQ pork was a 3 or 4 on a scale of 1 to 10 and the coleslaw and potato salad were no better.  I was so looking forward to the peach cobbler but even it wasn't very good.   If you're in the area and want good BBQ go two minutes away to Hap's BBQ on Washington and 48th.  Of course Joe's BBQ in Gilbert is great too and even Famous Dave's kicks this place.~~#~0
I have been to this establishment twice now on a Friday. Let me start by saying that if you are at all in any way shape or form prejudice or racist this is not the establishment for you!!! It is an extremely diverse crowd. So if you are close minded and ignorant go somewhere else. Secondly, the first time my boyfriend and I went we had a good time, but after last night I don't know if I'll be going back. I had a tab at the karaoke bar and I was extremely disappointed in the bar tenders service. He was rude, disrespectful and unaccommodating. The rotation for the karaoke was awful! I waited for quite some time before I was called the first time, and I saw others go multiple times before I was called again. I understand that it's a neighborhood bar and you can't hold it to the standards of a Scottsdale bar, but those types of places should be even more concerned with customer service and satisfaction, because they want to keep repeat customers, and then on top of that they charge a cover! I should have listened to my sister and friends and went to Hurricane Bay. No cover for ladies, & 50 cent drinks! Actually, I am kind of embarrassed I even brought my friends to this place :(~~#~0
didn't like~~#~0
I have visited this place a couple of times to pre-game for a D-backs or Suns game.  I now spend my money at Rose and Crown which I think has way better food and drink options. Meal:  I usually would go with a burger or the nachos.  The beer selection is decent.Taste:  The food is incredibly bland and I have serious doubts that they actually cook anything.  I think everything they get is pre-packaged and they just warm it up.  The beer is also not very good.  They have a good selection but I don't think they clean their tap lines out very often.  Every time I have drank a draft beer from there, the beer smells a little musty and tastes like mildew.  6 out of 10.Value: Portions are decent, the food should taste way better for what you are paying for, and the beer prices are crazy high.  Its not bad if you hit happy hour or some other special, but frankly, there is no real value at Cooperstown. 2 out of 5.Service/Cleanliness:  Ehhhhh . . . that is the only way I can describe it.  The level effort put forth by the servers is the bare minimum.  6 out of 10.Atmosphere:  It seems like the managers/owners are trying to0 hard.  The servers are all gothed out and it comes off as hokey.  The sports and music stuff on the walls is pretty cool and the outdoor patio is awesome.  3 out of 5.Overall:  Forget Cooperstown.  Do yourself a favor and go to Rose and Crown down the street instead.  17 out of 30 points, 1 out of 5 stars.~~#~0
The only thing that is ok here is the bulgogi.  I'm half-Korean and nothing here impressed me.  The sushi is not good at all.  The rice is gummy and the fish has no real flavor.  I heard so many people from Luke AFB saying this place was awesome, but I wouldn't try it again.~~#~0
This place is crappy. What's stupid is I can go back to this place and my husband can't. He is not allowed back because of his fathers screw up. He has never been apart of his dad's life and never shared a room at this hell hole.We didn't know he would be our neighbor when we stayed there.  This affected us if we ever wanted to move there in the future and thank goodness we don't. Check out Legacey Suites at 83rd ave and mcdowell. They are much better and cleaner,~~#~0
No windows, so it's kind of dreary inside. Fancy lighting on the walls that changes color. I had a breakfast skillet that was mostly potatoes, the sausage was cheap skinny link sausage that had been sliced into discs, and flavor was lacking somewhere. I needed to add salt and ketchup, and I don't even like ketchup on my breakfast foods. Too many potatoes. And the price for a dish was about a dollar or two more than it should be.~~#~0
EEEEEEWWW!  Total disappointment! I can't believe this place has any good reviews... what are people thinking?  I guess I'm spoiled with super delicious Thai food in San Diego. hmmm.... I am in town and found this place on google.  I ordered Yellow Curry (because of the positive reviews) and a small cup of Tom Yum soup.....$17 + change total.  Not only was I totally ripped off, my curry was extremely watered down. There was a crap ton of Tofu (which was the one good thing) and only a few pieces of potatoes and carrots.  The soup was watered down as well and prepared completely different then what I am used to.  This place sucks and I will never go back.  Epic FAIL!~~#~0
Booked with my smart phone and payed in advance. The mobile website gave me the option to book different rooms according to room occupancy. I chose the room that would fit my family of four. It gave no option to change from the default 1 adult 0 children. I clicked on book room and payed. upon arrival at inn clerk asked me how many children were with me I told her 3 but my oldest would be staying at my fathers house. She said I only booked for one adult. Then she said it would be $18 more per night. She then asked me how many adults would be staying . I told her just me and my wife. She said that it would be now be $28 more per night. I said "come on give me a break here!" A man then joined into the conversation that worked there. At this point my wife and 3 kids walked in the lobby. She then began to yell at me saying that you told there were only 2 children and now my rate is now $48 more per night. My father then walked into the lobby as he was meeting us there to pick up my oldest.  She continued to berate me in front of my family calling me a liar. My father asked them why are yelling at my son? He then took the 5 and 6 yr old kids outside so they didn't have to listen to the "discussion". I called the 1800 number to change my reservation. The customer service rep told me that the system wouldn't allow it but that it should not matter as the rate would be the same for 1 or 4 people anyways. I told them this and they said that they didn't care and if I wanted to stay there it would be $48 more per night and they didn't want me to stay there anyways. I told them that I would find lodging elsewhere. They refused to return my money. All this aside... The hotel was in a very sketchy neighborhood with trailer parks within view of the inn. The facilities were a bit rundown from the outside.~~#~0
YuckSorry but I was really disappointed in this place.  I am not a huge fast-food fan anyway but I do think there are places that offer counter-type service with quality ingredients that are decent and worth while especially when price and speed are a consideration.  This was not one of them. Why you say? Well:*The place was not kept clean.  Tables were not bussed as often as they should be, the salsa bar was picked at and not kept up.*The food is really bland and obviously thrown together.  *One person in our party had a breakfast burrito, there were shells in the eggs, come on....no excuse fast-food or not.  *I agree with one of the other reviewers that when a vegetarian and a place has a "veggie" burrito, they need to make it veggie or don't offer it as such.  Sure, most people who frequent these types of places are likely not looking for the veggie options BUT don't say you have one when you really don't.~~#~0
I have been there twice- 2 times too many. I had acrylic nails put on and they looked hideous. Prices are decent for a reason. The people were friendly, but the actual service was horrible. The nails were crooked and I had to go home and fix them myself. I actually thought to myself how stupid can these people be--- it's your job. Either way.. don't go there.~~#~0
Just got back from eating "dinner" there. Or should I say trying to eat it. In a nutshell, you couldn't drag me screaming back into that place. And if you could, nobody would hear me because the music is so loud it's almost impossible to talk to somebody in your booth. I'm sure the waitress didn't hear a word I was saying either. The food took forever to make it to our table and two of three dishes were just plain awful. No flavor, bland, in some weird sauce, and no spices whatsoever. Nice. The other dish was a meat dish, but it was some kind of mystery meat that was so tough I thought I might ask to take it home for our dog, but I didn't want to do him a disservice, so I passed on that one. Nice. Our waitress disappeared and when I asked a group of staff if somebody could please bring our bill, they gave me that "look". You know the one. Yes, that one. Really nice. I agree with everybody that gave this place a one or two star review. That's one or two stars too many. And next time you get food poisoning anywhere, please call the Maricopa County Board of Health and report it. They are required to send somebody out there to investigate these things and they will. Also, a report will be made about a Food Born Illness (FBI) and you can view all this stuff on the web for future trips to any restaurant.~~#~0
Gone to hell in a waste basket. Slam are up coffee is 2 bucks2 slams and 2 coffees over $19~~#~0
Where do I start.  The burgers - All  were over cooked.The fries - they were soggy.  We told the waitress that they weren't edible and sent them back.  She brought out a new order and they were just as bad as the first.Warm Jumbo Bacon Salad - It's listed under Starter on the menu and that's how we ordered it.  It came out after all the burgers and fries.  The bacon on the salad wasn't cooked.  It wasn't edible.Chocolate Bread Pudding -  It was cold in the center.We thought they had a great concept for a restaurant and we love burgers, so we were excited to eat there.  We will never go back.~~#~0
We've Always had a fair experience at this place over the last few years. Great beer, average food that gets the job done on a fun night out. The customer service has been going downhill recently. I'm sad to say that our recent visit to STBCo will be our last due to HORRIBLE customer service displayed by our server AND the on-shift manager. The manager was arrogant, aggressive, and completely disrespectful. With leadership like that, customers are subject to poor a experience. The beer is great and thankfully I can still enjoy STB brews across the street at Coach & Willie's. A+ for beer....by they Fail on customer service.~~#~0
Located at end cap of strip mall. Reef? One very badly executed wall mural. Food was poor, though my wife liked the chicken wings & sweet potato fries. Kind of like a rec room in a prison, with same clientele. Large screen televisions and very loud hip hop music. Needs demolition rather than a makeover. Almost any choice for a sports bar is better. Waitress told us she had worked there 13 years and that there were new owners who had added "reef" to the name, Apparently for no known reason. A  depressing "dive" w/o redeeming virtues. Even with coupon promotions, this place has little to recommend it. 2 thumbs down.~~#~0
Had a horrible experience last night. They had a Halloween costume party on one side  and Bollywood night on the other. The security seeing we were desi's asked us to go to the other side. Will never return.~~#~0
Staff were completely uninterested. Bread was kinda soggy (on the outside) like it was close to something steaming, and one of the cucumbers were moldy/rotten. Won't be going back. EVER.~~#~0
Oh, have I tried so hard to like Barrio Queen, more than once, with the same poor outcome...I went here for my birthday, and I'll try to keep it shorter than my 3 hour wait, even though I was told it would only be a 30 minute wait, an hour at the longest, and people were sat before me that had arrived after me. But they apologized...finally....and did make it up to my party and myself and thankfully the food was good. However, they made an impression and it was bad, but I tried to overlook their obvious lack of service, gave them the benefit of the doubt, good food will always win me over.So, I considered this experience a fluke (very nice of me...) and I decided to go again on a slow Tuesday and give them a new chance. I ordered a margarita with no salt, what did I get? Salt...and mind you, we were at a booth next to the bar, and our server was the bartender and it was slow. I proceeded to order items, which I had ordered before, that were actually good the first time. Imagine my surprise, when the food I received looked like someone had just thrown random items on the plate with guacamole that was already turning brown as compared to when it came neatly presented to me and looking so tasty and fresh the first time. I inquired: had plating changed? Was there a problem with their avocados, produce, etc? The server said no, I pointed to the obviously wilted and browning ingredients- I was getting frustrated. I continued through the remaining sloppy dishes, while the manager decided to sit at the booth next to us and chitchat apparently with some business buddies. Who's commentary of every girl that walked by was extremely distasteful instead of keeping an eye on the kitchen and watching quality control. I was not asked for a second drink until the meal was finished, our water was never refreshed even though our glasses went empty halfway during the meal, and obviously not asked how our meal was/went. I tried, I really did...but lack of customer service and inconsistent food quality will have me avoiding this place even if I was starving and desperate.~~#~0
Well, isn't this awkward? Long story short. At least I'll try. I paid $100 (that's a 10% discount) for office visits and was regularly provided with free sample prescriptions as I was in between insurance. Nice Dr. Fry. I always paid right after the visit as I set up a next appointment. One time I went to pay and the receptionist nodded, winked and "shooed" me away as if to say "don't worry about paying today." I left. I wasn't chased and tackled to the ground for not paying. A complimentary visit. Nice Dr. Fry. Six months later I receive a bill. From a collection department. Mean Dr. Fry. I called Dr. Fry's billing office. Not helpful. At all. I was forced to pay the collections company and yet another bronze star to my credit. Mean Dr. Fry. Good bye Dr. Fry. Oh. Yea, and now I have insurance! :)~~#~0
Q: How do they serve you a diameter-of-your-fist sized roll for $4?A: Old fish.~~#~0
I just want to preface this by saying I LOVE to go out to eat.  And I am not picky and NOT hard to please.  But last night's dinner was one of the top 3 worst dinning experiences of my life.I don't think the night could of possibly gone worse.  We walked in and were completely ignored.  Servers acted like we were in the way (there was no where to go - didnt they just remodel?  Couldnt they fix that?). And the restaurant was practically empty.  Finally someone came up to us and asked to help us.  I told them we had a reservation and they started to walk us to a table.  The aisle is only one person wide and he walked us to a table full of people.  He said "oops, that was wrong, I guess we are going over there..." so we all had to turn around and shimmy down the aisle to the OTHER side of the restaurant.  We were sat in a booth for a few moments when we were approached by an employee who told us we couldnt sit there and the person who sat us "was just a busser."  Um, WTF?  So we are moved to a 1/2 booth/table.  Finally sat, a server immediately approaches us and asked if we would like something to drink or an appetizer.  Um, just sat down, super annoyed, can i get a minute to recover please?  And this server then proceeded to suck my will to live the rest of the night.  More on that later, though.It is ridiculously dark in the restaurant.  Like, cannot see jack dark.  And the pillows in the booths kind of gross me out...like sleeping in a stranger's bed with dirty sheets.  And bottom line, the food isnt good enough to put up with price and the hassle of valet parking.  My mother in laws steak was well done when she ordered it medium.  My "stuffed" pork chop didnt appear to have anything in it.  But again, it was so dark I could of been eating a bear for all I know.Back to the server.  She would take our order, not write it down and come back FIVE MINUTES LATER and double check with us what we ordered.  And her guess was wrong!  She did it with the drink order AND the food order.  So I guess it makes sense the steak was incorrectly cooked...End of drinner, we just want to get the hell out...server takes the bill and credit card, brings it back with no receipt to sign.  And of course never comes back.  We had to hunt someone down and he brought us back the recipt to sign.  Sigh.At the very end of the night, we then get stuck waiting in a line for the valet.  Some lady butted in front at the line.  Unfortunately for her, she got the brunt of my frustrations.  Poor gal was probably just as scarred by her shitty dinning experience.~~#~0
0 Stars if I couldThe new owner & management is not customer focused.  We walked in last Saturday at 9:00 am and there was not one customer in there.  We inquired about getting two pedicures, the owner/manager told us they couldn't help us because we didn't have an appointment.  They were expecting their first appointment at 10:00 am.Needless to say we walked out and will not be returning.~~#~0
DON'T EAT HERE ! This place was so dark! I couldn't read the menu! I asked both the waiter and the manager if we could turn up the lights and they just said no. They brought me a flashlight to read the menu!  Stupid and just plain silliness. The guy and his girlfriend had to get out their phones to read the menu.  We walked out.**NOTICE** the trending details for this place has gone down dramatically over the past 4 months.  What does that say!!  Service sucks.** NOTICE** One of the reviews mentions that there was a COCKROACH just not once but TWICE in someone's salad. Health department needs to come out to this place.~~#~0
This place is extremely inefficient and will try to rip you off if you do not have a general familiarity with postal/UPS/FedEx rates.The previous reviewer said that the longest line in this place is 3 people, however that's the equivalent to 10 at a post office. GPP takes what you want to mail and puts the return address info, as well as the person's info where it is going, into their computer--for each package or envelope one mails. It is an extreme waste of time. I've still yet to get a good answer as to why they need to input all that info into their computer.Also, their rates are extremely higher than the Post Office or even card stores that do mailings. They sell flat rate boxes for approximately $2 more than it costs to ship in elsewhere. I recently sent a package out to NY for $8 and when I went in this week to send the same item in the same envelope to LA I was quoted $6 higher. Once again, I was not given a respectable answer why.I went to a Mesa card store and it was once again $8.I asked if the postal rates went up from last week to this week  and the clueless woman behind the counter (who had just told a customer before me that rates were going up again in May) said "I don't know."How you can work in a postal facility and have no idea what basic packages cost to send to certain areas of the country blows my mind.I even asked if the scale was calibrated properly and I was told it was, but I once mailed something there where the price ended in .02?Nothing in mailing ends in .02 and that should have been a red flag to the employee, but clearly it wasn't. The Better Business Bureau should check this place out. The only good thing about this place is that you could park in front of the door because hardly anyone goes in there. I found out the hard way why. Oh, they also do FedEx, however they cannot print out pre-paid labels if you walk in with an authorization number and you'll be sent elsewhere. Extremely inefficient, poor communication skills and crooked in the way it does business. I tried to give it zero stars and the Yelp system wouldn't let me. One is too generous.~~#~0
I have no clue what people are talking about. I hated this place, I mean its sad for the owners.. but that aside, this place was fucking gross. Everything tasted like nasty bean water, apparently only chain smokers ate here who burnt off their taste buds. My friend raved about this place. So I came here 2 times the first time I threw it out after about 3 bites. My friend begged me to give it a second chanceI didsame thingIm sorry but I seriously question the freshness of these ingredients. and it was overpricedP.S.Sorry owners..no offense~~#~0
This goes for all PB's not just this particular location.  Shame on you! I used to love this place and it was #1.  I loved you 10x more than Wildflower.  Guess what? Wildflower surpassed you in quality now.  You are trying to save money and thought we wouldn't notice you are giving us less and charging us more and complicated the salad menu.  But not only are you saving money by giving us less... the product itself just isn't the same.  After years of going there, I have no intention to go back.  It just isn't good anymore and I don't like being tricked.  In these times, you're getting more for your money at restaurants.  Why is Paradise Bakery doing the opposite?~~#~0
I should have listened to the reviewer from 11/1/2010 but I figured it must be ran differently a year later, NOPE. They gave me an estimate for close to $364. I got a second opinion thankfully and I was really only looking at $188. I will not be returning because they wanted to charge me for unnecessary repairs.~~#~0
The performance was mediocre,We had a tough time obtaining water.The food was overpriced compared to what it was.The quality I got wasn't worth the price.~~#~0
Our family decided to give Cibola Vista another chance in August 2012 after a horrible experience the first time we visited there in 2010.Our first mistake was in thinking that maybe things had changed over the two years since our last visit... they changed alright! We thought that it could not get worse;We also wrongly thought that getting the very best high end penthouse suite would help sweeten the experience... WRONG!!! The room was a disaster, dirty, smelly, no WI-fi, some kind of biological or other fluid all over the TV remote, with only half of the light bulbs working, urine still sitting in the toilet, air-conditioner only cooled the room to 85 degrees after 6 hours. The  towels and linens were dingy and smelly. The washer and dryer was completely inoperable, and the sudden gushing stream of water from the rooftop AC condenser unit into our bathtub at 11:30pm did not bother us, as the "adults" partying in the unit below us and wandering around the resort in a drunken stupor were louder than the flood in our unit.  When we called the front desk to complain we were politely told that they were sorry and would have someone look into it...  5 days later still partying loudly! The incessant barking dogs left locked into units barked all night and day did not seem so bad after the copious amounts of vomit  still left in the elevator at  11:30 am one morning from the partying the night before. People just leave their trash sitting in the hallways hoping someone will take it to the dumpsters for them. The BBQ grills are not  cleaned frequently, as there was left over fish of some kind all over both of the ones by our unit three days in a row. There were no recirculation pumps for the hot water system so it took forever for the water to get hot in the mornings. and our whole unit was absolutely infested with crickets! Live crickets were in the toilets, sinks, showers, bed, hallways within the unit, and DON"T open the lower cabinets if you don't like bugs! We had to sweep up dead bugs every morning before starting our day. The pool while looking inviting, was disappointingly warm, with the skimmers not appear to be working, lots of unrecognizable floating debris, and green slime around where the water level in the pool was. But even that was comforting compared to the boisterous behavior of the unsupervised, unruly, drunken fools in the pool, it was not even safe enough to let my 5 year old daughter  into the pool. The teenage inexperienced "lifeguards" that were supposed to be on duty were so busy hiding from the situation behind the slide that they could not have helped anyone anyway.If you are looking for a dirty, trashy, nasty place to party like a Porkey's style college dorm, then this is your place!If you are looking for a family vacation in a reasonably clean and quiet location look elsewhere, as Cibola Vista is a dump, with management, maintenance, facility, and customer service issues! Very dis-pleased that this is how my time-share money is managed!We will never return to this facility.~~#~0
Mediocre food at best and overpriced.~~#~0
Good beer.. That's about it!  Had wings for an appetizer... Pretty good.. But too tangy for my liking and not spicy enough even when ordered HOT.  I had chef salad.. Who can't make a decent chef salad? Blue cheese dressing wasn't the best by any means. The chicken strips and fries were actually pretty good!  They were out of the beef wellington... So my boyfriend ordered the filet... What a joke! Sauce was horrible and the steak didn't have a great flavor!Service was horrible.. One girl took our drink order and another one took our food order who was brand new and didn't have a clue.. And another girl checked in a couple of times who seemed to have been training the other girl...the bartender dropped our food and replenished our drinks..R u confused yet? Because that was exactly how our experience was..Should have went to chili's!~~#~0
Between 2005 and 2010 I've been in C4 several times....for breakfast, coffee, happy hours and dinner parties!  But I moved to CA in 2010 and when I decided to take a large party of friends there for a dinner last week I was completely shocked to find that the servers were so young and inexperienced that they had no idea about the wine list, their attention to our party was sub-par and as I looked around at other tables, they were experiencing the same thing.  I would have moved my entire party to another location but it would have been too much work at that point and time of the night.Finally I had to go to the bar and beg our server to give us better service.  I had people in from out of town and they were starting to ask why I had selected this venue, as it was anything but "high-end" and fabulous!Just a couple hot tips.....put a bartendar in place so that the servers don't have to make their own drinks.  Train the staff on the wine list and about wine in gerenal.  If there are two people out for the night and the staff is not sufficient, owners/management must step up.....a weekend night is not the time to let service go.I hate to say this, but C4 won't be on my list for dinner again.  I may grab a coffee there if I'm in the area because that can't be screwed up and the folks behind the coffee bar know what they are doing.C'mon guys.....you used to be soooo great!!!~~#~0
In 2007, my BFF & I finally pulled into our beloved Tempe after driving for 16hrs from what felt like the other side of the world. We were exhausted, emotionally and physically taxed, and ravenous. Didn't want to go through a drive-thru. Like hell either one of us was cooking. So we hopped out for Panda Express takeaway.I ate & went to bed. Got up a couple of hours later to fasten my head to the porcelain god for the entire rest of the night. I rang in my first sunrise back in AZ for 2007 purging my "meal" from the night previous through vomitous fanfare. I can't even go near one of these poor excuses for Chinese food now. Haven't touched it since. Did I gross you out? Don't blame me. Blame Panda.~~#~0
we have been to multiple thai restaurants in the SE Valley and this restaurant was by far the worst thai food we have eaten around here!! Service was alright but food quality was sub par... not returning~~#~0
This is by far the worst Burger King that I've ever been to. It took them about 3 minutes to help me at the drive thru, I had to repeat my order multiple times because they kept getting it wrong, and to top it off, THEY GAVE ME MILK THAT EXPIRED 2 WEEKS AGO!!~~#~0
Ok so we get here 20 min before closing time and I know it must suck for someone to come right before you close but those business hours are there for a reason. To provide a service the entire time of your posted hours... with that being said this place didn't have everything available to us while here and than when I asked for something on the posted menu at the drive through they tell me it is no longer being served at this location. Needless to say that made me upset but when we asked for the potstickers they said they were out for the night. An item that takes less time to make than the time we spent at the window waiting for them to provide us with our food. Whatever happened to pleasing the customer? It is poorly ran and managed and someone was eating while in the middle of taking my order. I will not be coming here again and telling my friends to avoid this restaraunt for a better one.~~#~0
an absolute atrocity to all that is good and edible. you will see bundt cake straight from KFC. and what is up with the sushi roll with strawberries in it?!~~#~0
I was sooooo disappointed!  I really cannot rate the food as I never got to eat. I live in Tucson and my family is mostly in the east  valley of Phoenix and I have been waiting for 2 years to go into downtown and eat at Matt's. I go and put my name on the waiting list. Other parties of 2 come after me and the guy kept sitting people that had been there for 20-30 minutes and I had been waiting exactly 1 hour. What really upset me is that I saw him seat 3 people at tables for 2 and when I walked in said he couldn't sit 3 there when there were others seated that way (i think he knew them).  I am truly disappointed as I've been waiting like I said for "2" years to eat there. If you have a party of more than 2, like a mere 3, you'll wait forever!~~#~0
I was given a prepaid detail as a gift. I made my appointment, took my White truck to be detailed. They called me a few hours later and said it was ready to be picked up. I inspected my truck when I got home, I only live a mile from this location; my truck looked horrible. Wheel wells-not cleaned(still had dirt in them), bed of the truck-not clean(still had dirt in it), tires-looked terrible due to whatever the slime was that they sprayed on them, interior- don't even think it got vacuumed(found a peanut and white dog hair, I have a black dog that I do not let ride in my truck), they left spots on my floormats from where they cleaned one spot(didn't clean the entire mat), my dash was covered in that nasty slime, & my rearview mirror and visor mirror still had fingerprints on them. All that isn't the worst part, the thing that made this a horrible place to get a detail is that they had actually managed to Swirl a WHITE truck. How do you swirl a white truck? I would hate to see what they would have done had I taken in a dark colored vehicle. I even found bugs on the front of my truck, I only live a mile away; I couldn't have gotten that many bugs from the drive home. I won't even go back for a carwash. I'm not sure how much was paid for my detail, but I do know that the person that paid for it got robbed.~~#~0
You can call this place Mulligan's, or Maloney's or Baloney and Cheese, but either way, it blows as hard as the water spout of Moby Dick. It could be the worst bar I have been to in Phoenix. (and I've been to The Break Room) I don't know what this bar is trying to be? a Pub, a Dance club, a Dive? Talk about identity crisis. Between the attendant in the small bathroom, and scantily clad waitresses, and the abysmal music, this place is a cross section of all that is wrong with Scottsdale bars. Let me explain:1.  The bathroom is small, do we really need a guy handing out paper towels? I don't see the need for this at all in a place like Mulligan's 2. They play the worst combination of dance/ R&B and rap music. People proceed to "dance" on the patio, (which is no dance floor, it's made of brick) and basically create fodder for the occasionally joke, or innuendo to be thrown around by people like me. I associated the dance floor with a train unloading cattle. It seemed like steer were being brought down a ramp of train car, and my friends and I were bidding on each one. As the inebriated cattle walked by, we were appalled by their excessiveness and complete disregard for themselves. Stupid Cattle. If I had a cattle prod, this would have been an ideal time to zap them into early retirement for the evening.  I would have been doing the entire town a favor. 3. This place is dark, and has a pub atmosphere, but is trying to be a dance club. Mulligan's suffers from the  $30,000 millionaire syndrome, as many young Scottsdalians do. On the outside you may be wearing Hugo Boss, but inside you are just a 27 year old Insurance Analyst. I wouldn't set foot in the place again. I am so defiant,  the CIA would have to drug me and drag my hooded and shackled to this place. I may even avoid the entire area this bar surrounds. Like a Chernobyl, this place has leaked radiation and everything around is contaminated. Best line of the night from my friend "This isn't a conducive environment."~~#~0
Well, I give the store a -1 score because the owner treated us like we were there to rip him off and didn't give a darn about our child not being able to carry the heavy case included in the rental.  He insisted in talking over me, interrupting and verbally pushed us around like a bully.  We were there to rent a drum and wanted a soft, backpack type of carrier.  He went on for 5 minutes about how the kids ruin them and it costs him $80 to replace each one every year.  When we finally got a word in edgewise that my 10 year old couldn't carry the case and drum because it is too heavy, he started ranting AGAIN how it costs him $80 to replace them.  I told him that I don't care about his $80, but that I'm concerned about my son's ability to carry the instrument and ENOUGH about his money!! He continued to be rude and we left tearing up the contract as we walked out the door.  NEVER again would I step foot into that store.  Shame on that guy for treating people like criminals and idiots.~~#~0
Have never heard a word from corporate, even an apology email would have been nice.  I'd be willing to bet they get SO MANY complaint letters they just can't keep up.  Or they just don't give a shit.  My money is on the second.~~#~0
From the other reveiews and what I have heard from a friend, I might have to try narcisse again. I was there for brunch this past sunday and was disappointed. After being seated inside, we waited 9 minutes before we were greeted. Right when we were about to get up and leave, our waitress finally appeared asking us if we would like to order a drink. I ordered a nonfat cappucino and without even asking my boyfriend what he would like, she just walked away, clearly irritated that I had ordered a cappucino. She came back a few minutes later saying they dont have nonfat milk. We just weren't feeling it so we left and went somewhere else instead. Im sure brunch is amazing but just the greeting we recieved left a bitter taste in my mouth.~~#~0
I would not give this pharmacy any stars.... Worst customer service lost my prescriptions two months in a row. Customer service is horrible, horrible, absolutely horrible....~~#~0
We have ate here before, but tonite's was the last time.  They were somewhat busy, but it was like we were invisible when we came in.  Took 10 minutes to be acknowledged and seated.  Another 10 minutes for the server to come to the table for our drink order.  Throughout the entire meal had to remind her repeatedly of things we asked for.  We had a 2 year old with us and guess who was served last?  Uncalled for!  We did not leave much of a tip because of the terrible service and to top it off after we left for the car, the manager chased behind us asking if there was a problem!  She got told everything that was wrong - why wasn't she checking while we were there?  We have never had such bad service and to be chased to your car made it even worse!~~#~0
too stuck up and over priced for Gilbert.  Needs a decent happy hour.  I'll just wait til Postinos is in Gilbert!~~#~0
This location of Verizon gave me the customer service experience equivalent  of a car wreck.~~#~0
Their coffee isnt entirely convincing, the place is more style than substance (and flavor for that matter). The place isnt big enough and unfortunately I stopped going to this place because it seems to me, given my different experiences at this place, that minorities arent welcome here given the treatment of some of its staff and patrons. Unfortunately, at such time we didnt have any other alternative but Starbucks, until Lola's Coffee opened and welcomed us with open arms. Glad to say I have never looked back. But putting their demeanor aside, their coffee isnt the best for the exorbitant prices you pay.~~#~0
As a NYC girl I have to say this is the first time I ever ordered from here and had delivery from the Surprise AZ Chain, and this will be the last time I ever order. I ordered baked Ziti and it was so dry and looked like they baked a whole pan of it and then take from the pan and Microwave it to heat it, The Ziti noodles were hard I ordered chicken wings as well I did not get any blue cheese dressing & Celery as I asked for and there Garlic Bread was definetely nuked, it is as hard as a Hardball you can not even chew it. what a waste of money. People who say this place is excellent must not be from NY...Sorry to write such a bad review but it is the truth...~~#~0
I had the basic car wash today. The plastic scratched the hood and trunk of my car. It also dropped chemicals which took paint off mycar. I took pictures. I called and left a message. I hope some one cares.~~#~0
The husband and I came here after work because I was starving.  Upon walking in, I was really excited and I felt like this was going to be a 5 star place.  The decor was simple and clean, and it kind of reminded me of my house.  Then it became a 4 star place when our order came to 23 dollars.  A little pricey for me.  I ordered a bacon cheeseburger that touted applewood smokey bacon along with a side of tater tots.  Yum!Our food arrived, and well, I subtracted another star because it was sloppy looking and frankly, a tad unappetizing.  My tots were pretty dark but I happen to like mine overcooked so they are really crispy.  Other people may be very disappointed with this.  The burger was very large, but the patty was very commercial.  My bacon was the biggest disappointment.  It was translucent!  I expected nice thick cut bacon when ordering an expensive burger.  The taste was no better than appearance.  It was incredibly grease laden, so much so that it made the bun soggy.  Additionally, I am 99.4% sure that everything they used comes from Costco.  The patties were definitely the same ones that come in a big stack with sheets of paper between them.  The bacon was definitely the kind that comes in the big giant reseable Kirkland bag.  Yikes.  Not good.  We're down to two stars.After I didn't finish eating my burger, I felt pretty gross.  It took a few minutes to sink in, but I realized I just put an immense amount of grease into my tummy.  I am not one to shy away from greasy diner breakfasts and the like, but holy crap, this was a new level.  I didn't feel well.  An hour later, I am definitely sick  Now we are down to one star.  I have a wicked stomach ache as I write this review.  Ugh.  I want to vomit so I can just get this crap out and pretend it never happened.  What a disappointment.~~#~0
This place has the worse customer service. I've given this place plenty of chances to redeem themselves, but every time I go in, I am not treated with respect. All they do is stand behind the counter and gossip. I tried selling my clothes once, and the two girls did not even go through all of my items, and just told me that they were not going to buy any of my items today. I understand that my items may not be what they were particularly looking for, but it was very rude that they were talking and laughing the whole time while I was standing there waiting for them, and they didn't even go through the entire bag. What's worse is that the girl did not even put all my clothes back into the bag, and just walked off. Sure, you can get cheap clothes here, but you can definitely find better used items and customer service from elsewhere.~~#~0
TERRIBLE! Everything was either fried or so salty I could not even eat it. The atmosphere was nice, laid back and stylish but the food was not good. I got the tofu with veggies and brown rice and it was so salty I could even take more than 2 bites. We also the hummus and pita as an appetizer. The pita chips were FRIED and so greasy! I left with a stomach ache. Very disappointed. I came all the way from the bay area to try this place and will not recommend to vegan friends or anyone else. Sorry guys! Need to go with fresh local produce menu and help make vegans proud... help all people  eat healthy...not stuff them with fried processed food that will contribute to America's obesity problem. Good luck!~~#~0
I don't complain. Plan and simple. I've never complained about service, or anything related before.First off... we were seated in the "sunny seats". We were told it was the only seat. Whatever... didn't care too much. Not too big of a deal. It was 113* today, and you could for sure feel the heat off the window. When the manager walked by, she apologized for the hot seats and explained that they should have a tinted window like the rest of the restaurant in no time. OK... so don't you think that the table maybe shouldn't be there?Anyway.WORST SERVER EVER. Yes, we were seated in the sunny seats. 4-6 waiters walked by us several times. I asked the hostess for water when we were sat (I'm not exaggerating how hot it was) and it took at least 5-6 minutes to get some water on the table. Our server brought the water, with no straws and simply walked away. Every single person in my party downed their water in under 5 minutes and I was never ONCE refilled my entire visit. After placing our order, the waiter was so rude & I was so hot... I asked the hostess to  make mine to go. When the manager walked by a second time we let her know how rude and short the waiter was. She observed him rudely taking our order & walked back to us and said: "I'm sorry. He's usually really good. I don't know what's up with him tonight". Are you freaking kidding me? His service never got better and the MANAGER did NOTHING to make it right. She even walked my to go box over to the table herself.  Here's what she needs to do right: fire him. There's plenty jobless people who would do a heck of a job compared to him. But however, after more explanation below, staff members who are bad are a reflection of a bad manager. She was fully aware how upset we were. We left, with not too much tip. There was no way I'd give that man a dime. I thought about how awful this was on the way home & decided to call once I was home. I spoke with the manager and she knew who I was. She apologized about "hot sunny table" & I explained my thoughts on how that ONE table should not be used. All it's going to do tomorrow is make someone else mad. Most of all, I said the table would have been NO big deal if we had a human being as a waiter. She agreed, apologized and said she was "going to give us a free dessert but it was just so busy she didn't get to it in time before we left". Guess what... didn't want dessert... it would have melted & we wanted to get the heck out! She offered me a free salad for my next visit. I nicely told her there was NO WAY I was going to return. I asked for her to return the money on my credit card and she said there was no way they could do that. I then said that I'd gladly drive the 15 minutes back to have my card refunded, that evening when I got around to it. I'm so upset nothing was done the first time we informed the manager that something wasn't right. What's odd is she agreed with us the whole time and STILL did nothing about it. Never switched waiters, never gave free drinks, NEVER REFILLED EMPTY WATER glasses, just didn't do anything. Due to this experience, I'll be contacting the owner with my experience. NEVER ever have I written a negative review on ANYTHING in my life, until this. Needless to say I'm very sad about this. I love their food, I think it's the best Italian on the west side. Unfortunately I don't think I can ever go back, not until some new management whips it into shape.~~#~0
It's not just the one worker that an above poster mentioned that has a bad attitude, it's about 99% of the workers in the store.  As a customer, you SHOULD NOT be able to tell who hates their job or who hates working with customers just by looking at them.The worst ones are the above mentioned "Marilyn" and one of the courtesy clerks.  EVERY time I go in and I have the misfortune of being helped by either one of them, they always have a miserable look on their face with tons of attitude to boot.  I made a comment to one of the cashiers about the Courtesy Clerk's bad attitude, and she just laughed it off with "oh, well she's just extremely shy".  I'm not buying that.  I think it's more she's just a miserable witch with a "B" sting.  Even if it's true, is working with the public on a daily basis the wisest vocational path to take?!~~#~0
Dear Phoenix,The psychiatrist called and you are certifiably insane.Why are you as crazy as a coconut? The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.Arizona Center? Entire second-story "food court" is now offices. Huge turnover in retail tenants. Nothing faces the street. FAIL.Mercado? Does anyone even know what businesses were originally here? FAIL.Collier Center? Never built out in its entirety. Number of businesses are not easily accessible from street. FAIL.CityScape? Ginormous blank wall facing street. Pedestrian skyway allows people to "leave" Phoenix streets for "safety" of "mall-like atmosphere." Probably going to FAIL.Downtown Phoenix will thrive when planners FINALLY realize that a great downtown consists of vibrant street life, one-of-a-kind retail/eateries/bars/entertainment venues (housed in equally unique physical spaces) and - most important of all - the overarching creation of the kind of all encompassing urban environment whereby pedestrians are free to get lost, explore and feel enchanted by the spaces surrounding them. CityScape, unfortunately, fails to help Phoenix achieve a single one of the aforementioned elements of a great downtown or, excuse my thievery, cityscape.Why do you even call this massive development CityScape from the start? I mean, isn't a cityscape supposed to be the sum total of the city's built environment? Here, it looks like CityScape (I hope you're paying attention to my purposeful capitalization) is simply attempting to be a cartoon of a cityscape.Your treatment plan: take two Prozacs (make sure to buy them at the exciting, new CVS drugstore), and then - when you're in a more stable frame of mind - figure out how to get some amazing, interesting, unique, totally cool, only-in-Phoenix, Phoenician tenants to occupy the beautiful Luhrs buildings across the street from your latest architectural and urban planning disaster.Get well soon,Sanity~~#~0
No wifi?!?!? SHAME!!!!!!!~~#~0
I cant imagine a chain that is so poorly run, but it is.  I have never had a delivery order without either a mistake in my order or a half raw pizza crust.  Wait times are insane, the staff not helpful at all for any reason.  Last time I called for delivery they forgot to put my order in period and then discounted me 20% for my trouble, as if that makes up for a 90 minute wait time.  While I prefer Pizza hutt pizza in general, I would much rather go to Domino's or Papa John's because it really is unbearable.~~#~0
The pizza was soggy, cold and when I think of a chicken caesar pizza, I think of flat bread with a fresh salad and grilled chicken, not blah bottled dressing under greasy, cold cheese and nary a lettuce leaf in sight.It took too long on top of it.~~#~0
OMG! Don't....just DON'T. The initial presentation was great! I loved it, and loved the two people I worked with to set it all up...although neither of them work here anymore. I've been here 2 months and the office staff have already pissed me off enough to the point I have to go directly to the manager for anything I need. I find the team apologizing for their incompetence on a regular basis. I have heard so many apologies that today, actually had to tell them to STFU and save the BS. I feel horrible having to sound-off on them but dammit, they keep asking for it. I NEVER grant permission to enter my apartment for service requests, yet they have entered my apartment without consent TWICE!!! First time was about a week in. They set off my alarm, the police were dispatched and they said it was a "miscommunication". I never submitted a service request, verbal or otherwise. I simply made them aware that I heard a noise I couldn't quite identify. The 2nd time was just a few weeks ago for a service request to spray the patio (WHICH IS OUTSIDE) for scorpions....ANOTHER problem here. The outside contractor was able to just walk into the office and get my house key as if he were ordering a #2 at the drive thru. No questions asked..just "HERE YA GO!"  Why the hell would he need to enter when he can just hop over the patio wall.....IT WAS AROUND THE CORNER AND I'M ON THE FIRST FLOOR...ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!??? Those exact instructions were given to the office staff the day before....WTF! I found it strange that the office staff didn't accompany the contractors in or check the work for quality prior to them leaving or at all. I guess I hoped for that in a community like this. Now, after the 1st time they went into my apartment without permission, I ripped some asses open and had my file thoroughly documented to state "NO PERMISSION TO ENTER....EVER!!"...yet, it happened again! Naturally, I hit the roof and handled it directly with the manager. Financial compensation was granted towards rent as it should have been. I thought that was the end of it. My bathroom has already had to be retiled due to water leaks. Anytime someone uses the crapper on this side of the building, a loud banging noise can be heard within the walls.Today,  they couldn't even show up to change the air filter. I made an appt yesterday and when they didn't show I called to find out why. Figures the adolescents working in the office had no idea it was scheduled and offered information of no use. Their solutions was to reschedule. UM...HELLO...YOU DIDN'T SHOW UP FOR THIS APPT.....WHY SHOULD I BELIEVE THE NEXT TIME WOULD BE ANY DIFFERENT??? Stupidity...you can't fix it, can you? End result = me walking over there to get the filters and doing it myself. I've spared the details of all the things that weren't done when I moved in.....but I'll just say there was a list....ON DAY FRIGGIN ONE! In all fairness, I will clarify that this is not the maintenance team..they are very nice. This is about the management. They aren't rude, but damn they F things up like it's an office policy. $1200 for an apartment that needs repairs on a weekly basis complete with miscommunicated and frustration along the way....Sound about right? .....it's really too bad. I wanted this to be home for at least a few years.~~#~0
Siu Wok has been a favorite for quite some time.  Sadly, today's experience knocked them off the list.My co-workers and I decided we needed a tasty meal today so we placed a delivery order through Siu Wok.  We were happy when the meal arrived much sooner than the 45-minute delivery estimate.  Our food was hot and smelled delicious.  We were all enjoying our food when one co-worker made a stomach-turning discovery: a dead fly in her food.  We all immediately stopped eating, repulsed by the large fly nestled up to a sliced carrot.I immediately called Siu Wok to complain and spoke with Jennifer.  I told her what happened and asked for a refund on the entire order.  She said she could refund the contaminated meal but would have to speak with the manager for authorization on the other two.  She called back a few minutes later and said she was only given permission to refund the $7.95 for the extra-protein meal.  She seemed to understand why I was disappointed but said her hands were tied.  I asked her to relay to management that I was very disappointed in his lack of attention to the matter and that Siu Wok had just lost a considerable amount of business, as our office frequently places orders there.Instead of Siu Wok being out $23.44, they have lost an office full of customers and gained a negative Yelp review.  Doesn't the fly look delicious??~~#~0
Sad.  So sad.We've been looking for GOOD Chinese since moving to Scottsdale three years ago. So, after checking with Yelp and reading such glowing reviews, I recommended Totties, and noticing they have a new location nearer to home, we went to Totties 2.Now I'm wondering if I was in the same restaurant as my fellow Yelpers who gave it 5 Stars. Atmosphere was upscale and pretty. We were seated, and asked if we wanted something to drink. They have beer and wine on the menu, but we'd walked through a full bar/lounge area on the way to our table. We asked what kind of Vodkas were available. Our server was befuddled and left to retrieve the bartender who could better advise and take our order. This should have been a sign of what to expect. The bartender arrived in short order, and informed us the upper end of their inventory would be Absolute. Not thrilled, we persevered and ordered one on the rocks. No inquiry re garnish, Drink arrived sans garnish and when we asked for olives, they had none. Bartender apologized and said this was only his fourth day. We thought - "OK, this is Totties 2 - we've caught them in the throes of a new operation and they're just working the bugs out. We'll cut them some slack" - becoming empathetic to their plight.On to the meal. We ordered Hot and Sour Soup and Totties Pork Spring Rolls. Spring rolls arrived, four presented on a very large platter, more than half of which was very strangely covered with green leaf and mache lettuce. Spring rolls were just OK, and my thought was these were from Sysco rather than the implied home made by Tottie. The Hot and Sour Soup was an enormous portion - obviously meant for two. It was mediocre at best, and had a consistency and texture that again lead me to think this was not freshly prepared but more out of a plastic bag provided by some food service company. For us, Kung Pao is generally a good gauge of preparation. This version didn't have the traditional peanuts, BUT it did have zucchini. Very odd. Finally, I tried the Egg Foo Yung, and asked for it to be prepared with pork. Large portion, but nothing special. Drowning in brown sauce. (One thing that struck us as strange, all the food was the same brown color.) Toward the end of the meal, we received a visit from a woman who turned out to be Tottie herself. We introduced ourselves, and inquired how long the new location had been open. She replied "Six months" when we more expected her to say 'six days'. We were more than a little aghast. For us, Totties 2 was just a sad thing all around. Our quest for decent Chinese continues.~~#~0
The ONLY thing I like about this dinasour is entering through the kitchen.Unfriendly bartenderS, two of them, food is ok, but let's not go crazy here, it's not great.  Just another "institiution" that gets a free pass because...I don't know why they get a free pass.The red-flocked wall paper is older than dirt; so are the waitresses.  Just so mediocre.  So many other places to go.~~#~0
About once a year I say to myself, I like Serranos, but I wish there was one closer to my apartment.  Then the memories that I have sealed return, saying Hey, what about the terrible one on Val Vista and Guadelupe roads?  It's the same local chain, surely all your previous visits were aberrations, and it will rebound to approach the quality at the other locations.No.Chips and bean dip are consistently room temperature or cooler, service is generally inattentive.  Enchiladas tasted microwaved.  Water glasses and plates were dirty.  Albondigas watery.  30 minutes to get check.  I just don't understand how this location is so much worse than the rest.  Hope betrayed too many times, just pack it up at this location.  Shut it down!~~#~0
Honestly, I don't know why there's two different pages for the same restaurant, but regardless this restaurant is CLOSED!I would've given the restaurant three stars for inconsistent service, but hurry up and mark this closed so you don't give false hope of close seafood.~~#~0
I have written about Banfield before, but we have another saga to this ongoing problem.  I am now giving up on this stupid place and urge you guys to NEVER go there eitherWe have always taken our dog to Banfield Animal Hospital/Clinic in PetsMart for her vacinations and check-ups. In February of 2008, we took her again because she was acting very lethargic, her skin was very scaly, no appetite, etc. They did a blood work-up and said her Thyroid was acting up again. With all the bloodwork and office/vet visit, it cost us $450.00. Her Thyroid was high, so they gave us medication, but said we needed to come back in two weeks and have her blood tested again. We did this at least two more times.On Sat., April 5th, our dog was very sick and would keep her tail between her legs, not eat, was extremely lethargic, would hunch her back when she would stand up, and was constipated also. All these symptoms and more were told to the vet and we were told that all these were symptoms that her Thyroid was still out of whack. By this time, it had been 2 1/2 weeks since her blood test and we were never contacted with the results. They claimed they never got the results and had to call the place that did the tests and they had to run the test again. The vet tells me she didn't have a clue as to why our dog was keeping her tail between her legs. She said our dog must be nervous. Our dog has never ever done that before. Anyway, the vet sent us home just saying all this was from the Thyroid problem.We brought our dog home and on Sun., (April 6th) I woke up and there was blood all over the quilt my dog sleeps on. We had to take her to an Emergency Animal Clinic and found out she had burst an anal gland. They took care of that to the tune of $158.00 and immediately she was back to her normal self, which we were grateful for.. The papers said we should take her to the vet the next day, so I called Banfield, and was told I couldn't get in until this afternoon because they were full with appointments. I said I needed to get in earlier than that, so they said to come in right away. I got in there and there wasn't a soul in the place.A different vet than we had on Saturday came in and I told her how ticked off I was at the results of Saturday's visit and then what happened on Sunday. She checked our dog and made excuses as to why the other vet did not check her bottom. I did not agree with her and told her how I felt. I told this vet that I felt I should not have to pay for this office visit and finally she agreed, so that was one good part, since we have paid close to $1,000.00 since February. The part that ticked me off the most though, was having our dog in there on Saturday and they never checked our dog in the area they should have and had no idea why her tail was between her legs and did a horrible job.I had called PetsMart groomers to cancel our dog's haircut because of these problems and told the groomer what was going on and she asked me who the vet was and I told her Banfield. She said never to go to Banfield again. They are very bad and overcharge the customer tremendously. I can only say, do not take your dog there. They must hire their vets from the bottom of the barrel.You should put Banfield Pet Hospital Corporation into your search engine and go to a site that shows "I'm Pissed".  You will see what this corporation has done to animals and what people think of Banfield.  Again, I'm marking one star because I have to in order to post this.~~#~0
I was referred to Kachina Dry Cleaners by the gang at Park Avenue DC (my regular dry cleaners) on Indian School Rd. What a sad experience! The lady at the counter was so rude that after I dropped off my "special" items a pair of newly purchased thermal drapery panels - I almost went back in and asked for them back. In hindsight, I should have followed my instincts!Since the items had to be "sent out" and were over two weeks in the processing - I called three days past the promised date to be screamed at by the lady who answered the telephone. She yelled, "did anyone call you?" When I replied "no" but the ETA was three days ago ...she slams  down the telephone, returning 5 minutes later - saying, "yeah they're here" and hangs up!My husband picked the drape up the next day - the cost was twice what was quoted...the items were not pressed, still having the original wrinkles from the packaging AND they have glue-like spots all over them. These drapes were brand new and in perfect conditions sans the packaging wrinkles...The customer service staff is terrible - and the dry cleaning services are worse. Do not use this dry cleaner for anything that you don't mind throwing away!~~#~0
The first time I visited was a vacation here, before I moved.  We had rented a car for our vacation here in Arizona and visited Game Works one night for fun.  After we were done visiting game works we noticed that the rental car we had was keyed on one side so needless to say we had to pay a hefty fee to get it fixed.  We thought "eh..stuff happens" so we visited the mall after we moved here and came out to see our own car was in fact keyed.  After that we have tried to avoid this mall unless we really have to visit a store inside and if so we only go during the day. I would not recommend this mall unless you HAVE to go there.~~#~0
As we discovered this past weekend this place is closed.~~#~0
Visited Sunflower last night in search of Scharffen Berger chocolates.  Nay on SB chocs, but you may find organic (Green &amp; Black's, Love, Newman's Own, etc.) in the impulse buy sections.  I sampled a peanut milk chocolate cluster and an almond chocolate cluster at the bulk section and decided I'd get some peanut ones.  I already had a plastic bag open and was about to jot down the item number on a label twisty-tie when I spotted something moving at the corner of my eye... I lifted the peanut chocolate cluster bin lid to have a look, and there was a 1/2- inch maggot doing its dance on one of the bin's walls!!  I dropped the lid shut, stared at the bugger to see if I wasn't just seeing things, lifted the lid back up and pinched it off the bin's wall with the plastic bag in hand, and handed the bag to a clerk and told him where I found it.  The manager on duty was close by so I repeated everything that transpired to her.  She said she'd empty and sanitize the bin immediately.  I didn't hang around to see if she did anything.Ugh!  I'm getting shivers up and down my spine typing this just now!!  BTW, I had a look into the freezer aisles a few weeks ago to have a look at the Berto gelato selections and they ALL have a horrible case of freezer burn.  Looks like a pretty low turnover rate...  I'll try to see if Sunflower still carries Laloo goatmilk ice cream, but, honestly, I can't see myself going there anytime soon after the maggot incident...---Update: Just recalled that Sunflower never sold Laloo... I found Laloo's goatmilk ice cream at Whole Foods and AJ's Fine Foods.  Sorry for misleading!~~#~0
Where to begin... hmmm how about a gay bar in a shopping center?  What the hell is wrong with Scottsdale??? The entire experience with BS West was.. well BS.  I think the easiest way to explain my frustration is just bullet points, otherwise I'll get carried away... *Parking - A freaking mess. *Staff - Rude as crap. *Capacity - I understand wanting to make money off the cover.. but having wayyyy too many people inside there is not fun, and also just not safe, they HAD to be over capacity the night I went. *Customers - ugh. Suburban Hell.  It was cute annoying little twinks, their very annoying str8 girlfriends, and some awkward housewives who stumbled in on the way home from Applebees. All in all, I guess this would be an ideal club for someone who's... 18-22.  A twink would love this place, but I've apparently passed over that point in life.. I like my gay bars alittle grittier, the biggest issue was the shopping mall feel for me.~~#~0
Wow... I haven't been to this place in a year.  There's a reason.  When Moira first opened, I waited a few weeks then went down there to check it out.  The sushi wasn't bad.  It was actually okay. The reason I think it was even okay was because, like many others... I WANT to like it.  I've lived downtown for 15+ years and we're starving for an outstanding sushi spot... okay... even a "decent" sushi spot.  It didn't happen with Moira.The first few times I went there... the food wasn't too shabby... but then... OOPS... not so good.  I've now gone there a couple of times and received FOUL sushi.  I'm not joking.  The icing on the cake was the last time my bf and I went there and the tuna sashimi was served to us in a VERY LARGE portion.  We were both excited... at first.  Then quickly realized that the fish was definitely past its expiration.  UGH... the smell was SO BAD.  When we alerted the server of this they told us that they'd see if they could take it off the bill.  Uh... we were NOT about to pay for this foul smelling tuna.  I mean who in their right mind would eat this?  In the end, they agreed to not have us pay for that dish.  What I thought was pretty screwed up was that they served this to us thinking that we were idiots and some stinky tuna would just fly under the radar.  NOPE!Btw, the above experience isn't the only one.  I had a previously bad experience on NYE 2 years ago... and should have not gone back... but I chalked it up as one bad incident and thought I'd be open minded, since I really wanted to like it.The only thing I could say positively about the place was that the sake menu was pretty good.  But to be honest with you... great sake is only a few steps away at Sens... along with some really tasty eats.I truly want to have a great sushi place downtown here... why can't we get it?  I'm willing to pay a good price for exceptional food.  When will that exceptional sushi spot come to downtown PHOENIX?!~~#~0
Bud and his crew made one too many mistakes on my little SUV and would not warrant the work they did.  It ended up costing me $300 for a tow from 100 miles away.  Bud's crew told me to "have it towed back and they'd take care of me".  They fixed the problem...something they didnt do right in the first place...but would not help me with the cost of the tow.  They also did work on my clutch and it chatters horribly.  I will have another company look at it.  Not Bud's.  Steer clear.~~#~0
BORING, FLAVORLESS, OVERPRICED CRAP; exposed-filament bulbs, paper napkins, sans s/p shakers. Kale- and collard-earthy and squishy garnishes little better than pig fodder.--sealed brown concrete, minimalist 5x7 postage-stamp art in monochromatic, rhythmically-spaced repetition--exposed-filament bulbs throughout give that yellowish glow evocative of kidnap cinema;--gangsta buser keeps glaring at us, slamming our glasses down after refilling them; oh, maybe we won't get out of here alive!--going to charge me $17 for pasta? buy some GODDAM cloth napkins!--"table bread" is a plastic package of stale, pencil-thick breadsticks. what would you think if someone brought you two packs of saltines? Yeah, that's what I mean!--ambient music an unpleasant mix of rural-southern Creole woo-woo ritual chant, washboard-and-spoon percussion and harmonica (I think they recruited that woman from the GTA3 shanty town);--outside, the manager is explaining to the police amidst an army of tow trucks that these cars really are valet-professionally parked, not by their owners.--heirloom tomato side dish was the one delicious thing. At $3, the best value on the menu (+1 star)...--unfortunately the spices were so old there was no flavor left in them.--no s/p shakers; on request we received two contact-lens cups of s/p for pinching, chef style (i.e. no spoons).On our way out, some employee was being disciplined on the back steps, presumably about to quit.I've never been so glad to quit a place as this.~~#~0
Another Groupon fail. It is totally unprofessional to offer a Groupon when you cannot accomodate the clients. All the other reviews are totally accurate. I will be complaining to Groupon and requesting a refund.~~#~0
Had high hopes, but we were very disappointed in Blue Hound.My husband treated me to VIP tickets for Train at Comerica so I treated him to dinner prior to the show....so wanted this place to be great.Our creds: late 30's executives...DINK's so we enjoy fine dining often. Favorite Gastro-pub in Valley: Citizen Public House Scottsdale...also love Cowboy Caio in Scottsdale.Pros:- walking distance to downtown venues- industrial chic decor- best cocktail menu I have ever seenCons:- Ironically, the food. Appetizers: pork bellies and cheddar biscuit apps. Pork bellies...we KNOW pork bellies...all over foodie menus across town...these were like rubber bacon. If you want fantastic pork bellies, go to Citizen Public House or Arrogant Butcher. Cheddar biscuits were good but nothing interesting. Dinner: husband had pork neck..it was nice looking but very ordinary and bland. I had Fried Quail...it was yummy...tasted exactly like KFC...came with cold corn bread, cold gravy and precisely 5 cold beans...could not taste the foie gras in the cornbread. Husband asked for bread to have with his pork neck soup...server said they didn't have bread but he would ask the kitchen...he came back with 2 tiny crostinis in a soup bowl...dry, tasteless, odd.- The service. Hostess (on 9/30 at 5pm) tried to seat us in an almost empty dining room at the one table right next to the table bussing station. REALLY? We asked for another table and she said we can't have any other table because she had to save those for groups of 4...completely understood so we took a table in a far corner. 5 minutes later she sat a couple at the 4-up...she was also unfriendly and didn't seem to want to be there. Our server was blah and wasn't at all passionate about the menu options...Servers at Arrogant Butcher are awesome!In closing...if you want a fantastic foodie meal in downtown, go to Arrogant Butcher...if you are in Scottsdale, go to Citizen Public House..ENJOY!~~#~0
Saturday night, reservations for 15 at 8:30. We arrived at 8:35 (damn Central construction) to find that our reservations were already gone. After some "discussion" with the staff, I got them to give us a table for 10 and a couple of extra cushions. Not too great of a start, but I tried to keep an open mind.The food: kinda disappointing. We ordered the hummus/pita, the garlic rosemary fries, and the sweet potatoe fries for apps. The hummus wasn't too bad, but I wouldn't say it was any better than the stuff you get at any grocery store. They gave us a huge heaping helping of it, but only 7 pita triangles. Then they charged us a ridiculous amount for 7 more. The garlic fries were, to say the least, GARLICY! I love garlic, but this was a little too much! The sweet potato fries were good, but the sauce that came along with them was basically frosting in a cup (not my thing, but other people liked it). After that, I gave up on the food and tried to focus on the important things, like the drinks.The drinks were pretty good, but expensive. A manhattan ended up costing $13.50 and a martini was at least $9.50. I ordered the pear martini, which sounded good in the description... not my cup of tea! They had dried pear in the bottom of the glass which ended up looking like (and I apologize for being gross) the intestine of a mouse. The drink was super sugary and nothing I'd order again.But i must say: It was nicely decorated, the service was okay, and had ample parking. But I don't think it will be a place I will frequent, only if my friends make me again.~~#~0
I hope the people who wrote reviews before me are just kidding. This cafe is awful and overpriced. maybe we're not talking about the same place?i once got 2 slices of wheat toast and a large diet coke. how much did it cost? $7.50! this place has nasty microwaved food for way more than any of it is worth. they go to costco and buy things, then wrap them up and sell them for $2-4 a piece.I once brought my dinner to class but needed a fork. they wanted to charge me for a fork. this place makes me angry, all the people who work there are slow and dumb. there's a jack in the box up the street and when we have time to leave we go there and are much happier and don't spend $7 on something like a microwaved soft pretzel.~~#~0
Being in the restaurant business I talk to a lot of delivery people who see the back of the house of many places.  They all tell me it is the dirtiest chain they have ever seen.~~#~0
Have you ever had the feeling like your wife might be slipped something while ordering a drink, or molested on the way to the can? That is how I felt while celebrating a birthday here. The place was down right creepy. Don't get me wrong, I love me a dive bar. I can eat on the curb in Mexico. I am a very trusting person. I hated this place. The drinks were ok, ther servers were not attentive, the decor and outside sitting area was cool.~~#~0
Much has changed in the two years since my initial review.  Apparently Nick's has decided to toss customer service out the window.  I should have known it would be a problematic visit when it took nearly 15 minutes to be acknowledged to put in our order.  Well, it only got worse.  After nearly 45 minutes of waiting, we realized that our food was never, ever going to arrive.  Ever.  Time to leave, and never come back.  Ever.~~#~0
I talked my family in to going there for my birthday. I am one of those people who can eat anything with out getting sick. This place did the trick! I was sick for 24 hours. If you take the fryer out of that restaurant they won't be able to cook at all. Even the dinner roll saw the inside of the deep fryer! I so wanted it to be good. Very sad it wasn't!~~#~0
After years of enjoying this place, from Camelback road to here, I will never go back.  The waiter took 10 minutes to return our Visa, the place was empty, so we asked the mgr what was the holdup. He lost his temper so badly! "Are you accusing my staff of stealing?" he asked us. We expected him to say, "hold on and I'll go check on it" not to go off on us for a reasonable question.  Our jaws dropped.  He was so nasty and borderline unstable. He invited us to never come back, thought we were on Punked.  God forbid someone actually complain, he might throw them out. Still waited longer for the credit card after that.  We were too stunned to ask to see another mgr, just left in shock.  Bad attitude and average food, skip it. Too many nice business owners to give hard earned money.~~#~0
If i could give zero stars I would. Greg, who I assume is the manager, (although acts far from it), is the biggest ass on earth. He is rude, condecending and perhaps a bit racist. I had to go here three times due to stupidly purchasing a living social deal for oil changes. Each time I have made an apt and had to wait 2 hours for my car, while others come after me and leave before. He never looks at me or uses my name, just points at it. He has no idea what customer service is. Today, I got up and saw from the window that my car was finally done. He sees me in line, (a long line), and says, "your car will be done soon". I pointed out the window and said, "it's right there, that's why I'm in line". He had a stupid look on his face. Then asked, "but your car is the gold one". Seriously....I don't know my own car?!? So I finally snapped and said, "it's the one outside"!. Three times today he had to ask what car it was, even despite the fact it was written down infront of him, and I told him the two times prior. Please do yourself a favor and avoid at all costs. They are unprofessional, rude and I don't think they know what they are doing. Greg should be fired a long time ago!!~~#~0
The drinks were too weak, what is advertised as hot is not. We had the Shrimp Diablo which was bland (as were the home made tortilla). We were one drink and out..~~#~0
We went to Sandstone for the first time becasue of all the great review in the paper and other media outlets.  They noted a "great chef" on site.  We attended the night of a Suns game to have a great neighborhood atmosphere...it was bad!First the place only had 3 people working, it is a bar by the way, a bartender, a server, and a prep cook...we waited until half time of the game for our food...we should have walked out,btw we were the first customer in the bar and ordered first....Food was poor.  They said homemad onion rings, they were cold and pre-cooked, chips were good...my wife ordered a pasta dish from the menu, and the bartender said he has never heard of it, so she got a kids hamburger, ok.  son got fajita's all fat....I ordered fish and they did not have it, I got a salad...They still took over an hour to get us our food.Sorry no one should go there, will not go back.~~#~0
Happy frickin birthday to me. Got a gift from my daughter that she purchased at Worst Buy. I had already bought one for myself from Amazon (a much better choice btw). Went to return it, and didn't want cash, just store credit. And no, didnt have the receipt, it was a frickin gift you Worst buy bung holes. Got to stand in the return line twice and still denied. Product not opened or used. Have been a Best Buy credit card holder for a few years- NO MORE. Was pretty much treated like a criminal. If I am going to be treated like a criminal, maybe I and all the rest of you should act like one. Everyone that has had lousy customer service lately, and by glancing at this board, it seems like a lot of folks, bring your trash to your local Worst Buy and dump it by their door. Trash begets trash.  BTW Worst Buy people, My daughter found the receipt and we will be getting a refund, not store credit. We will forever more spend our money elsewhere. To all the treated like crap ex customers:Dump your trashCancel your credit cardBuy your Chinese crap at a different Chinese crap store. Best/Worst Buy used to be customer freindly, now they suck because BEST/WORST BUY IS CIRCLING THE DRAIN. They are desparate and THEY WILL BE GONE SOON, just like Circuit City. Their stock is crap, Glad I dumped mine quite a while back. If you own any, sell now before it becomes worthless. ANyone, Everyone, Please forward and post anywhere you like. FB for starters.~~#~0
Do you know why there are zero stars checked?  BECAUSE THIS PLACE IS NOT OPEN ON THE WEEKENDSMy life plan:  "vacation" studying at new and exciting coffee shops and bars with the BDF (best drink friend, which is not the same as bast food friend) while we work on the weekends.  Two times I tried to go her, and two times I was denied.  I thought the closure was temporary the first time I went.  It was Historic Homes tour day... so I thought the private event was the reason it was closed on a saturday.  But this weekend, low and behold.... I still could not go!  Closed!  Every weekend!  No people in the old town componenet of Mesa -- which it too bad because it has a kickass yarn store and tons of potential.Will add stars if my impending weekday visit really knowcks my socks off.  A penalty for th no weekend service will remain.~~#~0
Went here in May 2010.  Despite being busy service was good. The beer selection was fantastic including several solid IPA's.The food tasted fine.  We had the philosopher's pie pizza and a vegetarian one.What ruined the experience for us was literally being ill afterwards.~~#~0
Sorry to leave a bad review since these seem to be nice people, but my experience here wasn't good. I took in a high-end CD player that wasn't reading discs, and paid a $25 diagnostic fee. A couple days later the guy phones me and says the unit needs a new laser assembly, but he can't do it because he only has one of the two calibration discs required to do the job. He recommends I send it to the Sony facility in Laredo TX. I look at the reviews for the Sony facility and they're *horrid*. I decide to try one more thing, and contact an SACD "modder" I found through Audio Asylum. This guy says he can fix the unit, but he suggests I open it up and clean the pickup lenses before going through the trouble of shipping the unit to him. Long story short, the thing works like a champ now. I don't think I could trust DynaTronics to give me competent advice at this point, especially on audiophile gear. Sorry~~#~0
We decided to give this place a try for lunch as we were looking for some place different as we were downtown checking out the half Marathon.  We were excited to hear that they had 40+ beers on tap, but the price of beer was pretty high, $6.00.  We then ordered garlic bread which I hate to say but it was the equivalent of cardboard. The sauce on the side was decent but the bread is something they should be embarrassed about.  We then ordered a cheese pizza for the table.  Ehhhh, is all I can say about it. I kept wishing we went some where else and felt bad that I thought this place would work for us. AAnother odd thing I thought was they said they don't do refills on Root Beer.  To sum it up, overpriced, food is very under whelming and service was Ok.~~#~0
I can't believe I have to give a star to this place in order to provide a review.Had the worst restaurant experience, EVER, at this establishment.  The food was a nightmarish mess.  It was so bad it was hysterical!  Service was absolutely 3rd world!  The nerdy waitress had the nerve to overcharge our table $40.  The manager stumbled out bellowing, "What's your problem now?!" "FIRST OF ALL, we aren't pleased with the food and the waitress overcharged us." I retorted."Well get out, we're closing in 20minutes anyway!" he snickered.Long story short --- this place is an overrated outhouse.~~#~0
I've tried to stay from reviewing America West because I worked here as a flight attendant. It's been years, though, and I'm still telling horror tales of my time here. I started here as a young, fresh-eyed girl that couldn't wait to travel and see new places. I left jaded and bitter more scared of flying than I had ever been before. I made lots of good friends and met lots of amazing people but everyone seemed unhappy with their job, pay, benefits, etc. I'll summarize by telling you this. . . . We had a joke contest  going around coming up with new company slogans. Mine won. It was "America West. Where departure times are just a suggestion".~~#~0
Horrible Experience!  Waiter lacked manners and was more interested in getting a date with the table next door then he was to making sure other tables were taken care of. Went there Monday evening for my boyfriends birthday.  Been there before but never had this bad of service.  Issue with the food, but that wasn't the issue...while trying to share with the waiter what the problem was..he walked away...and manager when she showed up...didn't listen either...guess they're too busy to want repeat business....won't be giving them my monies in the future...issues happen but how they are dealt with is what matters.  Very disappointed with the waiter and manager's attention.  The only person that seemed to care was the kitchen manager and it wasn't her fault.  Guess this chain thinks that people skills are not important -Update-  the manager finally called me 3 days later...we spoke briefly-  during that conversation he was going to check into whether the server noted about the allergies...  week later and I'm still waiting for that phone call back from the manager...  He was so quick to defend the lousy service and issue with the meal that he has not contacted me back....  kept apologizing but did NOTHING TO MAKE IT RIGHT!~~#~0
I have NEVER in my life had as bad of an experience at a nail salon in my life.  My daughter had been getting her nails done here for the past few months.  Though I didn't think they did the best job, it was very conveniently located to my house.  This weekend we arrived for our nails and they were completely not ready for us and were quite rude.  She needed a fill and instead covered her acrylic nails with gel on top.  They looked horrible and started peeling that night!  When I went in to have her nails fixed they were awful..... I want everyone to be warned!!! I have never written a poor yelp review but felt so compelled this time!!!!~~#~0
First to review, now the last.Stopped by to see Hiro and Shige at "Shiro Sushi" last night and there is a note on the door."Couldn't make it through the slow times".Too bad.Hopefully we will find them elsewhere soon.TJ~~#~0
Ate the Chicken and Steak rice bowl with tempura shrimp. Began vomiting 5 hours after eating there last night. Had to miss work and still feel awful.~~#~0
Worst service I have ever received. Had to wave down the bus boy to get a drink. They had us seated, then moved us elsewhere because they said it was our fault. Then, I had to wave down a bus boy to order a drink. Rarely saw our waitress, especially when she was needed. When I did see her, she was rude and never smiled. I was with a friend who had a food allergy that they basically tried to tell her she didn't have. Her mouth was swelling up and they told her they swore they didn't put this stuff in it. Okay, well... her mouth is swelling up. Explain that to me. They did however pay for that dish, but I will not be back. I'm not even picky--~~#~0
Usually when you walk into a business like this you are greeted. I walked in and both girls sitting at the front desk were very unprofessional and straight out rude. Never again will I come here.~~#~0
This place is nothing to write home about.  Food was subpar at best.  I ordered the veggie and I must say the avocado they used was not ripe at all.  It was very chewy.  Gross...  Both myself and my friend had upset stomachs after eating here.  Will not come back.~~#~0
Still open under a new name, can't remember what it is. Haven't been there in 30 years. Used to be a place for Indians to drink until they fell down. Lots of 400 pound Indian women looking for a man. Very nasty. Had one beer there and saw a guy get knifed. Never went back. The culture here is so diverse, the liberals must love it. I'm sure the place with a new name is still the same.~~#~0
I would give a zero star if I could.  We ordered a yasu roll asking for avocado on the side yesterday and our waitress (who was super nice) went and told the sushi chef and he agreed said ok... Well when he gave us out order... Guess what... There's avocado.  So I politely told our waitress and she went and told the chief and he starts arguing with her.  Then he came and said "you want Avocado on the side???" I said "yes" he says "you don't like avocado?" I said "no" and he says "oh. Just take it out then"  what the heck?????? I've never heard of someone making a mistake on my order then telling me a simple "just take it out"  I'm such a picky eater that I don't even want avocado touching anything but my sister who was with me, LOVES avocado so that's why I asked for it to be on the side!!!!  To make matters worst, I asked him if I can have a knife so I can cut the roll in half and let me sister eat the side with avocado... He hands me a chop stick thing with a sharp edge.  Omg. I give up. I just can't take it anymore. Poor service. Instead of remaking the roll or giving us a 10% off our bill or something.Worst sushi place ever. It's because of places like this... Is why I hate trying new places!!!~~#~0
Avoid this place if you have any sense of what good barbecue tastes like. Tried the ribs last week, no flavor and very fatty.~~#~0
I've eaten here several times in the years we lived in AZ and we used to really like it.  BUT...What happened?  The prices went through the roof!!  A two taco meal with rice and beans for $10.???  Burritos were $13.???  This is Mexican food folks and in an old dive building...where are the profits going?On this visit (after the Barrett Jackson auto auction so we were starved) we ordered some basics.  The queso ($6. wow) was almost solid...more like cut a slice out of it.  The Tacos had very little meat (can you stuff more lettuce in that shell?).  The rice and beans were find, but nothing great.There are too many great Mexican food joints in AZ...don't waste your money on this one anymore.  WAY TOO EXPENSIVE~~#~0
I booked a rental through Costco Travel.....the line was extremely long( like waiting for a ride at Six Flags).If you prefer to use a debit card, they will slap $200 dollars more on hold in your account and run a credit check. I think that it's the most ridiculous thing ever. I hate the fact that I didn't get to choose my car at their garage. A slip was given to me on where my rental is parked, and I had to get to it on my own; without any personal interaction if i had any questions about the vehicle. I didn't like the Ford Fiesta they rented out to me. The breaks were making some sounds....AND!!! it was cherry red. I didn't like a cherry red car.Other companies gave you options and are more personal. Some even pull the car up for you, and help you put your luggage in the trunk.I like to be treated like a princess.Their insurance is also pretty expensive. I was shell shocked and for the very first time, i drove a rental without any form of insurance. Thank goodness, the car was alright. My damage: $152 for a 6day rental. Not bad.~~#~0
Definitely not (even) the best Korean!!! Am sorry i have to give this review but this place is a noooo.  I went there today with a friend to check it out.....We tried to get a take out menu.....it wasn't even written in ENGLISH at all (if that was really the menus) couldn't find them anyways.  So we said lets take a seat and try it.  A lovely Korean lady comes up to us try to take the order. We couldn't communicate and you know why??? She barely spoke English...Nop, sorry not even close to English.  But as a foreigner i respect that so i tried some hand techniques....   I tried to order a calamari and even though i was showing her what i was craving i end up getting some shrimp thing....was mediocre!!! There were another 2 people in the store eating, around 230pm.  I order some Korean ribs plate for around $6.95, it tasted ok and the rest of the sides didn't really excite me.  Other than that i find Korean people very friendly and nice.  I might give it another try sometime soon.~~#~0
What can be said? I've been going to the restaurant for years... YEARS! But yesterday I was thoroughly disappointed. The food has taken a major turn for the worst... Gone is the freshness, gone is the cleanliness and GONE is the tastiness. Sushi: We ordered Sashimi and a couple of roles. The one thing you expect from Sushi is freshness... Takamatsu sushi had all the indicators of DAYS in the fridge.  It was beyond belief. The fish was stale and gray. The GINGER! This stuff comes from bottles was old and smelled like pine sol... Come on man. I could have brought in fresher ginger.  Now to the main course. The bulgogi... The mainstay of Korean food... horrible. HORRIBLE I SAY. This was not bulgogi. This was super thinly sliced beef, god I hope it was beef, that had been stored in fridge and they later found and decided not to let it go to waste.  Side dishes were okay, but lacked flavor and freshness. Lastly comes the cleanliness. This should be the easiest thing to achieve in a restaurant. Don't need a pricey chef, waiter or creativity... Just need a bucket, cleaning solution, a mop and some backbone. Don't go near the bathrooms or you will find your shoes stuck to the floor like a roach motel. Don't believe me, take a sticky strole passed the sushi bar. After all was said and done and paid my fine of ~$80 to be released from Takamatsu. Lets put it this way fellow foodies. If I knew the food tasted this badly they could not have paid me $80 to eat it. Takamatsi is an embarrassment to honest Korean Restaurants in the valley.  They should close or get their act together before someone is hurt badly with their food.  If you decide to go there and get disappointed, don't blame me. I tried my best to provide you a fair warning. Thus my review... Service great  Price: $80 for two adultsCleanliness:     ...............Food Bad.... VERY Bad~~#~0
Decor was strange, service was terrible, people who worked there were aloof, like they were not in touch with reality. I had the curry and I had to rush to the restroom 20 mins after I finished eating. You wouldn't think that would happen as a result of food from a purportedly vegan restaurant. But it did. So either there ARE animal products used in making the food, or the preparation was unsanitary. Or both. Either way, I won't be back. Also, all of the religious cult propaganda was a total turn off. There's even a video in repeat. It was some sort of cross between Buddhism and some other stuff some woman, the "Supreme Master" created. I just wanted a good vegan meal, nothing more, nothing less. Sorely disappointed.~~#~0
Yikes! We went last night and some drunk girl hit her car against a big truck and hit the truck in to another car. Then a guy was stabbed in the face in the parkng lot. Buyer beware! The plus side is, the bartender Ron, poured strong,original mixed drinks.  Update to a recent post by someone else, I was there when the police where in your parking lot after the man was stabbed. I was there when the ambulance took him away. I never said the was stabbed in your bar, just your parking lot. It was quite the scene and I felt bad for the guy.~~#~0
Salon is hit or miss depending on who does your nails.  Last time that I went one nail wasn't even completely polished and the ends had not been filed smooth.  They are cheap but you get what you pay for.~~#~0
The food wasnt bad but I have made burgers that taste the same on my own grill.  Serving average burgers wouldnt be so bad if the atmosphere was fun or gave you a happy feeling but that wasnt the case either.  I really dont see what the big deal is here.  30 dollars for a couple to eat and your burger is small.... Sorry I wont be going back.~~#~0
My dear Hula's,What happened today? Maybe it was the lunch rush, but that's no excuse. Our ice tea and water tasted very weird and slightly sweetened. If you're trying out something new, it's not a good idea. our food, which consisted of a lunch salad, sandwich and sweet potato fries took forever. The fries were cold, the ahi tuna very very over cooked and hardly any pink. Please get better soon. I will probably be back, but I will make sure it's not during lunch and that I order something different.~~#~0
I loathe Wells Fargo.Long lines, huge hassles, and employees not fit to be working at a fast food joint.  I had a nice employee once.  Literally, once.  Every other time, my transactions are brutally trying.I closed my personal account years ago after getting the run-around at their downtown Glendale location.When I opened an account for my class at this particular location (only because I had to), the business accounts employee looked mortified when I handed her a couple hundred dollars in cash to deposit.  And she almost wouldn't take the change because it wasn't in rolls until I explained the idiocy of asking me to do this when there wasn't enough of each coin to make a complete roll.  Then, she kept miscounting the amount and telling me my deposit number was wrong because she couldn't understand the concept of a $2 bill.  Thankfully, she's not there anymore because she got promoted. Yup, promoted.I had to call the 800-number to try to get an untrustworthy person's credit cards canceled on one of our accounts.  Guess what they told me?  That they couldn't cancel him unless they had the number on the card, but we didn't have the cards with the numbers on them in our possession, thus the reason behind wanting them canceled.  After I pointed out the ridiculousness of this policy all I got was "I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do."Grrrr! I could go on and on because every transaction at Wells Fargo has been somewhere between aggravating and enraging.~~#~0
This place was HORRIBLE!!! Never again. I think someone said it best in their review, it was Apleebees Deluxe. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and the bun looked like someone sat on it then tasted like someone farted on it. And the pulled pork looked like something made out of a can. Dog food looks more appealing then this slop. And I ordered the onion rings instead of the fries. There was like 3 onion rings and they were ice cold. The had obviously been sitting in a heat lamp for awhile, but it was so soggy & cold, that it looked like it had been sitting there for days. Service was horrendous. The guy who served us was slow and and unattententive. He seemed uninterested in his job and it showed with his body language and attitude. The manager looked like a frumpy customer. His hair was unkept and he was dressed as if he was about to hit up the beach, not manage a restaurant. Super unprofessional looking. And then when I left for the evening, the hostess didn't even say good night or anything. I've been so accustomed to hear that now when I dine, when I didn't hear it, it just solidified my bad impression of this place. Only bright spot was the bar , which was huge and they had great drink specials. Other then that, this place is definitely a pass. Not surprised everyone else who reviewed this place also had the same experience. Hey, Cadillac Ranch management, fix your issues!!!!!~~#~0
I was excited to try this place out, and probably would have kept going back IF it weren't for my recent call to the owner regarding my expired Groupon. My Groupon, for which I paid $15, expired just THREE days ago. I called the owner, Michy, and kindly asked if she would still honor the Groupon.My experience went like this:Michy: Desert Dragon Pottery...Me: Hi, I'm calling because I had purchased a Groupon, and--{she cuts me off mid-sentence}Michy: Ok can you hold on?Me: Sure.(4 minutes on hold)I hung up and called back:Michy: I'm sorry. I was on hold with someone else, and then I forgot about you. Can I call you back?Me: Sure.She calls me back and finally I get to ask about the expired Groupon. She proceeded to tell me that I couldn't use it, but that I could get 10% off a class. Uh, no thank you. She, as the owner, had no reason to deny this request. It was 3 days ago that this expired. This shows a lack of flexibility and understanding, and a lot of greed in my opinion. For all she knows, I could have loved the class (which I paid for), and kept returning, or told all my friends about it, giving her more business.So instead, I'm yelping about it. Some people may think I am wrong to be put off by this but I think it was ridiculous for her not to honor my purchase, as well as suggesting I pay more money to this establishment for a class. 10% off. Whatever. The way I see it, I paid $15 to discover another business not worth another glance.~~#~0
Short and Sweet....Food - Mediocre at bestService - PoorI just don't get the popularity of PF Changs. Whenever I buy lunch for my office and warehouse they choose Changs. I always try a different dish and am never satisfied. How much gourmet-tized Panda express items can be had at this joint? I keep trying to find an item I could put in the memory bank for the innevitable future order for the workers. So far I have not found that dish. This is by far and wide Americanized, Sticky, Salty and Sweet Chinese food with a limited vegetable offering.  I have had the Sea Bass which was dry and refused to flake. I have had the Mushu Pork and this dish was out of the many, the better of the rest. The Duck was dry and the skin lacked that aromatic licorice roasted skin flavor. Then there is the Panda Express Staples. Orange chicken, Lemon Chicken, Sweet and Sour, Beef Mongolllian, Beef With Brocoli, Low Mein, Kung Pao etc.  It may be for you if you like that kind of food. I find it to be very overpriced for mediocre food. If it was fantastic you could not put a price on this that I would not pay. I will say, I went to the restaurant and ordered Ma Pao Tofu and it was at least better than expected. If you like more "City" style chinese food I do suggest Nee House although their  service sucks, Prime on Camelback, Jade Palace is pretty good, Hong Kong House on Mcdowell and for a nostalgic kick in the ass with relatively good ChinaTown dishes try Dragon Palace. These places are less expensive and taste much better than Changs. Heres a pointer too, if chinese chefs are cooking your food....well, who better?~~#~0
Terrible experience at Richardson's!   Uneducated, lazy, INEXPERIENCED people working here.   If you're going to charge families $80 - $100 to eat at your restaurant hire competent staff.~~#~0
First, I'm only rating 1 star because they don't have a negative 5 trillion.The fact that they use " New York" in the title is a down right insult!! New Yorkers would spit on this pizza, actually it tastes like they did! I would serve this to some ny rats but I would be scared for their health! Now for the specifics. Who do you think you are charging that much for a horrible eating experience! If you are going to charge 2 bux a topping it better not taste like bacon bits! We ordered wings and asked for extra crispy. They came burnt, over cooked and floating in oil! Just not edible! The pizza crust is rubber and just strange tasting! The sauce is filled with sugar, and it was runny! Watery and not filled with goodness. Toppings were not fresh at all. The location is ify,when you walk in its dark and filled with sadness. It took 5 mins at the counter for someone to even say hi In closing I can not believe this place is still open let alone a chain that people keep pouring money into! Seriously though I had better pizza at a gas station for 2 bux! You should be ashamed of yourself~~#~0
Went there on Sunday-  New Years Day...  they were busy but not that busy-  It took 20 minutes for the food to come out the first time-  cold...then 15 more minutes the 2nd time...but they got my meal wrong...they re-made it the 3rd time and it was still wrong....  made it 4 times...it's been an hour and 10 minutes...I ate it;....but it was still wrong...  you'd think I ordered something special....  hamburger without maynoise protein style cooked medium...they couldn't get it right...every time came out beyond well done...  not sure how many time the manager said I'm sorry and finally the 4th time said...maybe we need to check the grill...you think????  I bet most people would deal with it and just not go back....  If I'm paying for something I want it right and the way I want it....   I get mistakes happen...but 4 times...  they need to get their $#&%*)&%@  together or they'll find everyone going to the other Red Robins where you get what you order.~~#~0
This places sucks and is completely overpriced.  I took my kids here last weekend because we live around the corner and their Facebook page says "Kids Eat Free on the Weekends!".  Sweet, I took the kids over and ordered our food.  My bill was $25.00.  I asked the cashier, who was half dead and could have cared less about us, why I was billed for the kids meals.  I physically pulled up their Facebook page on my phone and showed her what it said.  She told me "Sorry, we don't do that anymore.  My boss is just lazy and never removed it."Awesome!  Thanks for honoring what you have clearly written on your Facebook page!  Way to make good with your customers!  There was a line of people behind me and arguing with this corpse would have gotten me nowhere so I sucked it up and paid for the food.We got our food and it was less than impressive for price.  My kids each got the kids sliders and fries meal.  The burger patties are paper thin and resemble rubber.  I could have whipped them off the walls and they would have kept their shape.  They also had the smallest amount of ketchup and mustard I have ever seen on a burger.  My $10 Santa Fe' burger or w/e it was called had the same tasteless rubber pattie, and a bunch of toppings.  If it wasn't for the toppings, it would have been dry and gross.  The only thing that was decent were the fries and they were certainly nothing earth shattering.I have absolutely no idea why anyone thinks this place is awesome.  Aside of being lied too about kids eating free on the weekends, my burger was sub-par at best and the kids sliders were gross.  For the same price I could have made 20 of my own burgers which blow these things away, or I could have eaten a Zipps burger for less, which destroys anything these guys make.Seriously, save your money.  This place is way overrated.~~#~0
Its suitable when you are dying for quick cheap pizza. I have lived within a block of them ever since they opened, I have eaten there three times in like 8 years. I try them again about once every two years to see if they have improved. Here is the problem: it just doesn't taste that good. Owner and employees are nice, but the product is average. They need to use better cheese, and tastier sauce. The crust is also average, way too chewy/doughy. It's funny because if they just fixed their pizza they could really have a good thing - it's totally tucked away in this little corner by the fountain, outdoor seating is avail, in this tiny little strip mall with like zero competition for a two mile radius - local neighborhood people like me would totally get behind them, but the pizza is just not that good, sorry.~~#~0
This place has fallen off quickly. All the cool/competent employees have been run off. All the specials have been revised but with no warning so you get screwed if you assume anything. Food sucks. Service sucks. Stay away. Look for a new place in the next few weeks cause this place is DONE.~~#~0
Not a big fan. Chipotle and Baja fresh are a lot better.~~#~0
Vile megastripmall of the future. No wonder H&M wouldn't settle down here despite so many chicken sacrifices from cheapskates who would love an alternative for cheap officewear cut to fit actual human beings (suck it Target and Old Navy boxpeople). There's not much more that can be said about how poorly planned the parking and store layout is, all the other One Star Crew reviewers have nailed the relevant points. The biggest gripe I have about this place is that it is in an area where I need to shop. Driving out to other "outlying" Targets, Petsmarts, etc, is a pain in the ass so there I go to Tempe Marketplace again! Being such a typically lazy American consumer pigdog and resorting to the last resort fills me with the sort of self-loathing usually reserved for bikini season or high school yearbook viewings.~~#~0
Don't like this place very much.  The decor is really cheesy and tacky, the location is horrid, and the food is sub par at best.  I come from the nyc area, so i've had my fair share of authentic Italian food and this place could do much better.  I'm also not sure what's up with the Ferrari in the front of the restaurant.  WHY?!~~#~0
I will do anything or use any excuse not to go to this place. I hate dealing with all the people here and the staff. If I wanted to be judged, I would rather go to church.~~#~0
Rude, slow, unresponsive, and incompetent staff from the hostess to the server.  The service is about as bad as I have experienced anywhere.  It took us nearly an hour to get one enchilada each after being seated.  My wife bit into her chicken enchilada and was greeted by several chicken bones.  The rice was mush on one side of the plate and almost raw on the other.  The sauce for my Sonoran Enchilada was awful.  The only thing I can say positive is that the salsa was good and I eventually managed to get a refill on water before I left.  Still not enough to earn anything more than the minimal score possible.  This one goes on my no-go list.~~#~0
Terrible.  Burger patties tasted like they were microwaved.  Hot dog was rubber.  Never again will I go here.~~#~0
Bought the Brazillian blowout on Groupon.  It was advertised to make curly hair straight for 6 weeks minimum even after washing. It took almost 4 hours to do my hair. It also was supposed to include a cut. The cut was uneven and terrible. My hair was straight, but kind of fuzzy on the ends. My mom finished the ends later with a flat iron and it looked good. I waited 3 days to rinse, not wash it as I was told. It went all the way back to as curly as it was to begin with. Called Cathee and she said she had a better product and it would be in in a few weeks. This was June. Finally in Sept. got a new appointment. On my way to my 1:00 appt. she called me to ask where I was. She said she changed it to noon per my request. I had requested to change it but she left me a message saying no she wanted to leave it at 1. She repeated 1:00 at least 6 times in the message. She said she never said that and I had to miss my appointment because she scheduled another at 3 and would not have time for me. She also was short and rude with me. She called back later after I played her message back into her own message as she would not answer her phone. She then asked if I wanted to reschedule?? I had to take the day off of work twice and still have curly hair and am out $150. I will be requesting a refund from Groupon and start a dispute with my credit card company. She did not handle the professionally at all in my opinion and I will not be returning or recommending her to anyone.~~#~0
On the way to LA I stopped in on my layover.  I had a $12.95 plate of nachos with grilled chicken, which consisted of a large pile of nacho chips with a tablespoon of cheese and a tablespoon of chicken thrown on top.   What a ripoff.  The bartender was at least a nice guy who kept filling up my Diet Coke.On the way back from LA through Phoenix, I stopped in again as it was close to my gate.  I ordered a $6.95 bowl of chili - the bowl, not the cup - thinking they couldn't mess up chili.   When the bartender brought out the tiny little bowl, I was sure he'd made a mistake - surely that was the cup, not the bowl?  Alas, it was indeed the bowl.  The bartender, who I am pretty sure has grown tired of apologizing for the tiny bowls, didn't say a word.  But he did keep that Diet Coke cup filled very reliably.The chili wasn't bad, but it was way, way too small a portion to be priced as and called a bowl.    I walked out sloshing full of Diet Coke and still quite hungry.  On the way to the plane I bought $14 worth of yogurt and fruit, which I hungrily devoured.   I'd love to see the cup, at least if the cup is large enough to be seen with the naked eye.  Who's running this place, Ebenezer Scrooge?   I'll remember next time to steer wide of this place.~~#~0
Terrible first experience.  We were so fired up for this place, but dinner was a total letdown.1) One person's dinner showed up a half hour after everyone else's.  Inexcusable.2) No Pho.  "We ran out."  Whaaaaaaat?3) Overpriced.  Significantly.4) Out of way too many items on the food/drink menu.Positives: really cute place, great menu with lots of variety.  Some fine-tuning might be able to fix the problems.  Good luck, Rice Paper.~~#~0
Not reviewing the food or atmosphere, just the management at CPH:Went with a large group of 40 or so people - given the private room upstairs.  Due to what was apparently a miscommunication, CPH only wanted to allow our party to order from a set menu.  Many of us were not interested the set 4-course meal, and wanted food/drinks from the regular menu.  The management was not willing to allow this - since we didn't order from the fixed menu, they charged our group a $500 surcharge. So, CPH got $500 from our group (instead of the much larger fare had they allowed us to order from the normal menu.  But that will be the LAST penny CPH will ever see from me.  Saddle House, on the other hand, took great care of our large group at a moments notice.  We ate and had drinks there all night, including some freebies thrown in because they appreciated our business.~~#~0
Looks like a lot of people had the same horrible experience with this place that we did.We decided to try it one Sunday for a change of pace, hoping we'd find a great new breakfast option on the weekend.  What a huge disappointment.The menu offer too many options for the breakfast bowl.  Some people may like all these choices, but I personally would rather have an experienced Chef make the flavor choices for me at a restaurant.  We ordered some pancakes with eggs and a side of corn beef hash upon the recommendation of the cashier.  Unfortunately after ordering, we discovered that they didn't take credit cards and the cashier pointed me to an ATM.  I guess it's might fault for not looking on the door, but it's just almost a given in any modern food joints, with the exception, of say, the Mexican hot dog carts you see around town.  Anyway, that just rubbed us wrong and we scrambled to come up with the cash to pay.Enough has been already been said about the styrofoam plates.  The food was a disaster.  The hash was ICE COLD! It was like someone took it out of the freezer and barely put it on the grill.  Seeing as there was no server, I immediately took it back to the cashier.  He looked annoyed at our reasonable request, but agreed to have it remade.  When I got back to the table, I realized that one of my pancakes was burnt.  I mean black.  I don't know how the cook could have missed that they burnt their food like this before sending it out.  Either they don't know what they are doing or simply don't care.  I feel like it is more the latter.   If I wanted burnt pancakes, I'd have my dad come over to make them.  Overall the food is pretty flavorless and nothing worth making a trip out of your home for.  I think I've had better breakfasts at Jack in the Box.~~#~0
Absolutely horrible! If I could give this place half a star, or a negative star even, I would! The service was slow. The sushi was terrible. The Mr. and I came here during lunch, we had a total of 4 rolls (2 on their "happy hour lunch menu" and 2 regular specialty rolls). No drinks, only water. We ended up spending more during lunch here than we would have spent at Blu Sushi or Ah-So during dinner. We sat at the sushi bar so I could ask for my signature specialty roll which normaly costs about $9 at Blu and this place charged $13.95! It wasn't anything too extravagant nor hard to make - I could make these at home myself! When we questioned our waitress about our bill she said "oh sushi chef wanted $14, but I say no, $13.95!" WOW, a whopping 5 cents, thanks lady, I'll just take that extra 5 cents and buy me something pretty from the Old Navy across the street! Are you kidding me?!The price on the bill could have been worth it if the sushi was top-notch, but this sushi was bland, NOT fresh, the pieces were either tiny or falling apart. We had our friend over the other night for home-made sushi and when we compared sushi restaurants she raved about this place....seriously. Oh boy, we felt horrible for her. She obviously had never tried REAL, DELICIOUS sushi before! I'm better off making my own sushi at home then coming to this place! NEVER AGAIN!~~#~0
I hate to do this.  A Pho joint so close to home and yet so disappointing.  We've tried to give this place many chances and every time it's worse.  The Pho is just OK.  Anything else on the menu, especially if Thai-esque are abominations to Asian food lovers everywhere. The owners and their kids are sweet and I love Mom and Pop places but I just can't recommend this place.~~#~0
Many of the reviews of J. Alexander's have been quite descriptive so I'm going to keep mine short and to the point:I did not enjoy my experience here in the least.  Everything about this place is simply "typical."~~#~0
We were in Phoenix on business and went to Kincaid's for dinner. We have a gluten allergy and usually find steak and seafood places to have "safe" options for us. Our waiter was friendly and asked if we had any questions on the menu. We asked if they had a gluten free menu and he said no.  Then we asked about some of the menu items to see how they were prepared so we can determine if they were gluten free.  The waiter left and sent the manager over.The manager was very unhelpful and said everything on the menu had gluten in it. Even their mashed potatoes and all sauces and dressings.  Then we asked if we could get a grilled piece of fish with no sauce. He said all the fish was already prepared with the sauces and crusts on them. The only thing we could eat on the menu was the scallops...but they were out of scallops. He said there was a book in the kitchen of the ingredients for all of their dishes but the book was too big to look through. The table of 5 next to us were unhappy because the manager said he was too busy to split their check for them into two payments. We were so turned off by the lack of customer satisfaction that this manager demonstrated for us and for the table next to us.After going through this for 45 minutes, we left frustrated and hungry and drove 5 miles to Ruth's Chris where we had the most amazing dinner you can imagine. They had a gluten free menu, amazing service and the Chefs did not miss a beat on anything!I will never go to Kincaid's again. Terrible experience.~~#~0
CLOSED!!Not only closed, the whole store has been torn to the ground!!  :(~~#~0
I ordered oven roasted herb chicken. It comes as a half a chicken. Not as big as you'd think, especially for the price. Flavor was overpowered by  pepper and rosemary, the garlic mash had lumps of red potatoes surrounded by way too much sour cream.  The baked beans were more like a thick BBQ sauce that had a few beans in it.My Husband had the chicken tenders. They were dry and again over powered by the cornflakes they roll them in.  The cole slaw was decent. It's very dark, too dark for my taste. They must keep it that way so you can't see the beat up old furniture. If your a smoker you might not notice the overly pungent flavors.~~#~0
The first Drive up window is covered with a sunblock screen, I drove by it only to hear knocking from the back of my truck. So I pulled back to pay. Then they forgot straws. Then had to pull back because they gave my 2 year old frys instead of apples. Gila bend is punishment from above!~~#~0
This is the worst food ever.  White trash people you now have another gathering spot besides the greyhound bus terminals. Why eat here please tell me.~~#~0
Horrible food. Expensive. Bad service which is surprising since there's 100 servers milling around. Our order was simple - appetizer platter and side of fries. Fries came out with someone else's order which they tried to give us. They left the fries and 20 minutes later the rest of our order showed up. I hate this place which is too bad because I like the idea of it and the potential. But it always disappoints.~~#~0
If I could give this Walmart zero stars, I would. However, I have experienced rare sightings of helpful employees, so I'm writing a review less irritable that I have to give it a star at all.In my family, we refer to this Walmart as the "Cesspool". It is filthy, and the rare times I have to go to this store - usually when mum is doing something last minute at eleven p.m. - I end up going home and wanting to scrub with bleach.The first thing a customer notices is the parking lot. Littered with dirty diapers, vomit, and homeless people - not to mention rotting produce. This Walmart should take some action in cleaning it up, and making sure that all of their lamps are working - because this parking lot is sketch.You would think people cared more about their small children - on account that the crime rate in this area is so high. Nope. They let them run around like rabid animals, knocking things over, sitting in the middle of aisles, opening packages and then dropping them wherever they please. Employees do nothing about it.The only good experience I've had here, and it's the only reason I come back -  is when they were out of an item in the electronics area that I needed to set up my cable/television. An employee walked me over to where they should be, noticed they weren't there and spent twenty-thirty minutes looking through their new shipment to get them for me. Because I had been waiting so long, he opened up the register at the counter to let me check out, because I had only come in for the one thing.Otherwise, this place is disgusing.Bring hand-sanitizer.... You will need it.~~#~0
So, I wrote a review on this place a while back about how this place was unfriendly to tattooed people and wouldn't even let me get close to the front door and was pleased to see that I got a little apology from the owner. But when I read the actual comment she left, it was this "Thank you for taking the time to write this review. I apologize your level of service expectations were not met. It's our mission to please every customer with wonderful food, outstanding service, awesome entertainment and speedy service.Sincerely,Jessica (Marketing/ Event Coordinator) Cadillac Ranch Tempe"First of all Jessica, I didn't actually experience any service at your establishment, or even had a chance to have my expectations met or not. My experience wasn't the kind that you can go, "Sorry for the service"  And Thank you so much for cutting and pasting this generic apology on every bad review Cadillac ranch gets. (Didn't think we would notice that?) By you doing that, It honestly just showed me that you truly didn't care about making it right at all by actually reading what happened in my experience there and apologizing for it. Instead you picked all the reviews with one star and stuck the same apology over and over hoping that would be enough to appease the public. I would say I have never been so insulted in my life but if you actually take the two minutes out of your busy day to actually read my review this time. you will obviously see otherwise. Thank you "Jessica" and Cadillac ranch staff for once again showing your true colors when it comes to customer service by doing the bare minimum. Next time actually read the review.   -Thank you-~~#~0
No fresh ingredients at all. Mushrooms are obviously canned. How someone could rate a burger place high that doesn't do cook to order burgers is ridiculous. Might as well go to McDONALD'S.  Fries are terrible too~~#~0
Disappointing to say the least....This is my 4th time here and I wouldn;t have gone here so many times if it wasn't the proximity to MCC. Each and everytime I have been rather dissapointed with teh level of service which has been slow and blase at the best of times. This time around I had to wait 20 miniutes at teh sushi bar (after my order) before teh chef showed up. By then I had lost interest in suchi and Saketini as a whole. I would understand if this place was crowded but there were only 2 other groups and that too none of them were at the bar.Note to self: Never venture here again~~#~0
Yes Yasha does import great Russian food, however the horrible attitude you get from the owner makes you think twice about going to the store. If this was NY or LA he would be long out of business but due to the limited options in Phoenix he thinks he can get away with treating his long time customers like crap. Being Russian I have long come to understand the curt and non-friend behavior of other Russian's but Yasha is all together rude. He belittles and embarrasses his customers, and has his son participate in this behavior as well. If you want great Russian food with out all the b.s head down to the store on 12th street.~~#~0
Ghetto much?  If you like to wear a ton of hair gel and buy your dresses 5 sizes too small at Charlotte Russe then SWEEEEEEET this place is perfect for you.  The ONLY good thing is the music...the crowd just ruins it though.~~#~0
Called to make an appt for an oil change. They ALWAYS say they are fully booked for the day you request, even when you call weeks in advance! Ridiculous! Apathetic and always try to work against you, BEWARE this location!~~#~0
Goddamn this place sucks.After waiting a glorious 4.5  hours to get my stupid license, I walk away with my fabulous brand new ID valid until 2048...only to find my effing name is spelled wrong.I go back and tell genius that this is in fact NOT my name, and I need it fixed.  She referred me back to the line and said I'd have to pay $25 again.Yeah...NO.  So I spent the next 4 years with my name spelled incorrelty on my ID.  As you might imagine, buying/selling both a house and a car with incorrect titles led to tons o' fun with lawyers.Thank you, Tempe  MVD, for changing my name for me.  While I always thought "Katherine" was a long name, you added 2 more letters for good measure.On the other hand, I looked smokin' hot in my AZ DL picture and was devastated to find the Ohio DMV makes you surrender your old license when registering there. :(~~#~0
I absolutely love when employees are complete bitches. Ok, no, I lied. I hate it. As I was perusing a circular rack, one of their female employees decides to re-stack some clothes on my rack. Normally, I never mind that. But it became an issue when she would use all her super human strength to forcibly push all the clothes to give herself room, effectively shutting off all possibilities for me to see any of the clothes. Every time she did it, I very slightly, like 1/2 inch, tried to move the clothes so I can see the individual items, and it became a game for her where she would intentionally, with a smirk on her face, part the red sea of clothes for herself again and give me no chance. WTF? Completely unprofessional and rude. On top of that, I had like 20 items in my arms and she did not offer to take them from me to the fitting room, like BE employees usually (should) do. This same employee "assisted" me at the dressing room area...the whole time, she never said ONE word. Counted my clothes, gave me a number, shooed me in. But she was definitely vociferous with her male co-workers, who she flirted with while completely ignoring customers. I've had similar experiences here in the past. I will definitely go to the Missouri Ave location from now on because as these asshole people are proving, Tempe is the devil!P.S. also, you are selling USED clothes. USED. That means you shouldn't price them more than I can find them NEW. Douchebags.~~#~0
The drive through order taker was very rude, and interrupted me several times to ask questions she would have had answers to had she not interrupted me! Also, she asked me if there was "anything else" EVERY TIME I spoke. The experience at the window wasn't much better. I ordered ice cream as well as hot food, so my order took a little longer to process (which is to be expected). Instead of greeting me, taking my payment and giving me my drink I was left to sit for 5 minutes wondering if I should just drive away.In my past experiences this DQ has always been horrible, but today's interactions prompted me to post here as well as on their website.~~#~0
The panhandling is out of control at this location.While in the drive-thru, a bum, (or hobo, take your pick) will sneakily wait for you to roll down your window as you approach the speaker box. Then, before you can place your order, the asshole interrupts your well prepared sonnet about a number three and a diet coke asking for money. How fucked is that?This caused me to roll up my window, (like any good American) relying on my overly tinted windows to shield me from his view. Unfettered by my sly window moves, he simply refused to shoo. This caused me to roll down my window and bust-out my best Spanish where I warned him to move away from the vehicle. I even said it like a cop to scare him.Sadly however, the only thing I know how to say in Spanish is "Cuanto de su hermana?" or loosely translated, "How much for your sister?"It worked.He probably thought I had the crazy or something...who knows.Eight pieces of chicken will cost you ten bucks.It's pretty tasty stuff.PS. I also know how to say "Esta mota es mierda" (This weed is shit)~~#~0
I haven't removed my original 5-star review of Hanny's, replacing it with this 1-star, because I nabbed the first-to-review for it and don't feel like giving that up. But let me be absolutely clear: going to Hanny's is most definitely a 1-star experience, for reasons I will describe below. When I write a one-star review on Yelp, it means the following: I will not come here again unless I really have to (e.g., some pre-planned organizational event beyond my control). I will refuse to recommend anyone that I know to come here. I will refuse to suggest this as a venue for any event for any of the organizations I belong to. And I will tell everyone that I know, whenever it comes up, that Hanny's is a horrible place to spend any part of your evening. Seated at a large table with about 10 or 15 people one recent night, a friend and I ordered a beer each. Everyone else ordered various drinks and some snacks, and a pizza or two, as well. After 5 or 10 minutes, everyone else had gotten our drinks but the two of us. Though this is a bit annoying, it's nothing to write home about and not a big deal. Another 5 minutes later, the pizzas came out, which we weren't eating. But, still no beers. Another 5 minutes later (about 20 minutes after we'd ordered them), a third friend of ours who had noticed our beer-less selves got irritated on our behalf and decided to complain to our waiter. Yes, she did so in a somewhat stern manner. But she was not rude, and she did not speak with a raised voice. She was just to-the-point, and spoke in a manner that was commensurate with the unacceptably slow service we were being provided.A waiter who receives a complaint like this has a choice in how to respond. I dare say that the professional response, especially when (as is the case here) the customer actually IS right and the service actually HAS been unacceptably slow, is to say, "Ma'am, you're right, and I am so sorry. We've just been backed up and I will bring them out pronto." That would be the end of the story, right?Alternatively, you could stare back at the customer with a hostile look, and then defiantly declare with a rude and aggressive tone of voice, "Yeah, I'll get them, but as you can see we had a lot of food to bring out." Which is what happened. So, Excuse me? Our friend looked back and returned the favor, "I don't really care what your logistical problems are. I'm just pointing out that they don't have their drinks and they've been waiting for 20 minutes." The response: "Yeah, I heard you the first time." He then sulked off. That wasn't the end of it. Playing some sort of passive-aggressive game with the two of us, this waiter deliberately made us sit for an additional 5 or 10 minutes before finally bringing out our beers. He then refused to come back to our table again, even when new people joined our party and wanted to order a drink. (We wound up advising them to go directly to the bar to order, since we were being actively boycotted.) When he finally did bring us our drinks, I waited to see if an apology would accompany (keep in mind that the two of us had actually remained silent while all this was going on, since our other friend had decided to take on the service problem.) I was completely stunned to hear a wall of silence. I had done or said nothing to this man at all, other than politely order a glass of beer from him 25 minutes earlier. He could not muster up a simple, "Sorry about that, guys." Did I mention that this wasn't a busy night, so we were one of only a few groups they had to service at the time? As our table talked about what just happened, I learned that others have experienced this behavior from the staff in the past. And it actually has been to this level of deep and open hostility by waiters (I assume the same one). This doesn't shock me. There is no way a waiter or manager would become so emboldened to behave this way in front of customers he doesn't even know, unless it's part of a pattern. This wasn't just "having a bad night," which I let go all the time when I occasionally encounter it in restaurants. It was something deeper than that. Not only does the rudeness appall me, but so does the sheer incompetence of not realizing how widespread word-of-mouth can be when you attack a group of customers like us. How does this waiter know who we are? Maybe some of us are long-time residents of downtown Phoenix, who have lived there for years and know a lot of people? Maybe our voices, here on Yelp and among our very large social circles, are highly influential and can have a direct impact on a restaurant's revenues? Did he consider that before deciding to attack us? Nope.Karl Kopp, the owner of Hanny's, needs to have a serious talk with whoever is managing this restaurant. In the meantime, my opinion that I will loudly and frequently proclaim to everyone I know will remain unchanged, unless and until I receive a personal apology for this incident. I'm not holding my breath.~~#~0
Racist pharmacy employees. I was on vacation and needed a prescription filled for emergency dental surgery because I was in pain. I used the same insurance card I use at the Target Pharmacy on the East Coast. The employee did not recognize the card, denied there was coverage and asked if I was on some type of Government insurance because I was African American. The employee assumed I was on welfare. I am not.~~#~0
Food service, including room service, very bad as they consistently screw up our orders and food items not at all appetizing. Shuttle drivers are mean and not hospitable to all guests. Not a 5 star resort, as advertised.~~#~0
Wow, I am surprised at how far this place has gone downhill! I came in here the other night after not being in for a while, and for how dead they were (every time I go in here, the place is dead, so--how are they staying in business?), the service was inexcusably slow. Isn't this supposed to be "fast food"? The manager was unresponsive to my comment to that effect. There was also a cockroach just inside the front door, so maybe the health department should get involved. Also, just yesterday I hit Whole Foods' sushi bar, and for about the same price got a truly fresh product, so I won't be going back into Tokyo anytime soon.~~#~0
its hard to mess up a wendys burger, but this location seems to have figured out how to do it. Our food was luke warm at best. the french fries, tasted old, and where cold.  If you don't mind eating food that has been sitting under a hot lamp, this is the place for you, if you want hot food, you would be  better to leave it on your dashboard. as much as i hate to say it, try to avoid this location. I didn't even make a complaint, figured why waste my time.~~#~0
It was so so so bad:( Empanadas were hard as a rock and the filling tasted like bad Lipton soup, ugh.I got something else (maybe an ensaimada?) it was just so horrible I don't even remember.~~#~0
DO NOT USE THIS AIRLINES!!!! No amount of savings is worth the aggravation, lost time and elevate blood pressure this airlines and it's customer service causes. Absolutely a huge waste of time. I will do everything I can to stay away from this airlines and any business it is affiliated with. I will tell EVERYONE I know about the horrible disservice. I will make it a point to discourage anyone from flying with this company or it's affiliates.~~#~0
Woah, UBER FAIL.FULL DISCLOSURE:  I was contacted by Salty management in response to my less than favorable review of their Old Town location.  I was offered a gift card as an "I'm sorry, try us again" ploy in exchange for more detailed information on my shitty experience.  Ok, sure, I like free stuff, send it.  Plus, it sounded like they were making changes and attempting to improve things there, so I didn't mind giving it another shot.  FOUR months later, I receive the $50 gift card.  Right away I was disappointed that the gift card was supposedly only good at the North Scottsdale location, 32miles each way from my house.  Whatever, 3 gallons of gas round-trip (approx $6.00), why not.First things first (and I like to start on a good note before the bloodshed) their wait-staff is fairly attractive, nice sort of emo-slut look... easy on the eyes.  Our waitress was pretty cute, friendly, bra exposed... nice.  Their $8.50 "Monthly Special Margarita" was actually very tasty and poured very well.  Not too sweet and very strong.  If this was the only place in town to get a good margarita, that would be one thing.... but it's not.Now let it rain blood.The lighting in this place was the first fail of the night... we had to move from our first booth because we both felt we were sitting under a spotlight.  Our second booth (a round one) was a little better since we weren't under a spotlight, but the lighting cast a shadow on our table (shadow caused by my body) so that I had to move my body to the right and hold the menu to the left of me to read anything.  So annoying.  FAIL.We ordered their $1.95 Unlimited Chips and Salsa.  The chips were soaked in oil and the bottom 3/4 of the basket was un-edible because they were crumbs!  Wait, did a "Mexican" place just charge me $1.95 for shitty chips and "ok" salsa?  Yup, they did.  FAIL.I ordered the Fajitas, half steak half chicken with corn tortillas.  The Fajitas were made in this tomato sauce, which at first I wasn't too thrilled about, but in all honesty, I'm super glad they did because if it wasn't for the tomato sauce, the dish would have had 0 taste.  The meats had no seasoning on them and tasted completely bland.  I actually considered using salt (I NEVER use salt, even at home, unless it's popcorn) to give it some amount of taste.  Thank god for the tomato sauce.  The corn tortillas can only be described as disgusting.  I was only given three tiny corn tortillas but only ate two of them.  I can't really describe what's wrong with them, but they are foul.  The Fajitas came with a plate of cheese, rice, sour cream, and shredded romaine lettuce (yeah).  The only thing on the accompanied plate I ate was the rice and it was COLD!  Not warm, not luke warm, COLD!  My dining partner's rice was cold also.  WTF?  Needless to say, the cold rice was the best part of the meal, seriously.  F A I L.My dining partner ordered this Chipotle Chicken Burrito which, believe it or not, lacked taste and was bland.  Yes, BLAND!!!  How is it possible that a burrito covered in cheese, injected with a Chipotle sauce is bland?  No clue, but these clowns pulled it off.  Unbelievable.  F A I L.Our bill came, $45.32.. I figured, "great, $50 on the gift card, $5 out of pocket, she gets a $10 tip, and I never have to think about this place again".  Wrong.  They wouldn't let us put the tip on the gift card, so I ended up with $5 left on the card and had to pay $10 out of pocket.  So $10 out of pocket + $6 to get there, I paid $16 bucks and 2 hours of my life to eat an incredibly SHITTY meal.  In retrospect I wish they never sent me the gift card and I had stayed home and ate left overs instead, spending the $16 on a bottle of Vodka and a can of Soda Water.  I don't even really understand, their food got WORSE!!!  Why would you send gift cards, encourage people to try your place again and actually make your food worse?  Am I in bizzaro world here?  Aren't you supposed to IMPROVE the food?  "Mexican" food is the easiest food in the world to make "decent", hell even [fill in blank]-abertos is better, Macayo's, Serrano's, El Torrito, you name it, it's better (even the Clarendon's now defunct Mexican spot was better).  I have to figure the ONLY reason people come here is for the patio and to drink.  But still... there are plenty of places to drink, why support such a lousy place?  Perhaps they rely on their patrons to either be drunk when they eat so they don't notice, or so drunk afterward they forget.  U B E R   F A I L ! !~~#~0
So after reading all these reviews I thought to take a chance so I went to explore.  I arrived for lunch at 11am and was seated immediately.  The atmosphere was ok, and the bar looked a bit disorganized.  I ordered the the sesame chicken and egg drop soup.  I asked if I could pay extra for shrimp fried rice but was told no.  I chose the fried rice vs white or brown.  Soup came out first which I found to be very bland and very few pieces of egg in it.  On my 4th spoonful my meal arrived and I was not impressed by the way it looked.  The sesame chicken was only bits of fried chicken in batter covered with very little brown very thick and gooey sweet sauce.  Some of the chicken pieces didn't even have sauce on it and grossed me out because it was hard and bland.  The fried rice looked like it was done in a hurry with many white spots in it and with little taste.  The egg role wasn't bad although they did not serve with hot mustard sauce.  I will not be returning to this place.~~#~0
I took my son in for a cut here because I wanted to try them out and use one of the coupons they left at Kidspark. The stylist did not bother to wash his hair like the coupon stated was part of the service. Then, she cut his hair way shorter on the sides than I asked for with the clippers and scissor cut the top of his hair too short despite my reminder to not trim too much length because of his cowlick. Now, some of the hair close to the cowlick sticks up if I don't smooth it down with gel. To top it all off, the bangs she trimmed were not even across his forehead, but cut at an angle. Uggh. Perhaps I should have taken a picture for reference? :-( At least I didn't pay the regular haircut price for my kiddo's hair shearing.~~#~0
As an undergrad exploring my options for some sort of postgrad/medical school options I walked in and looked around. Looked at some information/ pamphlets and talked to a receptionist. Everything that would warrant a 4 star review, so what could possibly have gone wrong for them to receive such a poor review. The spam mail. This place will clog your mailbox/inbox/any other medium of communication they can find just to send you the same information over and over and over again. I realize that you can easily remove yourself from an e-mail list, but the sheer amount of useless crap that they send to you is grounds alone for a 1 star review. Not only is this annoying and a  huge waste of time/paper & ink, but it just reeks of desperation. P.S. after reading the above review, (clearly from somebody who works there) in my opinion, $20,000 per year for a "degree" in something most of the world considers a joke is tantamount to education fraud. If you have the estimated $200,000 for 4 years of "education" to throw away be my guest, and if not just avoid giving them ANY of your contact information.~~#~0

Is there less than a star rating?Met a group of 10 people at this restaurant for a friend's birthday.  First impressions were good.  It is a lovely old-world mission style building with a warm glowing Himalayan salt wall to illuminate the dining area.  Sounds amazing.  I was sold at first site.  Service seemed accommodating and eager.  The server kept asking if we wanted shots and we all declined, it was way too early to get the birthday girl that intoxicated before dinner, right?  Food was nicely displayed, minimal portions but filling and tasty.  The server asked if we wanted dessert.  We declined.  It was time to finish our wine and think about our next destination while enjoying each others company.   Suddenly, three to four dessert plates are delivered to our table.  Hhhmm, who ordered this?  It was a big table, I assumed someone wanted to share the full course dining experience.  I didn't think to inquire further.  The server again, asks if we want to do shots.  yea, no dude.  Stop with the shots.  Not interested.  A few minutes later a tray of shots shows up....Weird!  Nobody seemed interested the last few times our server asked.  But here they are so bottoms upThe bills arrives approximately $800.  Tips included.  Wow.  Okay, we split it.  We continue to consume our drinks and talk.  Minutes later, the manager ( I assume since we hadn't been graced with his presence prior to this event)  comes to our table to encourage us to leave as the restaurant is filling and they need the table.  Really?  Are you Eff-ing kidding me.  We just dropped almost a grand and have been served a full course meal and you want us to wrap it up.  Outside we are discussing this last event and our dining experience... come to find out, no one in our party ever ordered the desserts or shots!!!  Holy server manipulating and pocket padding scandal!!!What did I expect?  Ventured into Scottsdale. The land of taking advantage.~~#~0
I'll admit they have good yogurt--nothing special though. A little worse than yogurtland and but a lot better than cherry on top and orange leaf. However, their management is THE WORST. Teens who work are unfriendly and, quite frankly, rude. They give you the smallest sample, don't look at you when you ask/ when they hand it to you and are always in your way with the toppings. How about cleaning WHEN THERE ISN'T A HUGE LINE. This isn't the real problem though. Today, I went in to take advantage of the 35 cent Tuesday deal. I go to ring up and it comes to $2.65. I have a $3 credit so I ask if I can fill up more. The girl says ok so I quickly top it off. When I get back, the total is now $7!!! My mom paid and didn't realize the big difference. And why not tell me I can't use my credit on the promotional day when I ask?? Shouldn't she tell me I can't use the 3 off on Tuesday??So I asked my mom how much it costs and she tells me $7! I knew it could NOT be that much so I go back in and ask them to reweigh it. Sure enough it was supposed to be $4. They rudely need to "confirm" with the register while we wait in the way of all the other customers. They barely say sorry and try to blame it on the scale or suggest someone had their hand on it. If you're paying by the ounce, I'm pretty sure no one would put their hand on the scale...At any other place, they wouldn't charge you for the yogurt and you'd probably get it for free. But at this establishment, they are so stingy and rude. I've been a part of a fundraiser with them also and they refused to let me advertise outside. You only get 20% of sales if the customer says they're for the fundraiser. They wouldn't let me tell any of the customers walking in. SUCH BS.Go to any yogurt place. Yogurtology is expensive, rude, and stingy with their samples and service.~~#~0
We stopping in on Saturday Sept 1 at about 2:PM the sign said they closed in the afternoon and reopened for dinner a couple of hours later. Since we were there about 15 minutes before the closing time and just wanted a sandwich we went in. There were about 4 employees at the counter working on prep for dinner and about three other customers. No one greeted us but they had to have seen us you just can't miss someone standing at the front door. Eventually we just sat outselves. Still no one would make eye contact or approach us. My partner went to the counter and got a menu and the woman at the counter said she didn't see us. She would have to be blind not to have seen us. We ordered a sandwich from the self service counter. It was not impressive just meat and cheese on bread with lettuce. The potato salad was nice but a pretty small portion for the price. We definetly felt unwanted. If you want to strart prepping for dinner at 1:30 then close at 1:30.~~#~0
Staff is nice, but they don't really care to talk much.. It's not like it was busy (i was the only one there). Anyways fries were made from the frozen/freezer bag kind. it was all mushy inside.I could make a better burger at home on a george foreman. I will pass on this place...they have the most unhealthiest menu ever too.. if you go twice in a lifetime you most likely will have at least 1 heart attack.kudos on that part...~~#~0
I have to say i'm quite saddened that i had to choose 1 star; as i was so looking forward to finding a new fav along Camelback rd. my sister and i headed to Rosie Mc Caffreys (sp), but turned off at SunUp Brewing Co. by default; we had to stop in because we were both starved and the menu offered Corned Beef and cabbage, plus we still had about 6 streets to go. we stepped inside to a "please wait to be seated" sign, so we waited, and waited (as several wait staff passed and looked our way without even a nod of acknowledgement) for about 5 minutes. finally our server approached us and offered inside or patio (we chose patio of course!) she was very nice at first seating and asked for our drink order. since neither of us partake in the appreciation for micro brews, we chose raspberry ciders. we were happy. the crowd was sparse-but present. the weather was fabulous. it was a weird set-up with 3 small rooms (patio in between both) and no room to turn around. there was no reason our server should have been perturbed; other than having to maneuver around tables inside, as she hardly had tables. none the less, when she returned with our beers, she plopped them down hard on the table and stormed off. the beers were served lukewarm but we tried to drink them anyways. she returned a few minutes later for our order. since it was a toss up between the Corned beef and cabbage & the Fish n chips, i asked the servers opinion, inquiring if the corned beef was sliced thin, of to which she replied "it isn't sliced thin"-but it was sliced thinner than a nickel, plus the meal wasn't even served with bread or butter; but back to the ordering....after she took our order, i asked her for 2 cold pint glasses; since the beers were warm (only the bottle was slightly cold). she brought back glasses with ice and straws, pounced them on the rod iron table and went on to tell me why micro brews aren't served in cold pint glasses, saying she didn't have any chilled pint glasses because this is a micro brewery. it wasn't until after her lecture on the creation of beer, that i explained that even if there is a right way to serve-some people do request chilled pints. i explained that i wasn't a beer afficionado, i just wanted to drink my beer the way it should be served "chilled" she gave me attitude, walked away and then returned with two cold pint glasses, pouncing them on the table as she uttered "here these are for our Root Beer" while she turned on her heels to run. the rest of the meal was pleasant, as she was hardly available. the only time i seen any of the female servers was when an assumingly wealthy man was spotted, that was when most of the servers would approach and hug them (much to close by restaurant standards) very tightly. however most tables around us were either taken by lesbians or hetero females so the ladies weren't hoovering around us too much.  we received the credit card bill to sign, which was also plopped off mid walkaway. the tables are patio tables with holes, so most people with common sense would prepare for the signing of the bill with a hard bottom of some sort, but not here! they are all consumed with the spotting of rich men and instructions for micro brewing that they don't have time to serve or be of assistance, so be prepared to either pay them upfront to be treated like a patron, or flash your directors card because they seem to think this is suddenly Scottsdale. on to the food. i tasted my sisters fish and chips and the homemade chips were soggy from the fish. the halibut was delicious although sister had to pull off all the breading, because it was as thick as an Indian popover. they did serve it with spicy ketchup which was surprisingly delicious. my corned beef cabbage was served paper thin, without bread or butter; but it was still very tasty. the red potatoes soft and the carrots & cabbage blanched to perfection. next time i'll just try sitting at the bar.~~#~0
It had been a year since our last visit to Old Spaghetti Factory.  What a difference a year makes!  My dinner was not too impressive.  Actually no one in our party of four was thrilled with their meal.  Very small portions and the food seemed like it was not even cooked fresh.Don't think that we will be back any time soon.  I am pretty sad about that, as I have fond memories of OSF.~~#~0
Here's the bad news: Maybe it's just me, but I don't like walking across peanut shells to get to my table. I guess some people think it's fun to throw shells on the floor. The environment is otherwise just fine and the menu has plenty to offer. My husband got a burger and I got the grilled meatloaf with a salad and mac n' cheese as a side. The hamburger tasted of bread filler and the meatloaf was like someone had spilled a bottle of onion powder into the mix. OH - I almost forgot. The water is undrinkable and tastes terrible. The server said they get a lot of comments on that and that they filter it but I wondered with what. They gave me a soft drink instead, but even that had the unfiltered water mixed in with it. Here's the good news: they serve excellent warm rolls while you're waiting for your food. I could have eaten just these. They have plenty of beer for people who like that, and since the water is awful, bottled beer might be a good bet.~~#~0
no good vibes whatsoever.  The food was below average and the service lackluster.  The highlight of the evening was when a drunk patron picked a fight with us and when we asked to bartender to intervene he informed us that "he wasn't paid enough to babysit'.  Do yourself a favour and stay away.~~#~0
Eww...if I could've given less than half a star, that would be my rating. This place was gross. The decor was so modern and cold it felt more uncomfortable than a doctors office. Maybe I don't understand improvisational, it was not what I expected. I expected to write foods I  like and don't like, and the chef would prepare a special meal based on my interests. Instead, the menu is a list of 8 or so meats (kangaroo, wild boar bacon, foie gras, frog legs, etc) you cross off won't you won't eat, then the chef will give you one of the ones you did not cross off. It was all tasting size portions, and to be honest I'm glad they were just that.  If you got the kangaroo, another table who didn't cross it off got the same exact kangaroo.I would've been much happier going to McDonalds. Yuck!~~#~0
Why do people go to Hooters? I've never seen a girl with a decent rack there yet. You would think that would be a requirement of employment given the name of the place, but apparently it isn't. The peanut oil wings make me ill.If you want to have young hot chicks dressed like tarts serve you greasy bar food then head downstairs to the Library or go to The Tilted Kilt (which actually has pretty decent food).~~#~0
First off, I will NEVER patron Roy's in Chandler ever again!! Please read on to see why...A friend and I went for Aloha hour and it was awesome. Everything on the HH menu is only $5!   We enjoyed everything from the food, drinks, & service, that we decided to come back and try their dinner menu.9/4/2010My friends tried the Hibachi Style Grilled Salmon, they both were quite pleased. Perfect portion size, above average quality but yet still a bit pricey. Nonetheless, the dish was quite satisfying. For my meal I had the Hawaiian Style Misoyaki Butterfish.  It came with black "forbidden" rice and bok choy.  Each flaky bite was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  Excellent choice!This is where it gets ugly...As our average service was about to conclude, the waiter drops our check off. I ask him for another cup of coffee and as he pulls his hand back from delivering the check, he knocks a quarter glass of wine all over my friend and her phone. He proceeds to apologize and cleans a portion of it up, then walks away. He never returns for the coffee I asked for, nor did he offer to refill my friend's $8 glass of wine. I gave him time to reconcile as I saw him pace back and forth but to no avail. I had to chase him down for my refill on coffee. Despite my friend getting wine spilled over her without compensation, our party decided to reflect our displeasure through our tip (~8%) opposed to an open, verbal complaint. However, our waiter wasn't pleased with his gratuity. He came back to the table after he discovered his low tip. YES! He actually had the nerve to return to our table as if he didn't understand why he received a low tip! He spilled wine, which we had paid for, on the customer without compensating for it! What did he expect?? He came back to the table asking if we were displeased with his service. Astonished by his ignorance, we explained to him what we were displeased with. Get this... He didn't think spilling the wine over my friend wasn't a big deal because he thought it was a small amount and that she was finished anyway. Imagine a waiter spilling a paid for glass of wine over you and justifying it because you were almost done anyway. Absolutely ridiculous! Plus, what did he expect from us at that point. Did he expect that we would change our minds and tip him more? The waiter apologized once more and we just got up and left.Our server, THOMAS  the absolute most ungrateful, inappropriate & rude bastard of a server I've ever encountered!! The manager was of no assistance either. Just a note, in the Service Industry, there is no verbal apology that is acceptable. In the Service Industry, the only apology comes in the form of compensation. The manager apologized but asked if we would like to have gift certificates. That's like saying "May I say 'Sorry' to you?" He should've given, not asked to give. Putting the onus on the customer is an insult. We declined since acceptance would paint us as opportunists.Bottom line you expect above the standard level of service when you're shelling out $25-40 per entree.  So even though the food was great, the horrible experience with how we were treated is cause enough to never return to this location.  It's like being slapped in the face but saying it's okay because the food was wonderful...NO THANK YOU!!~~#~0
If I could choose a zero or negative number of stars I would.  I've been a Hilton hotel whore over the last 2-3 years of my career.  For the most part they are predictable.  The service and amenities are fine.  Mostly no complaints.  I stayed at one just a week ago.  Usually they are very accomodating.  14 hours ago my business plans changed and I had to fly into Phoenix tonight instead of in the morning because my meeting got pushed to an earlier time.  hilton.com has never failed me.  Tonight they did.  At 12:20 am I rolled into my hotel.  The guy at the desk was nice enough but informed me they were overbooked and I had to go down the street to doubletree.  Fine.  I'm tired.  It's late.  I don't have the will to fight or even think.  He handed me a letter and I walked out looking at the other guests in the lobby with envy because they didn't have to get into their car's and drive to another hotel and start over.  All I wanted was to go to bed, but I'm pissed off.When I opened my car door it started to hit me.  Yes....I was only going to drive 1.5 miles according to my GPS, but it's almost 1 am and this is an enormous pain in the ass.  I explained that to the guy at the desk at doubletree which he was generically apologetic.  I also mentioned that maybe they shouldn't confirm a reservation if they were overbooked.  How about giving me a heads up?  It's not like I haven't rolled into a hilton after midnight before.  Before I reached the entry of the doubletree I decided they better make it right or I don't have to do business with them anymore.  Sure enough....there was no free room upgrade or valet service.  My consoIation prize was a warm chocolate walnut cookie and a broken smile.  Again....I'll take it up in the morning with the manager.  "They haven't heard the last of me".  I don't want to do this either, but jesus!  This is unacceptable.~~#~0
Okay we went in a group of eight at noon, so the place is packed with people and busy, we expected that. took us about 10 min to place order which was fine; rush hour. I Ordered white widow, blunt with guacamole sauce came to about 11$The fun part started, waiting for our sub, after about 15 min first sub delivered to one of the guys in the group, another 5 min and everyone in the group got their sub but me so I decided to play it cool and be nice and give them some more time.About half a dozen of people got their subs and I still didn't get mine I asked for my sub and mentioned that I've been waiting for a while, the answer was oh what's your name oh ok yours is coming out in a second, a minute passed and didn't see my sandwich at this time i started getting upset asked again for my sandwich but no one seemed to have a clue about it and the person who seemed in charge looked for my order and said oh yea its coming, 5 min passed and another half a dozen of people went by and I still didn't get my sub. By now about 30 min have passed and more and more people got their food and I'm standing their watching. Went back to the staff and asked for my money back. I don't care how good the food looked like or how many people say its taste good, with this rudeness and carelessness this store is worthless. Btw One of the guys in my group got the wrong sandwich.I might give this store another try if they tried to make it up to me. Would I do it again with a group or a recommend to friend. No.  Don't embarrass yourself and go their. I'll let you know if they proven me wrong and contact me through Yulp and show that they do care.05/15 I guess they really don't care about their customers~~#~0
We knew before we even left the house that we were going to be disappointed with our meal wherever we chose.  For some reason good restaurants on this side of town are damn near impossible to find.  I was feeling like having a Mexican breakfast and although I had heard bad things about this place I decided to give it a try anyways because it was on our route.Unfortunately, they dont serve breakfast other than a buffet.  The wife got chicken taquitos and I did the brunch buffet.  The horchata was excellent.  The salsa was ok and thats about where it ended.  The brunch was 15.95 and definitely not even worth half of that.  The eggs were bla.  The fruit wasn't ripe.  The bacon was undercooked.  The sausage was overcooked.  And I completely missed the omelet station.  The wife couldnt eat more than two of her taquitos they were so bad.  The manager then came by and opened the patio doors even though we had a 3 month baby right by them and it was a pretty cold morning.  Considerate.The comment that summed it all up was when my wife said "For all the money the  spent on this building and decor they should have spent some in the kitchen on a real chef and better ingredients."  I told her well at least I have something to yelp about.I'm not sure why its so hard to put a good restaurant on this side of town but if someone did it would probably be a gold mine.~~#~0
No way Jose...... Desperate times calls for desperate measures. So find a safe place to park the car and sleep in it. Because this is not where you want to be. We actually had gasoline siphoned out of the moving truck we were using.  Go figure. :)Bottom-line....it is need a major renovation......~~#~0
I bought a tdi Jetta from Berge and the black one we originally bought was delivered with multiple cosmetic dings dents, and swirls in the paint. I will presume it came from the buffing machine, but it was so noticeable that after multiple hmm's and haww's their response was there is no such thing as a perfect black car. We walked away from the deal, but we were threatened with their legal department and later settled on a white Jetta. Next, we have ran into multiple service issues, which Berge continually using the excuse they need to check with VW warranty approvals, but will not offer rental cars and let you sit for hours in the waiting room until you get so frustrated you demand your vehicle back or you can pay for the repairs and they will reimburse you later. Today, is a prime example. I am in for an oil change and some other service related items. We were promised a loaner vehicle and they needed just about a 1/2 hour to conduct diagnosis. It's been 4+ hours now, they've been almost done for 3 hours and if we hear the transmission clunking around, smell the odor coming from the vents, or the car stalls, bring it back in, but as far as today the car checks out perfectly. LOL!!!  We are just waiting for our car back to take it to a different dealer. VW is a great car, just the service department in my case is horrible! Drive the distance to a different service department. Trust me on this one!~~#~0
Another place I'd like to give a negative star review.For starters, the lanes have entirely too much oil. I mean like, my ball towel was saturated before the night was over, and I didn't even play 3 entire games.We were there sure a fundraiser, and entry was to include a pizza, and a pitcher of soda.Realizing most of the other bowlers had already received, and consumed their pies, I inquired as to the location of ours, only to be informed that it had already been brought. Funny, nobody told me, or my hungry children.The manager seemed quite displeased to be asked to provide us the pizza we were owed, and finally, begrudgingly, brought three measly slices. I asked if that was all we got, and he said "All the pizza have been brought out"Dude, we DIDN'T GET OURS!Whatever, they were just barely doing what they had to.I would never voluntarily return there on my own, but I would probably go back if I was invited there.For the record, I prefer Brunswick lanes over AMF, and I prefer small establishments, rather than large corporate ventures.~~#~0
I have just left Cafe Essence from one of the worst experiences at a restaurant.  After waiting nearly an hour in the crowded, noisy and small dining area where people mill about like vultures for your table.  My food arrived.  As a vegetarian a giant lump of sausage was not appetizing.  My husband spoke to the manager who handed him the plate of food that was correct.  At that point I requested a simple bowl of granola as the previous plate was highly unappetizing.  The manager refused and kept pushing the plate at my husband.  She was incredibly rude asserting that I should just take the plate and that I had no right to change my order to something $3 cheaper just because *gasp* it was meat!  I don't wantto get into a philosophical debate as it's not a persons place to judge my choices, especially someone I am paying to make my food.  But she had no right to make those assumptions.  So thank you Cafe Essence for judging me, refusing to make it right and still providing horrific service despite this mess.  This review would have still been poor despite your lack of caring for your customer.  I have been able to send food back at Denny's with no questions asked.  But Cafe Essence is so high on it's horse that even with their own mistakes they'll still argue that YOU are in the wrong.  Their food is not good enough to be put down and degraded in front of other customers.  Take your business elsewhere.~~#~0
Not sure why it say's closed. I was just there 2 days ago. Dirty, grimy, poor service.. Over priced semi-fresh food. (I guess, fresh is 'relative')~~#~0
With the new low prices comes cheaper ingredients. The flavor is NASTY! When I asked for my money back, they gave me attitude from someone named Parland~~#~0
Place closed~~#~0
hours posted are wrong. arrived here at 4:45 today, opened door and was greeted by a woman telling me they didn't open until 5:30. well as of now posted hours here are from 4. I get that hours change and not all media gets updated, but their doors were open and their hours reported as such. No offer to be seated and offered a drink anyway or even an incentive to return during new business hours. just a simple we are closed until 5:30 and an escort out.  I repeat, hours posted on this site as of writing this review reflect my attempted patronage. lock your door or update online info or be courteous. there were only 2 of us, and not even a question if there would be more which there wasn't. never been here before. probably will not try again thanks to this experience~~#~0
I hate Zuma! They are always crazy crowded!  the space is so awkwardly shaped moving around or getting to the bar is nuts.  This past weekend  the line for the ladies' room was horrendous because they only had one working stall. Boo!~~#~0
In short, slow service, average food and a poor attitude by the wait staff add up to a disappointing meal.[BTY - Yelp maps this place 6+ miles from where it actually is located.]~~#~0
Definitely not one of the better Bliss locations.  Rude staff, tiny lounge, there was no shampoo, no mouthwash, no lotion ....the steam room didn't work. When I asked staff why there was no product she said "You need to pump really hard".  I said "I did pump -very hard".  SHe said "oh well we're working on replacing those pumps".  The excuse for the steam room not working, according to the staff member was that "sometimes it gets over heated".  My massage was mediocre at best.  If you're going to visit a spa in Arizona, visit Sanctuary or Royal Palms.  Bliss Spa is only worth visiting in LA, London or NYC.~~#~0
Came here to try something new. Maybe we should have stuck to our favorites. The water they serve here tastes like it came out of a garden hose, no amount of lemon could save it. After ordering drinks, we waiting what seemed to be a lifetime for the waitress to come back to ask questions about the menu and order. My bf ordered the shrimps tacos but got fish tacos. He ate what he continued to eat them because the waitress never came back to check on the food. He thought they were the worst tacos he had ever had. He did not finish them. Something had got to be pretty bad for him to leave food on his plate. The only time I would ever come back here would be for happy hour but even then probably not.~~#~0
I HATE this place, but I seem to be stuck going back to it. They book alot of great bands and the show line-ups are usually really good. The positive ends there. Staff is rude, its hot as hell, there's not place to sit if you're under 21, and once you're in, you're in. Zero reason for re-entry.The last show I went to was to support some friends and I had a 13 year old with me. I stayed in the under 21 area with him. About 2 hours into the show, my arthritis in my knee started acting up so I found a spot on the floor where I could sit and relax for a few moments. I made sure I was away from everyone and in a well lit area so nobody would trip over me. I wasn't on the floor for two seconds before there was a flashlight blaring in my face and security yelling at me to get off the floor. I held my hand out to him and yelled back (so he could hear over the music) that I had a bad knee and I needed help getting up. He continued to yell "get the hell up!" while I struggled to me feet. I limped out (luckily, the band I was with got me back in to see their set) but I was livid all night. I asked a few other people if there was a place to sit and explained and pleaded that I was in pain and I got the cold shoulder time and time again.Audience was jumping on stage during the main band and security didn't do anything about it. So basically when you go to this place, feel free to attempt to ruin the show, but whatever you do don't sit down.It's always dirty and, bluntly, the place stinks. It's a mix of B-O and human waste (since they never clean the bathrooms) that will burn the hair right out of your nose.My advise-aviod this place at all costs. If your favorite band is playing 1 show in Phoenix and its here, catch them in the next town. The gas money is well worth it!!~~#~0
Unfortunately I have to downgrade my rating of this restaurant after today's events.I'll preface this review with the recognition that The Melting Pot recommends reservations. However, of the many many times we've visited this location, we've never had a problem getting right in without a reservation owing to the fact that we go at off-times. So we have a long history of going without a reservation, and have always been seated--maybe with a 30 min wait at most, but usually right away.My wife and I walked in at 4:00pm on Sunday (our 12th wedding anniversary) and the parking lot was nearly empty. The hostess gave us the usual "Can I help you?" which I have always found odd, as if there is some other reason I would be there than to eat. We said we didn't have a reservation and she immediately told us we couldn't be accommodated. Apparently they had sold a "living social" and thus the restaurant was just impossibly booked.This was (almost) comical because the place was deader than disco--not even a single human voice could be heard. I happen to know what Living Social is, but what if I didn't? Why is that my concern, and why is that being given as a reason for not seating me? Not "we're all booked up", which I can understand, but apparently they were saving empty tables in case people decide to come in and redeem their Living Social coupons. Shame on me, I guess, for not getting a coupon.To be clear, I have absolutely no problem with being turned away at a restaurant that recommends reservations. That's my fault for ignoring the recommendation. I do have a problem with being turned away at a half-empty restaurant because they did a Living Social deal and thus they can't accommodate me just in case these hypothetical coupon-holders come in the door. If that's how you want to run your business, fine, but don't make it the customer's problem.I've spent thousands here and won't be going back ever again. So, I hope your "Living Social" was worth screwing over your long-term customers.~~#~0
I use to love taking guests/clients/co-workers in town to the Rusty....but when Psychobilly band plays,  I have be careful who I take...   Jimmy and his raunchy lyrics...get kind of old after a while.  And he yells ever 5 minutes to TIP the F**king band...that gets old too!   Handle Bar J's is larger not as quiant as R.S.  but classier I guess.   Bring back the other band!~~#~0
The staff bring and eat their own food in the dining area...~~#~0
I just moved here about a month ago and everyone said "You have to get an In-N-Out burger".  I was really digging "Whataburger" but I decided to try this place out.  I should have just stayed away.  I had to wait in the drive through for about 15 minutes and my double burger was tiny, cold and raw in the middle.  Not pink or slightly under cooked but raw with an odd char on the outside.  The fries were half burnt and reminded me of "Potato Sticks" from when I was a kid, but not nearly as good.  I let my dog have some of it because it was so gross and it made him sick for 2 days.I'll just stick with "Whataburger" or even McDonald's. I have no idea why this place would ever get a 5 Star review.~~#~0
Dropped in on Saturday night and was immediately seated without reservations.  Sat at table for 15 minutes with NO acknowledgment from server.  Meanwhile other tables got drink and menu orders taken.  Got up and left.  Won't be back.~~#~0
We had never been to a Wienerschnitzel before, and after this dinning experience we will probably not be coming back.We were going to Bookmans and thought this might be a good quick stop for something other then tacos and burgers.  Watching some of the LA Angels baseball games on TV this past summer made me think of Wienerschnitzel and their 50 year celebration.  After eating here, I cannot imagine how they lasted that long.  The only other hot dog chain which I have eaten is Nathan's Famous.  Even though Nathan's has it's own short comings, they at least have a product you might actually want to eat, other than at 2 o'clock in the morning.This is a hot dog place, plain and simple. They serve Oscar Meyer type hot dogs, though that might be a disservice to Oscar Meyer.  There is something about their Original hot dog that seems lighter, or air filled.  When I mentioned lighter, I mean that they weights next to nothing.  The bun weights more.  Combined with it's lack of taste, you wonder what you were eating.  In a blindfolded test, you would never guess.For the record, we had couple of Original Hot Dogs, a Polish sandwich Meal deal (which was much better then the dogs), Jalapeno Poppers, Chili fries and two sodas which all amazingly came to $12 or so for the two of us.  They also charge 25 cents extra for a second ranch dressing for the poppers.  Six poppers and only one sauce?  The employees behind the counter were fine.  They were not a factor in on our decision to skip this place in the future.  In the end, it was just the food that was tasteless and uninspiring.  Admitedly, we did not try their Angus beef hot dogs.  So maybe we were missing something from the Weinerschnitzel experience.  Ehh!~~#~0
I ordered  pasta bolognese.  Found what looked like a very long piece of dental floss in it.. The five others at my table couldn't believe their eyes.  I brought this to the waiters' attention and he made light of it. I did not finish the dish.   I expected it to be eliminated from the bill.  It wasn't.I can't wait to go back.Too bad, I've been there before and enjoyed my meal.~~#~0
I stayed at the Westin Kierland from October 12 to 14 in a Deluxe Room. We checked in around 10:00pm and the only room available was on the second floor (main floor) #2163.Pros:- Check in and check out was very smooth. - The Kierland Flowrider was very fun and "Wavemaster" Steve and the attending lifeguard were very attentive and willing to help and give tips on using the machine and surfing- Resort is beautifulCons:- The spa was mediocre and the spa attendants lost our reservation- "Overpriced coconut water" - My girlfriend- Walls between rooms are very thin. You can hear what people are doing in the next room.- Bathrooms in the deluxe room are quite petite- Room was not thoroughly cleaned from the previous guest. Meal cards were filled with previous guests name.   Major Con:- Room #2163 has BED BUGS!!!!!!!! I awoke the next morning with rashes all over my body.- Stay aware from Nellie's Monday Club Cafe. I ordered the whole wheat pasta with shrimp and it made my stomach sick. Try something else.Recommendations:- If you are staying in room #2163 please inquire if room has been thoroughly cleaned and beware of bed bugs.- Overnight parking is $27/night but parking lot is close by to walk- The saloon makes a decent burger.~~#~0
My review is for the Golf Course as I've never stayed at the hotel.This course was one of the first courses in Arizona to have grass on it and has hosted a number of U.S. Presidents in it's time. It is a staple of the City of Chandler, and it is surrounded by beautiful large custom homes. The course has gone through it's share of ups and downs during it's almost century long existence, and unfortunately it seems to be at it's worst right now. I played on this course this last Sunday and was so disappointed. There was hardly any grass left on the course, the sand traps were like concrete, and the greens were in terrible shape. One of the pro's said that the course is in receivership and they are hoping someone will buy it and bring it back to it's once great self. As of right now they are placing band-aids on it and it shows. I would call ahead and ask the shape of the course before playing, and until they at least start watering it again, I'd avoid it. Very sad.~~#~0
On recommendation from a friend, I recently tried Lolas. He told me to go to the central location, but I was in the area, so I stopped into this one. Upon entering, I ordered two drip coffees for my boyfriend and I. The response I got was, "I'm not brewing anymore drip today." Apparently, they close at 7 and 6:15 is too late for coffee in a coffee shop. I then suggested she could make us Cafe Americano's instead. I asked for skim milk in one of them, and in response, a gallon of skim milk was slammed down in front of me. As I sat drinking my watered down cafe americano, the barista began sweeping around us. The dirt was flying everywhere. At that moment, I decided we needed to leave. The only thing keeping me from taking a steaming shit on the floor was the 3 cops sitting in the corner of the shop. I'd rather get coffee at a shell station. I suggest you do the same.~~#~0
I had a coupon for another place that apparently closed, so we wound up here.  Oops.  We thought other names for the place might be:  China Minimum.  China Don't.  China Ridden Hard And Put Away Wet.The service was nice enough but nothing else was.  The lipstick on the spoon that came with my daughter's egg drop soup pretty much set the tone.  The veggie chow fun and the veggie fried rice were sub-unremarkable.  The baby corn was overly large (we called it toddler corn) and had a musty flavor.  Ug.  The chow fun tasted mostly of soy sauce.  The veggie fried rice was OK.  Oh, we started with crab puffs.  They were overly oily and had no crab flavor.Just call it China Don't and leave it at that.~~#~0
Wow, this place was beyond a disappointment-- it really was horrible. The kind of horrible where all you can really focus on is getting out because you KNOW it's just so bad that there is nothing they can do to rectify it if you were to complain.  It was that bad. Someone else on here commented that the chef should cook for a school cafeteria, and I think that was being too kind and generous!We ordered a few appetizers and split an entree.  All three apps came with the same disgusting sauce which was obviously a bizarre mixture of ketchup and duck sauce. Totally gross.  They served this same sauce with the egg rolls, tempura vegetables (so terrible) and the tempura tofu, which on the menu said came with peanut sauce. Things were so bad that at one point we joked that maybe we were on candid camera, being pranked or something.  The entree was awful too, veggies were overcooked and soggy and even the darned white rice was overcooked and pasty. Unbelievable.I thought at least I wasn't paying full price because i was using a restaurant.com certificate, but this horrific lunch still cost us $25 after taking $10 off!!  What they don't put in the fine print is that you cannot order off the lunch menu for your certificate, even though it says can only be used at lunch, you have to order off their regular more expensive dinner menu. Great.  So then they also work in an 18% gratuity charge onto your total before computing the tax. So they include the tip in the taxable amount????    Crimity!  Yes, they did.Take my word for it, my husband and I have been to many, many Thai restaurants and this takes the prize for the absolute worst one ever. Anywhere else would be better.  Our fave still remains Yupha's or Wild Thaiger.We should have run the other direction when we arrived at 1pm to a totally empty place. I always try not to think that's a bad sign, but it always is....always!~~#~0
I often go to the J W Marriott Camelback Inn for happy hour  and dinner with coworkers and to their amazing spa, so I thought I would try the Desert Ridge resort and left disgruntled!  The service was terrible!!!  We sat on the patio and ordered appetizers, drinks and an entree.  We asked our waitress, Brandi for water on 2 separate occasions and when she finally brought it she only had one and said "sorry, someone else asked for your water so I gave it to them.  I will bring you another one."  We ordered a cheese plate and wanted to know which cheeses were on it since I have an allergy to blue cheese.  Well Brandi told us "I don't know what cheeses are on it, but I ordered it for you anyway.  It is no big deal to comp it if you don't like it".  I'm not worried about paying for the $10 cheese plate, I just wanted to know if it had blue cheese!Then there was the valet... I picked up my car after paying the $4.80 valet charge (who charges $4.80 for valet anyway?) and he gave me the keys. They forgot to check that the numbers matched, so he chased down my car and made me stop so they could retrieve the number!One more thing...I was in the lobby and asked an employee who was standing near the elevator where the nearest restroom was.  He informed me "all the guest rooms have restrooms".I'm sticking to Camelback, but have to say I am a bit annoyed that they are at all affiliated with this hotel.~~#~0
Not too sure I will go back here.  I was not big on the music they played (a lot of rap and interesting crowd) Service was good.~~#~0
105F outside! 90F inside!2 days with no dependable A/C in the summer.Staff said I was "doing it wrong" LOLMoved to a new room with working A/C on 3rd night.Numerous issues with room keys. Locked out twice.Mgr. gave $23.00 credit for 3 night stay.~~#~0
Wow, what an absolute shame.  This place has an amazing menu and the food looks delicious, but the service is so bad you may never get to eat.  I never give folks a hard time and try to be as patient as possible, but trying to have breakfast here is painfull.  There is no organization and you don't know wether to seat yourself or talk to the wait staff.  We wandered to a two top and sat down.  When the waitress finally approached us we told her we had never eaten there and asked for a recomendation.  she just stared at us blankley and said she didn't know.  She left us to go get drinks (1 coffee, 1 oj and 1 water that were never refilled or even offered). We ordered and after a wait the wrong order came to the table.  The place is very small with a small patio and there were three wait staff running the front of the house, but they all seemed more concerned with arguing about who was doing what then helping the customers.  In the hour and a half it took to get through breakfast more then 30 people came to the door to try to be seated and were not talked to at all.  when people around us finally were able to pay and leave their tables remained dirty and unseated while a line formed at the door.  This place would be amazing if it had a better staff or a manager to help run the front of the house.  Sorry guys, not coming back.~~#~0
I'm sorry, but cutting up imperfect blankets & linens & putting them in the dumpster (just saw an employee doing this) instead of donating them to churches, homeless shelters, stray rescue places....not ok. Shame on you!!!!~~#~0
I will never buy tires there again!Every time I go in there they try to sell me 4 new tires! WTF! I just bought 4 tires at Christmas. Took them in to get rotated and the guy says "we'll take a look at them". I said, "I just want them rotated, they are 5 months old". He comes back and says they are not looking very good. Are you kidding me???Never again will I go there, nor will I ever refer them. I'm done!~~#~0
We went, twice, to try their mid-day menu, which is served from 3-5 p.m., as opposed to their lunch menu, which is served at mid-day.Confused already?  On our first attempt, they were just open for dinner, so no dice, but we were told that they'd be fully open as of the following day.  So we went back at 4 p.m. the following day only to find no food available until 5, at which point they start on their dinner menu.  Clearly the staff are confused by the whole thing as well.Might go back in a while once things have bedded in, but off our list for now.~~#~0
This poor review is strictly regarding my experience with the tennis courts. I played a tennis match here and found out from my opponent that almost ALL the courts have dead spots where the ball dies.I would not recommend playing tennis matches here unless they fix the dead spots.~~#~0
This markets niche seems to focus on the low end shopper. it lacks value and quailty. Carries lots of private label brands you find the the dollar store. If you can afford to buy better food than avoid shopping here~~#~0
well, where do I begin...my move from phoenix to chicago took place on april 16 and they lost 3 of my very expensive bikes along the way. Ill finish my review once they actually get back to us with the "extra" insurance we paid for to cover for replacement. Oh and by the way today is may 4....and they have not called us once. We keep calling and getting the run around. My finished review will take place after we see how they take care of our stolen bike issue.~~#~0
I live very close to Jason's Deli. For a long time, I ate there at least once a week. Last time I visited Jason's Deli, I ordered a chicken salad wrap with tomato and found a metal staple in my food. I have not been back since...~~#~0
Will not recommend this place to any of my family and friends living in Tolleson. The food was not good at all. Service was bad, she never came back to refill my coffee cup, which was the only thing I enjoyed.~~#~0
Before visiting Meatballz, I thought the other negative reviewers were being harsh. They weren't.. I ordered the half meatball sandwich and soup combo. They said they couldn't fill the order because on Sundays they usually use their leftover Saturday bread and they didn't have much extra because it was Halloween and they got slammed earlier in the day and were out. So I said fine, and ordered the penne and chicken 'parmesan' instead. It was terrible. The chicken was a fake chicken breast with fake grill marks and was tough when chewing. One bite was more than enough. The parmesan was melted rubbery cheese. And the penne was straight out of the box and the marinara was watery & disgusting. I am not overly sensitive, but I write this now with a very nauseous feeling.My wife's meatball sliders were straight out of the freezer and into the microwave. NOthing against the cooks, they obviously just get the frozen drivel out of the cooler and nuke it for a minute. Actually, the cooks were the best part of the experience, since they actually had to serve us our food and also the guy waiting for his takeout...because the only girl working was outside talking to the only other customers for 15-20 minutes.....and that's not an exaggeration. Not to mention, two tables of food (one untouched), sat there the entire time without being cleared.We won't be back, and honestly, I am not sure how this place has lasted so long with food, service and management this poor. Steer clear.~~#~0
This used to be a favorite place of mine. The service standards have gone downhill quite a bit. One example is I waited 10 minutes for a refill on iced tea, at the bar. The food is still outstanding, but I think I will take my hard earned money to Sal's Gilbert Pizza. You have truly let me down Pesto's.~~#~0
I've been here once, and I will only go here once. I met my husband and some friends there after work sometime in February, when it was still cold enough at night to require jackets and outdoor heaters to sit outside. We were seated in a dark corner of the patio, where there were THREE portable heaters, none of which were turned on. We asked our ditzy, busty, DUMB waitress FOUR TIMES to turn them on, and she kept saying, "I'll have to ask someone to do it. I don't know how."  I finally asked her WHO she had to ask, and she pointed to the dirty looking guys acting as bouncers at the gate, who apparently are the only ones in the joint authorized to turn on the heat lamps. Fine. I walked over to them and asked if we could get our heaters turned on, and the guy walked right over and did it for us. Took all of 30 seconds. Oh, and it took about 45 minutes for our food to arrive, and when it did, several of the orders were messed up. And the waitress didn't care. And it wasn't that good. Can you tell I didn't really care for this place (note my frequent use of all-caps)? And yet it will continue on, because college students will continue to buy their beer and flaccid fries as long as ASU is there.Ah well. We can't all have as refined taste as I.OK, as long as I'm in pretentious snob mode, I'd like to point out that one of the reviews of this establishment excuses the small oyster portions because "we're in a dessert." Um...stripper jumping out of a cake? Or do you really not know how to spell DESERT?Yowza. I'm usually nicer.~~#~0
AVOID!! AVOID!!  IF YOU WANT TO BE FOOD POISONED, GO HERE!! AVOID! AVOID!First of all the female manager is an absolute JERK!  She has an attitude of arrogance with a side of rudeness!! Wonderful combination!I've been going to Jamba Juice in ALL locations including California and have NEVER experienced ANYTHING like what I experienced here!Every time I've ordered an extra boost of whey or soy protein and another "free boost" they offer, IF the drink is made correctly and with the FULL INGREDIENTS, there is ALWAYS too much drink for the cup you ordered so the server automatically gives you the bigger cup to hold all the extra... WHEN I'M PAYING ALMOST $5 FOR A SIXTEEN OUNCE DRINK, YOU BETTER BELIEVE I WANT ALL THAT I PAID FOR!!!There have been times that I've had to ask the "newer" servers to put into a larger cup but for the most part, HAVE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH THIS except when I went to the GREENFIELD / MCKELLIPS Jamba Juice and had to deal with this manager.She actually INSISTED that any drink left in the mixer was Jamba Juice's and not the customer!!  She REFUSED to place all of the drink in the larger cup. I have gone round and round with this manager moron at least 5-6 times AND obviously the "customer is always right" doesn't apply here!  I finally got fed up and told her I went to the Jamba Juice on Gilbert / University and talked to them and they just shrugged, saying, "We always give the customer a bigger cup... they've paid extra, so we feel it's theirs. We don't quite understand why this manager is doing this, but that store is a separate franchise and are probably not following the Jamba Juice way."I went back on Saturday and there the manager was at the cash register. When she saw me, she immediately turned and went to the back room and didn't come back. Another server had to come off the mixing line and as she walked to the cash register to help me, looked through the door window of the office (I could tell she was puzzled as to why the manager abruptly left).  I ordered and did my spiel about putting the extra in the larger cup and she nodded.At the same time about 10 people came into the store and got in line to order and immediately the manager came out to wait on them... hmmm, I wonder if it is me?I watched the gal make my drink and she placed it into the mixer.  I turned away and looked out the window to check my son who was in the car and as I turned around, I saw the manager putting a scoop of white powder into my drink and then she started the mixer again.  I was STUNNED!!  I started to say, "What are you doing?" and she immediately went back into the back room again.  I got really angry and said, "What is going on?... Why would she put that powder in my drink?  What is the powder substance?" The gal that waited on me stated she was going to find out & went into the back room and came out a minute later.  She said, "the manager said you always want whey protein and she saw that I put soy protein in you drink and made it wrong."  I very agitated at this point, exclaimed, "So instead of making me a NEW drink, you sabotage my juice with TOO MUCH protein and make it taste like CRAP!!?!!"By this time everyone in the place was just trying to figure out what was going on with this manager... I said in a very loud voice that I was leaving and I was going to contact the corporate offices as well as the HEALTH DEPARTMENT!!  Obviously I left WITHOUT my poisoned drink nor an offer of getting my money back!At the very least this manager needs to be fired and have since learned that what she did with my drink can be a felony... how do I know what this white powder was that she put in my drink?  This CRAZY, WHACKED OUT Manager MORON needs to be behind bars and have her food handlers card REVOKED immediately!!I contacted the corporate office and they called me and said they were sending a "team" to investigate this situation right away.  I filled out a formal written complaint with the health department as well as contacting the City of Mesa Police Department for attempted poisoning.  She needs to be in jail!~~#~0
So I figured out why this place has 5 from one and 1 from another.... It is owned ny our friends up North. Yep The super nice yet bland group we call Canadians. They have created a tourist trap that appeals to tourist and lovers of SW crap. LOLHere is a copy of the business plan. Lets create a super nice place that attracts people to it, eah? (cuz they end the sentence with a question)But we do know anything about Mexican food?Lets make it so neat just to be in the place that we will get by on our looks? Eah?OKAAY... make sure the drinks are good.~~#~0
I don't get the appeal of Portland's the space is terribly designed, modern in a bad way.  My biggest problem is the food.  I ordered a  hamburger had a few bites and was done.  I could have sent it back, but I was having such a lousy time I decided it wasn't worth hanging around.  The funny thing is that a lot of people that I work with think Portland's is a great place...I had high expectations.  I won't be back.  There are much better options in the vicinity.~~#~0
OK...I just walked back into my hotel room after a meal at this place. I think I'm being overly generous by even giving them one star.  Fact of the matter is I had no choice but to give them one because there was nothing lower.I had the #5 combination which consisted of one cheese enchilada (which was 1/100th of a percent decent), one shredded beef hard shell taco (which was perhaps the best thing on the plate), and one bean tostada (stale tostada).  I also ordered an overpriced ($7.95) chile relleno a la carte that tasted more like an "effen" omelette.  C'mon now!!! The consistency of the egg covering the chile relleno should be fluffy and quickly fried.  This thing looked like and tasted as if they first made an Omelette and then wrapped it around a steamed chile....the chile wasn't even fire roasted!!!! Friends, I know real Mexican food....FINE Mexican food for that matter and this place IS NOT IT!  With all due respect to those of you who have written rave reviews about this place and of course to the proprietors, BUT I think I would have had a much better meal at the nearest taco bell, gladly paying the $25 bucks I laid down for a less than mediocre meal.  My recommendation to you all is .....DON'T BOTHER.  They should really consider dropping the "FINE" from the name of this establishment.On a good note - The lady tending bar that evening was very very nice and attentive.... unfortunately the service alone can't hold this place up.~~#~0
Had this for lunch one day before work - bad move. I was totally useless all afternoon as I felt like I had a brick of acid eating away at my stomach lining.~~#~0
Sorry to have to write this review. But if the owner improves the issues I bring up here, and/or if you as a customer can negotiate these issues with Feri, then you may have a good experience. But I did not.I brought in a pair of men's slacks to be hemmed and have the seat taken in. I asked for a price, and didn't get a straight answer. I asked again and was quoted something around $20. I thought it was a lot for the alteration, but I decided to go for it, expecting good work. I paid in advance and was told to pick up my pants in a few days.When I returned, I discovered that the seat was taken in, but the pants still weren't hemmed. Feri claimed that one cannot get the inseam sized properly until after the seat was done and the pants were resized. In the 30 years I've been getting alterations, this has never been requested of me. But okay - at least she's conscientious.After she marks the leg hems, I learn that she is going to charge me another $15 for the hems. What? I already paid $20. $35 for one pair of slacks? I also have never been charged twice for one item's alterations, and never been nickled-and-dimed like this before. And I told her so. I strongly feel that this approach is manipulative. I told her that unless she completed the work for the previously agreed upon price, I was taking my slacks elsewhere.She apologized and we negotiated some cheaper price. I really think that I had paid enough, but whatever, I'm a softie. I could tell Feri wasn't a happy camper about my hard-line, but I really sincerely believe that the money I paid is a fair price for the amount of time and effort and thread and overhead involved. Here's my big mistake though: I had her do another pair of slacks. This time the seat was really baggy and I needed it taken in a bit. She hesitated (and she hesitated about taking in the seat of the other pants too), but I explained I didn't like walking around with an extra 6" of fabric below my crotch. I paid her for this alteration also. When I picked the pants up and tried them on at home, I discovered she had taken in the seat so much that she had turned these REI cargo pants into Britney jeans - the seat was so taken in that the waistband now barely came up above my buttocks. Also, the seat was somehow crooked, so that there was a gather of fabric on one side of the crotch of these pants. When I walked, I could feel the crooked seat panel rub against my inner thigh. Of course I already decided I wouldn't return. But the clincher was this: Less than 3 months later, having worn these slacks maybe 10 times, the seat completely ripped out in the crotch in two directions, leaving frayed fabric. Since the pants were already so tight, there is no extra fabric to allow for a new seam there. So my new $55 + $25 in alterations pants are garbage after only a few months. Great. (The 1st pair of pants, dress pants, are okay.)Suggestions: (1) Clear pricing. This is not brain surgery, and I remember not many years ago many tailors had prices posted in their shops. (2) None of this incremental charging - When I take in an item and say "How much to take in the seat and hem the legs?" One price should be quoted. Not one price now and another one later. (3) If you require alterations to be done in several steps, say so. I have never had to have pants altered in multiple steps in my life before. It's okay if Feri does things this way, but she should say so. After all, it's inconvenient to come in multiple times for one pair of pants. (4) If you aren't comfortable or skilled enough to take in a pants' seat properly, say so and don't ruin somebody's clothing.~~#~0
I won a "free" oil change at Sun Devil Auto through the local soccer program.  When I had the oil changed, they stripped the threads on not only the oil plug, but also on the oil pan.  Their solution to the problem was to plug it with a bigger plug and said they would have to charge me to replace the pan.  The oil, however, is still leaking.  Meanwhile, there is no place in town that will change my oil without me replacing the pan.  This "free" oil change is costing me a fortune!!!~~#~0
Crowded, pushy, noisey unimaginative.  Do not bother.~~#~0
DON'T DO IT!  This hotel falls the shortest of all standards at any Best Western I have ever stayed in over the last 22 years!!!  The basics? = no internet service, no refrigerator and no microwave...and this being in the second most expensive "suite" on the property!  The staff was apologetic and explained to us that the owner/manager was "too cheap to supply all the rooms with the basics.  So, they only have 5 or each that they rotate between rooms!"  As far as internet, I was told "good luck getting that".In addition, the room was right on the main street, which we found out after the fact that it's the main route for all the supply trucks in the neighborhood...all night long!  At almost $200 a night, I'd rather not feel like I'm sleeping under a truck.Then and even though the staff showed us other available rooms that we would have been more than happy to switch to, the manager would do nothing about it and could not have been more rude.Not sure who they think they are at this property, but do yourselves a favor and pick one of the many other, much nicer for the $$$$, hotels in the Scottsdale area!!!~~#~0
Not clean. Poor service. Attitudes. Not helpful. Insensitive. Rude. WACK~~#~0
Use to be good.  This time broke the mirror (I took pictures).  3 weeks still no word from them on repairs.  Today went in with husband, and found PJ, the owner, refuses to fix.  Thank goodness I took pictures for proof..~~#~0
This place is so frustrating. Its such a great lounge with a great atmosphere and look. Not to mention the DJ's and music they pull into that place is usually amazing localites. UNFORTUNATELY, this bar does not really understand how to market itself nor how to promote. If you plan on having a drink and wanting to be ALONE you will definitely get it most nights of the week. Drinks are ok.~~#~0
Ok...I am into dive bars.  This place is not a dive bar, it is just plain filth.  I never felt so disgusting in a drinking establishment in my life.   My drink was horrible and my partner in crime was getting hit on by some nasty guy with sores on his face.  People were playing beer pong on a ping pong table...which then made me feel like I was 16 years old.  I am actually embarassed for this place.~~#~0
I can't really write a very detailed description on this because we stayed only for 10 minutes. After walking in and finding that my husband and I were the youngest in there, by like 30 years, we had one round of nasty tasting drinks and left.  On a plus, the waitress was very nice. The atmosphere not so much. We didn't get a chance to taste the food.~~#~0
I have tried this place a couple of times because it is conveniently located but I wont be going back.  The first time I went there were 4 people in line ahead of me and it took 15 minutes to get my coffee.  The second time I went I ordered a vanilla latte but they forgot to add the flavor shot.  The coffee was not good enough to make up for the bad service.~~#~0
2 words - Mosquito infestation. Never again. Figure your shit out Doubletree because showering in a bathroom with 20 to 30 mosquitoes is nasty. I don't care that I got a free cookie or that the beds were comfortable now I have to worry about west nile. Gross.~~#~0
The worst cleaners ever. Moronic and rude women. My comforter was due on tuesday. I go in on wednesday and they tell me to drive to their other store to look into it since they weren't answering the phone. No, I won't. Called late wednesday and they say maybe it will be done on friday... Never again.~~#~0
My partner and I went to Eddie's House prior to her art show opening at a nearby gallery.  We planned on Eddie's as a start to a very special evening.  We were seated on the patio and it took our waiter 7 minutes to greet us and ask us if we would like drinks.  We ordered drinks and waited another 10 minutes for them to arrive.  When he brought them he made no mention of the long wait.  We ordered an appetizer to share and then a large vegetable platter to share as our main course.  He brought everything out at once which was not what we asked for.  We ate our dinner and asked for the bill upon completion as we were leaving to get to the art show.  We waited and waited...and waited.  I went inside to try to find him with no luck.  20 minutes later he brought the bill out.   The food was average and over priced.  We were charged for a small dish of extra pita bread to supplement the original small serving that arrived with the hummus.  All in all it was a disappointing experience due primarily to the dismissive behavior by our waiter.  I called Eddie's House the next day to share my feedback and got Eddie on the phone.   I started telling him about my experience and he he acted like I was interrupting him.    He asked if he could call me right back and confirmed my phone number with me.  He never called back.  I will never return to Eddie's House after this poor example of customer service.  There are too many other quality restaurants in Scottsdale to dine in who treat customers like they are worth the effort to be courteous.~~#~0
I stopped into Meineke yesterday because my battery was obviously about to die. Now, I should start by saying I used to live right by this Meineke and in the past they have always done a great job at a fair price. Yesterday however, they told me that my battery was bad, and I needed to take it back to wherever it had been installed as it was still under warranty. I had had it installed THERE, a few years earlier, but for some reason they had no record of it. I was told that without proof of this, it would be over $230 for a new battery installation. I don't know a lot about cars but I DO know that is insanely high for a new battery for my 2002 Toyota. I took it over to Fletcher Tires and they got me a new battery in 15 minutes for $90 and they were absolutely as nice as could be. I was hesitant to write this review as I have had good service in the past. However the attitude the one gentleman had and the huge price difference really rubbed me the wrong way, so consider yourselves warned!~~#~0
This place is closed and the shopping center is not very nice.~~#~0
Bets, Booze, & DEBAUCHERY!Too bad the owner (as she identified herself about 15-20 times) is a complete nut case! Not only does she belittle her employees in front of customers while sitting at the bar getting drunk, she actually yells at customers and kicks them out for no reason while she is completely wasted!Trust me, I was a witness to this about a week ago when she made a huge scene and the police were supposedly called...talk about a buzz kill. CHECK PLEASE!!I enjoyed going here because its close to home and the bartenders are friendly while making sure your glass is never empty; but after last weeks display of drunken "debauchery" I will never visit this establishment again. When I go out it is for fun and to relax, not to deal with drama that involves an owner who can't control herself!If you go to this bar you run the risk of having to deal with a monster that will do anything to make sure she has a good time before her customers do. Have fun!~~#~0
Ordered the Carnitas burrito, as well as the steak burrito. I also ordrered the cheese quesadillas with chicken.The pork was WAY TOO SALTY!  I couldn't finish it without drinking a ton.Figured that it was a fluke from a heavy-handed cook with that one particular burrito, so dug into the steak, and found it to be just as as salty. What a disappointment.The quesadillas were not bad.However, with how salty the two  burritos were, I can not recommend Desert Springs.~~#~0
This place is the rip off of all rip offs. My boyfriend and I decided to go there for lunch over the summer. We ordered drinks from the bar, ridiculously priced for a restaurant during the day, $9.50 for some mojitos? Come on. They weren't that good. Now we were starving when we arrived, I ordered the tilapia and asparagus and he order the meatloaf and potatoes. We received our food and he dug in right away. I just sat and looked at mine. "Fourteen dollars for this? How much was yours, eleven dollars?" My boyfriend looks at my plate and could only say, "That's it?" He received a FULL plate of meatloaf and the other half of mashed potatoes. I had six stalks of asparagus and a piece of fish the size of a child's hand. That was it. I called the waiter over and asked him if all the fish were this size and he said he thought so and there was nothing wrong with my meal. I asked him if this was worth $14 to him and he said he thought so. I told him, "I'm not from Scottsdale, I would like to see the manager." The manager walks over and proceeds to actually argue with me about the food saying that it is perfectly fine. I said, "It may be fine, it may taste great, but I'm still going to be hungry after this $14 meal. I would at least like another piece of fish." He tells me for $6 he could get me one more piece of fish and I tell him I'm not paying that for another piece this size. At this point my boyfriend is offering me his food, but that's not what I wanted. Finally I tell the manager just take it back, I'm sorry to see you toss that but you are doing nothing to satisfy this customer. He literally did nothing but argue with me. I wasn't trying to get a free meal, I just wanted to get what I was paying for. Rude people, overpriced food, crappy bar. Take your business somewhere else.~~#~0
Why did did i come back here?  a 40 min drive north for what?!  with 200 fantastic places near me, i certainly do NOT have to drive to be treated like a LEPER by a snotty, uppity, arogant server!When we walked into the bar area, the entire bar was empty.  For seating, there were 2 tables: 1 person seated at a table, 2 at the other.  The girl behind the bar acted frenzied, hurried, and like she wsa serving 37 people.  NO TIME FOR US - who were NOT LOCALS !  was the crisp and very clear message.The CRAP wine by the glass advertised on the chalk board was enough to send me running out the door: $5/glass for what is sold for the bottle retail (gnarly head, voga, 3 rivers - KAK!).I went over to the wine rack, and she said the Long Meadow Cab was on sale, instead of $60, she offered it for $45.  Since I had not had it previously, i was hesitant.  But I spotted a 1/2 bottle, so (i thought) i was in luck!!  I asked her how much (thinking it would be HALF of the full bottle - like $22?!?!)   NOT!  She said it was also the same price ?!  W T H ?!  are you kidding me?Husband walked out, i followed.... (especially after seeing her treat another 2 walk in's in a deplorable way - no reason to treat people like they are beneath you - EVER!)~~#~0
We had their Groupon and decided to try it on our way up to North Phoenix.  We ordered the Green Chili and Beef Frybread Taco and their Red Chili Stew to go. We ate the frybread while driving. The whole thing was absolutely bland. I found 1 sliver of beef in the whole thing. Very disappointing. I suggested to my fiancée that maybe the stew would be better. I grabbed the bag from the floor board and set it in my lap. I took out the frybread, and instantly felt the worst pain on my thigh. The boiling-hot magma stew had soaked through the bag and sent a raging inferno to my inner thigh. Yelling and crying, I set the bag on the flood board.  We pulled into a Walgreens to grab some burn ointment and clean my jeans off. I tried moving the bag and the paper tore and the rest of the stew spilled on the floor.  Advice for the restaurant: if you want repeat business, don't serve still-boiling stew to new customers in a g-d paper cup!.~~#~0
We came in here to have a few drinks before going across the street for dinner. As soon as we sat down at the bar, the bartender (who couldn't speak English very well) comes over. I immediately ask her to relay the happy hour specials. $3.99 house wines, and $2 drafts. My companion has a budlight draft, I choose a house pino grigio. We ended up staying for two rounds. The bartender disapears and we ask the "manager" for the check. After he brings it over we notice that my wine was $10 a glass. After explaining to the "manager" that we came in here for the happy hour. He says he will go ask the "owner" in back. He comes back, shrugs his shoulders and says that there is nothing he can do. Meanwhile the bartender (who can settle this) is still nowhere to be found. I explain to him that I live very close by and usually come here to watch football on sundays, but sadly I will not be returning. He says "Oh.... let me ask the owner again" and walks back. At that point, I had enough. It wasn't about the money. I stood up, left money on the bar and walked out. This place is a joke.~~#~0
Got a flyer for this place on our door and decided to give it a try.  Worst red chili mix burro, ever!  I also ordered an iced tea and the cashier pulled it out of the fridge...  I honestly think the tea was a few days old.  Not sure how this place has two locations... I will never return.~~#~0
If this is the one in the Phoenix Center, I would like to say that while the food was good and the atmosphere great (my first time going to the center) we were stuck with perhaps the worst waitress there. Though she was more than happy take our order for appetizers and drinks... once we said we are not sure about eatting dinner yet... she promptly took order and not until almost an hour later, brought our bill only because I asked th hostess. We watched as she chatted with other tables and visited them often, we were ignored. I had to ask the hostess for the waters that were to be brought to us and eventually the check.  The manager came over as my guest had to ask him for more pitas. Overall for not even a busy night, her service was deplorable. I would NOT be going back there but rather the Scottsdale and Tempe offices are a much better choice and awesome service.   Goes to show one, don't mention you want appetizers and drinks and will decide on dinner later... you will get substandard service. For what could have been a few extra drinks, dinner and desserts and a hefty tip for the waitress...we left having only one drink each and shared two appetizers... the hostess who was awesome got the good tip. Only wishes I would have gotten the name of the bad one. :)~~#~0
Great beer selection, and very good food except the service was so pathetically slow, it isn't worth it. Waited an hour for a pizza, and our friends, sitting with us waited an additional 10 for theirs. Have a beer here, they have a fantastic selection, but eat somewhere else.~~#~0
BUH-BYE, JON KYL!   ...Now, if we can only get rid of McLame & Brewer!  ...right???~~#~0
Wow...where to begin with this place?  I call up the night of going there to see if a reservation was needed.  They tell me they always suggest a reservation....so i proceed to see if they have anytime available for 8 o clock that evening.  They do...Great!!  I head over to Sutra which is the "new" sushi place to go to in scottsdale.  Excited to try some new sushi in town we walk in to an 80% empty restaurant wondering why they suggested we make a reservation??  The restaurant looked identical to the previous lounge that occupied this space, La Rouge.  There were minimal changes and the same furniture remained which i thought was disappointing.  I thought they would have given Sutra its own identity.  They might as well had called it La Rouge and told people they now serve sushi.  The next disappointing thing about Sutra was the service....BRU-TAL!!  Im talking painful to sit through.  The waitress came over and introduced herself and asked if we wanted drinks.  We wanted to see their wine list along with the martini list.  She had to make two seperate trips to find both of these menus.  Finally she delivered the menus to us as if they were the only menus in the restaurant and we were lucky to have received them.  Then, after looking over the sushi menu for 20 minutes and finally deciding on what we wanted, the waitress came over to look over our order and make sure she was aware of everything we wanted.  After she looked it over she asks, ":Oh, did they tell you what the deal was tonight??"  We all looked at each other and said, "No, whats the deal here tonight?'  She says, "We are not serving any hot food tonight and any of the sushi that contains tempura (a fried breading) is not available, however, edamame and miso soup are still available.  Hmmm...."Why didnt they mention that when i made a reservation" I pondered.  And why didnt the server mention this the first three times she visited our table for that matter.  Half the items that we ordered were immediatly eliminated and we had to go back to the drawing board and figure out what we wanted.  Finally, we decide and the waitress takes our order.  As the night progressed the service and experience just got more interesting.  The food was brought out by runners and the waitress had no clue what had been brought out and what hadnt.  She was asking US what still needed to come out.  Kinda weird...thought that was her responsibility to know what still needed to come out??  So after eating a few mediocre rolls of sushi we all decided that we were full and couldnt eat anymore.  We asked the server to cancel the last two dishes that hadnt arrived yet.  She looked at us like we were from Mars and said, "Oh, you guys didnt get everything?"  She canceled the remaining dishes and proceeded to talk to us for literally a half hour.  "About what" you are wondering.  I have no clue...all i know is that i felt 1000 times dumber after she was done.  So, I think you get the idea.  This place should live about as long as La Rouge did...and hopefully not that long.  This was a painful dining experience.  Very disappointing coming from the people that own Barcelona and Danny's car washes.  This dinner was more annoying than the guys at the car washes that ask you if you want your windshield repaired everytime you go to fill up!  SUCKED...Dont go!~~#~0
"I'm sorry your food is taking so long. Half our staff was at the culinary festival today and their a little, you know, drunk."I'm paraphrasing a little bit but this was the rationale given to our group of 6 for why it took over an hour for our noodles. Our server gave this answer to our pleas for our food with a straight face - apparently at this restaurant it's ok for staffers to be late, drunk, and provide bad service if there is a beer garden and/or Absolut tent within 10 blocks.We were excited about checking this place out but on our way in we found some of the less-than--stellar reviews on this site. Uh oh. We went anyways and I can now happily say that we won't be going back.If you like paying way too much money for inconsistently portioned food then this is your joint. If you don't want to have a conversation when you eat then this is your joint. If you want to be somewhere with a lame-o doorman and an actual rope line then this is your place.PROS:The toilets are cool.Karaoke rooms are cool.CONS:$13 for 6 quarter-sized meat medallions that you cook on a hot rock.No apologies from server for looong wait for food... but wait! They were getting blitzed at Culinary festival so all is forgiven...THE MUSIC WAS VERY VERY VERY LOUD.Ordered sake bombers and were given sake glasses that were too big for beer glass they came with - made for an interesting and wet first round.Doormen and rope lines are freakin' ridiculous.  Get over yourselves.Going to have video games? How 'bout not placing them in a 4-foot wide entryway.Drinks were reasonably priced and creative and the music, although very loud, was good so I give one star. Unfortunately there are too many other places within a 5-minute walk that also have great music and great drinks in a less pretentious atmosphere with real serving sizes. And with a serving/cook staffs that can do their job.P.S. We all went to college. When you put Ramen noodles on the menu we all know you can cook them up within 10 minutes. Why would it take 90-minutes at Geisha? Dunno...~~#~0
7.14.12.  After two months of waiting for someone to replace screws into the concrete block wall from the broken security gate--the company finally fixed this.  They also finally completed the pony wall 6 months later.  We got the landscaping contract after the job was finished last year, as we were afraid our plants would die, and we wanted some insurance.  Well, the landscaping crew just came yesterday.  It does not appear that they trimmed any of the plants/lantanas or trees.  There are two plants that died.  We have generally had to wait months before the plants have been replaced.  We'll see how long it takes them to replace the two that died.  Take a look at the pictures and tell me whether it looks like our yard has been serviced by a professional landscaping company.~~#~0
this placed have good foods but too exspensive for the portion and service they provide. bad service, menu too exspensive. not recomand for anybody that know how to eat thai foods. overall this place is a one star palce for a four star price..~~#~0
You have to forgive me as I am a little sad today. One of the cheapest, and best chicken places has gone totally down hill. In the world of fast food chicken places it is normally a choice between KFC or Church 's. In fact until today I would have said Church 's by a mile. Disagree? Then let 's talk price for a minute. When you can get eight pieces of chicken, four biscuits,  a side of mashed potatoes and gravy plus coleslaw all four around $10 then there is no choice involved. There is just me asking for some hot sauce and a pile of napkins. (LOL) But after moving to Michigan for a few years and having no choice but to pay the super high prices the colonel commands from his troops (customers),  I was looking forward to moving back to Arizona and some good fried chicken. But somehow things are never as great as you remember them. My first experience with Church 's was not only a disappointment but a slap in the face. Forgotten were the memories sweetened by the warm honey butter biscuits I used to enjoy. Gone were the days when I sat with my grandma and feasted on tasty fried chicken. Now all that remains is the smell of burned food that taste like it had been made three days before and reheated till it was almost charcoal.  I mean come on I like dark meat but this was ridiculous. Maybe to increase profits they were selling this cremated fowl as fuel to KFC to make their grilled chicken with (LOL). But seriously though the food was really bad. The biscuits looked like the kind you buy at the store just with a little smear of honey and were rock hard. This is to bad because they sold one of the better tasting biscuits sold by a chain ( KFC 's taste like they used to much flour, and Popeye 's is way to salty for my taste). The bottom line is with great power comes great responsibility. If you have a great product do not mess with it. Just keep cranking it out and offering it at a affordable price. Why? It is simple, because you will make a lot of money.(LOL) I only hope that someone at Church 's will awaken from this nightmare and start making the food that makes good memories instead of just making people sick.~~#~0
I have no idea why so many people go to this place.  Everything's so expensive, they never have any great deals and the food is mediocre at best.  My friend and I had 1 plate of nachos (appetizer) and 3 beers and the total came out to 30 dollars.  On top of this, the gratuity was added and the waitress didn't say anything so we accidentally tipped her more on top so we paid almost 50 dollars!  She could've let us know if she wasn't so greedy..  I tried to complain on the website but the only thing you can do is give them information to set up a party.  What a rackett!~~#~0
I trusted their testimonials on their web site and went with them. My house is a large rental house that just got vacated. For $300, 4 maid came and cleaned for 2&half hours. One is good, other 3 not so much plus bad attitude including the supervisor. Yes, they used a feather duster not wipe down. List of items I was not happy:- Stove remain as is. I had to clean it myself as their job was disgusting.- Left me with a drawful of ice which they should toss, the ice bin left unclean, bottom grid was so filthy you can see it from 3 ft away. The cleaning services I had before even moved the refri and mob under neath.- Tile floors doesn't look like it was mopped.- Left me with trash bags in the front patio- I paid extra $30 for sweeping the garage, Yes, they swept all trash right out in front and left me to pick them up. Trash was still visible at the back of the salt water system.-  House has high ceiling with ledges on top of the kitchen cabinets. There are thick dust on top which can be seen from upstair. They left it untouch!Well, right after the maids left, I called and spoke to a guy who took my project over the phone with assurance they do a good job.Apparently the maids told him house is dirty. His comment to me was I did not tell him the house was dirty over the phone. Who would pay $300 to a cleaning service for a house that is not dirty and don't need cleaning.He was the one who gave me phone quote based on size and rooms of the house and that I told him it is a tenant move out cleaning I need! He said he will send back the maids and he will call me back to confirm. Nothing happened and I am not waiting as I don't trust them to do any decent cleaning job.~~#~0
Interior is something to behold, but it's not impressive enough to keep one coming back. So, what about the drinks? Sangria is okay; margaritas aren't anything to write home about. So, what does this place offer? It's certainly not the grub. The salsa tastes like burnt rubber. The namesake dish (pink taco) is a mess on a plate. If you want to go to say you went - to say you had the pink taco - then go, but don't say I didn't warn ya. This place epitomizes all that's wrong in the world, or atleast what's defunct about Scottsdale. Flashy baubles, boobie bouncin' women, marked up mediocrity and the air of popularity that's so desired, service and quality are jeopardized. Uhm, no thanks.~~#~0
I got an insulting e-mail from a user defending the tap-system on prepiad light-rail passes so I feel the need to explain: Take notice that the prepaid cards are PREPAID. That is, they're NOT FREE. I Pay for them in ADVANCE ($200/semester when they are available). -Yet, the system requires a SILLY validation only for prepaid cards; which are already paid for, so they could just as easily be done on the train. There's absolutely no need to give a ticket to someone who has PREPAID their Fare. THE FINE IS COMPLETELY UNJUSTIFIED.  Ever stopped at the central stop to see all the HS students tap their cards at once? -It's a seriously deranged "plan"! The tap is superfluous, and any data derived from the tap has proved to be useless in the improvement of light rail over the years. -not withstanding my other complaints about the broken light-rail system in Phoenix.Among other things, the user who insulted me called me "irresponsible". Maybe if light rail was run by responsible people, it wouldn't be dangerous, gross, infrequent, overpriced, frustrating, embarrassing, slow, and ineffective.  Perhaps it would help the community by staying open later, so that after shows people can take Light-rail home and cut down on drunk-driving. Perhaps the tap system would be avoided, there might be space for the elderly and disabled at all times; people wouldn't have to take 3 hours out of their day for what would otherwise be a 30 minute commute. There might be light-rail parking at the stations, it might go just a tiny bit further to useful places like metro-center [the major bus hub) and the airport; FROM THE BEGINNING, not as an expensive afterthought that the voters wish they had the chance to deal with when there was a budget to use.The problems with light rail are so numerous to mention it's not appropriate for this forum.  ~But it's important that somewhere someone is telling the thousands of people who move to Phoenix in this time of econcomic crisis, that it's not the wonderland you see on TV.  Light rail is just a tiny symptom of a broken and corrupt system in this 'sunny place for shady people'. --If you want to know what is great about Phoenix, check out my more frequent 5 star reviews.~~#~0
I know there were others before me in the diner, but 15 mins for JUST cheese fries? :/~~#~0
First, let me say that I love Smashburger.  That being said, I can tell you that not all Smashburger locations are created equal.  This particular location does not live up to the standards of just about every other Smashburger store anywhere.I went with wife and another couple and it was their treat because I'd helped them get their new Kindle set up and we thought it would be a good idea to check out the newly opened Smashburger at Happy Valley and Lake Pleasant Rd.Very disappointing considering that we drove from Buckeye to Peoria for a little treat from a burger joint that we had previously just raved about (99th & McDowell).  Right off the bat I KNEW that this was going to be a bust.  When we ordered we were told that there were no fries left.  UH?  REALLY?  This was at 5PM and there no french fries at a burger joint?  That's like going to a fish & chips place and being told there were no chips.  Who the heck does the ordering for this place?Secondly, I was going to have a beer with my meal but guess what - NO BEER!  Again, I beg to ask, who the heck does the ordering for this place?  And lastly, it seemed like it took FOREVER for our order to come.  I mean, if you are just cooking 4 hamburgers with no fries, how hard can that be?  I was expecting to be told that they were out of hamburgers or buns.  The long wait for our food to arrive seem odd, especially when there isn't any crowd to speak of in the store.But the thing that really chapped my hide was when I went up the soda machine to refill my drink, I looked in the kitchen and saw that NOW there were orders of fries coming out to be served!  If I were working at that store and had customers that had been told there no french fries, I would have certainly offered some complimentary fries to those that wanted them, wouldn't you? As I said, I really have high praise for Smashburger, just not this newly opened store in Peoria.  It's a bit out of my way but I'll stick to the store in Avondale.~~#~0
I went into brakes plus because I was recommended by discount tire to get an alignment after my tires wore through too quickly. I made an appointment and dropped off my truck Monday morning. After having my vehicle for just over an hour I received a call from Charlie, who explained that I needed much more than an alignment. $1400 more to be exact. I explained that $1400 isn't easy to come by and I wanted to wait to do repairs since it was not immediately necessary, and I wanted to come and pick up my vehicle. After arriving I was met by high-pressure sales pitch to fix my vehicle. Since no work had actually been done I did not owe them any money and I wanted to leave. It took me nearly 20 minutes for them to give me my keys back so that I could leave. I left feeling very uncomfortable and decided to do some research into the local shops to get the work. I found that S/S tire came highly recommended by users on the Internet as well as the Better Business Bureau and went to see them instead. I'm so glad I did! They were very helpful and friendly and showed me exactly what was wrong with my car. It turns out I did need most of the repairs, however their total bill only came to $950. Brakes plus was trying to rip me off for almost $500 of unneeded parts and labor. Beware!!~~#~0
Being from Tucson, I used yelp to try and locate what is supposedly the best mexican food in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  I had high hopes when I arrived at this restaurant.  It is charming, and looks authentic.  Much like the restaurants down in Tucson.  The chips and salsa came out quick, and the service was great.  Chips and salsa were very good.  However, I was disappointed that you only get one serving, and then you have to pay $3 for another....something that I have never seen before.But sadly, this is was the only positive for the restaurant.  I had a #1 and the person I was eating with had flat enchiladas.  If this is the best Phoenix has to offer, I feel bad for anyone living here.  The food lacked flavor, the green chili sauce tasted like they opened a can and poured it on top.  Beans and rice were not good at all.The sopapillas were good, but that is not hard to mess up.Also way overpriced for what you get. Do yourself a favor, and find another restaurant.  Not worth your time.~~#~0
The manager is rude, my order is never correct, it really isn't hard to leave ice out of a drink people, the machine does it for you if you ring it up correct! 2 out of 3 times my kids food is wrong. I now avoid this location!~~#~0
Food aside, I was having a conversation with the bar tender talking to him about his old country and I asked, have you ever been to Israel?(Not that strange of a question for a middle eastern restaurant)To which I get the reply, achh those people are so cheap.I ask, which people?He says, you know .. the Jews.I haven't taken my business back since.~~#~0
I have never written a review on Yelp before, but my experience at Fuchsia was disappointing enough to make me get myself an account. When my husband scheduled a facial for me at Fuchsia for Mother's Day, I had been looking forward to it all week. The spa was running a special of a facial for $49. My impression is that the owners pride themselves on the affordability and accessibility of their spa...unfortunately, sometimes there is a reason we pay more: for better quality! Despite the aesthetician having a very sweet personality, this was NOT the facial I was looking forward to. I'll base my review around Fuchsia's website's (fuchsiaspa.com) claims. In describing their facial, the website boasts it will "properly and perfectly cleanse your skin from all makeup." In the bathroom mirror immediately after my facial, I could see that I still had mascara smudges under my eyes. Not to mention that because the aesthetician didn't wash her hands before massaging my head, I had super greasy hair and felt like I just wanted to go home and take a shower! The website also claims the facial will include "extractions if needed and desired." FALSE. Having extraction done was the main reason I got this facial, but when I expressed this to the aesthetician at the beginning of the facial, she said something to the effect of "I'll see what I can do." Toward the end of the facial when she still hadn't done any extractions and I was getting the sense that she was wrapping up, I asked her about it again. She told me that my particular blemishes are called millia and that they "aren't allowed" to extract them. She also said that everything was "too deep" to extract. She said I would have to do exfoliation on my own for two months before they could come out. Nonsense--I have had facials before and no one has ever had a problem extracting millia or anything else on my skin, especially because they "weren't allowed!" When my husband later called the spa to express our disappointment with this particular aspect of the facial, the manager said they have chosen a license that does not allow them to do these kinds of extraction because they could draw blood. So let the buyer beware: do not expect extractions and do not expect your aesthetician to tell you this directly at the beginning of your facial. Next, let's examine the website's claim that after the facial you will be given the opportunity to "browse the loot specifically chosen by your aesthetician for your one-of-a-kind skin at checkout." Well, that's certainly accurate! My facial ended with an attempt to sell me products from the store (which I've experienced before, no huge deal.) But far more annoying was that from the moment I arrived at Fuchsia, I was inundated with repeated offers of their $59/month membership by everyone from the girl at the check-in desk to the aesthetician to the manager to the check-in paperwork. Does YOUR relaxing spa experience include being upsold at every turn? No, mine doesn't either. As for the spa environment, it also was nothing special--the seating area is quite small and their treatment rooms and hallway are decorated with Ikea prints. I realize I can only speak from one experience, but all in all, it was extremely disappointing and I would not recommend Fuchsia, especially for a facial.~~#~0
The sign for the $65. detailing was read wrong by me. But TRACY should have corrected me when I said is that for the inside and out, TRACY said yes. I had said to her good because I just had a new spoiler put on and I have been wanting to get the outside detailed I also mentioned maybe I would just get the outside today and come back for the inside because I was running late , but then decided  to have it done. I just dont understand how they run a business misleading me, .I am 79 years old  with a fixed income . I called the next because TRACY had left for the night . She was not very nice, I told her I was going to the BBB ,  TRACY  answered  with she would take a picture of the sign she also had her employee to back her up.~~#~0
I hardly ever write a bad review, but I feel so compelled to warn anyone who is looking for a great dinner to not waste their money here! There are so many better options in Phoenix.  We went a couple weekends ago, had a reservation and had read great things about the place.  This place has SUCH potential for a home run considering the wine selection, menu and most importantly the location on the farm. We got there right at our reservation time and were greeted.  The hostess let us know that it would be about 10-15 minutes and directed us into the restaurant to the 'wine bar'.  This is when we began to wish there was an instruction guide to this place...it was not clear where to go for the wine bar and when we finally found someone to ask, she brought us a wine list and had us stand right smack in the middle of the dining room to look over the list. After we ordered a bottle of wine, we went outside to sit and wait.  The wine was great and there was a fire outside. After about 15 more minutes we were seated.  The table was in a weird spot right next to a door that wait staff were coming in and out of constantly. In the restaurant, the atmosphere was odd...I don't know exactly how to explain it.  It was quiet, but almost too quiet, like awkwardly quiet.  We saw wait staff walking about and helping customers and after 10 minutes we were still waiting for someone to come to our table.  I finally go the attention of the hostess and she apologized and sent someone over.  He was friendly but kept forgetting to bring water, we got the bread about half way through the meal, and he took about 20 minutes to get our check.  The food was decent, but compared to places like Kai, T.Cooks, Binkleys, not at all worth the money.  They have this plate with salted meats, cheese, etc. which is per person...so for the 2 of us it was $30.  Seriously! For that price, go to Cheuvront's or Postino's! If this was more reasonably priced, I might give it a second chance, but when you are going to spend over $200 for a meal, I'd rather go with a sure thing.  It was a really negative experience overall and the next night we did go to Cheuvront's to make up for it!~~#~0
This place sucks!! I am from Chicago just recently sentenced to the valley, but I will tell you what, the food at this place is as authentic as a three dollar bill!! I mean they were rude, unfriendly, and their food reflected there attitude..it sucked! Owners let me tell you something just because you order a sign that say's "Chicago style" and hang it outside doesn't mean that it is and you may be able to trick your Phoenix natives but true chicago folk should know the difference. The reality is that if you were on Clark st. Competing for business you'd last about 10 minutes before you went dark. Your food is bland and nasty. Your employees seem like extras from the movie "coma" and look like they could use an FMLA day, and your place is unkempt and dirty. I pray that a white castle opens nearby and steals your handful of customers, it would not be hard. Next time I will take video of the place and the food as well as the staff and their attitude and post it on you tube for those who have any doubt. Finally, try using real Vienna giardinara peppers not your own creation because your way off. By the way, I will post a link to view your county health inspection for all to see!! Have a windy city day buckaroo.~~#~0
If I could leave zero stars, I would.  Came here with a large group of 40+ for a dinner that was arranged with the restaurant weeks in advance.  When we arrived, they were still clearly unprepared (one of the guys on staff seemed entirely put out that we were there).  Rather than taking everyone's drink orders, they served one table (4-6 people) at a time.  Took almost an hour for my table to get drinks, and after an hour and a half, my table left to go elsewhere to eat because they hadn't even TAKEN our food order yet.  Considering this was a Tuesday night and the restaurant had few customers, you would think they would do a frigging jig about a large party coming in with a guaranteed dollar amount to be spent per head (due to the prix fixe menu that was put together for our group when the reservation was made).  Instead, we left hungry and irritated.~~#~0
The seets are waaaay too smashed together. $125 pet fee is rape.  My dog is smaller than my purse. They sure aren't charging me that to carry on my purse!~~#~0
This Dunkin is terrible. Every time we have come here, they've messed up our orders, made the drinks wrong, given us things we did not order, and worst of all have been rude about it the entire time. I do not recommend coming here if you value your time.~~#~0
I traded in a gold cross about 3 months ago. With the store credit I was given I purchased another cross, only to find it on their website at a lower cost. I went back to the store, returned the purchased cross and asked for our old cross back. I was told it would take a few weeks to ship it, which I understood. After nearly 2 months of no contact from Kay Jewelers I was told that unfortunately they misplaced the cross and it was nowhere to be found. Upon further review I found that the local Kay Jeweler closed down (Norterra). I called another Kay Jewelers and was told that the cross was probably in the safe, then was told it was more than likely at the home office. Days later, the store called to inform me they could not find the cross and I would need to deal with the home office directly. Home office told me a variety of different excuses as to where the cross was. Finally, a voice mail was left stating that they were willing to give me $80 store credit for their mistake. After many face to face complaints Kay Jewelers agreed to give me exactly $110 store credit; however, I was not permitted to spend more than $110 and pay the difference. This made it nearly impossible to use the store credit because nothing in the store is valued at $110.  Every time we have spoken to Kay Jewelers, they've given us an attitude as if this situation is our fault.~~#~0
I am extremely annoyed with this location. I purchased some presents here for my wife. During checkout, they asked if my wife had a coupon account. I said yes, but not to put I under her account because I didn't want her receiving an email about what I purchased. What'd they do? They sent her an email with the full receipt!!  It completely ruined her Christmas morning "surprise" gift.~~#~0
I had lunch at the Scottsdale location this week.  I was carrying a Contigo water bottle.  The hostess who seated me asked what was in the water bottle.  DUH - water!  Odd- never had that happen before.   I was seated right away but it took 10-15 minutes for the person to take the order.  Food came out very quickly.  Chicken breast was lukewarm, tough and not very tasty.  KFC has better chicken for less money.  Waffle was ok but the maple syrup had no maple flavor.  Paid with a credit card and had to show a driver's license.  Odd again -- can't recall that happening in a long time.   There are many places to eat where the food is better and your water bottle is not treated with suspicion.  Skip this place~~#~0
My husband and I entered the Steaks R Us building and were suprised to see it empty.  The advertisement stated it was dine-in, but we were directed by the staff to order our meal at the front counter, even after I stated we wanted to dine-in.  The gentleman took our order and added a 18% tip onto the check for himself!  I did a quick math in my head and asked if he added a tip on the check for himself.  With a straight face he said, "We are supposed to add a tip on the check."  We had just ordered 2 Porterhouse steaks!!!!  He gave himself a over $11.00 tip for making us order our food at the counter!!!!BEWARE!!!~~#~0
I'm surprised this place doesn't have more lower rated reviews. We should have sat in the patio because couldn't see our menus or even our food indoors. Seemed every table was using their flashlight iPhone app. I complained on deaf ears. Chicken was dry, food presentation nice (if only we could see the food on the plates!) but lacked much else. Way overpriced for what you get (tiny servings). Best thing was the side of beans (amazing!). Next time will try the place across the street.~~#~0
Pappadeaux has been one of my family's favorite seafood restaurants in Phoenix for several years......until today!We just went for dinner fairly early to beat the Friday rush.  We ordered our drinks and appetizer, approximately 15 minutes later my beer showed up after I had to ask the waiter for it again.  That was the first disappointment but was actually the least disappointing!We ordered our food and were patiently waiting, we understand that the food does not arrive immediately.  20 minutes went by...then 30.  After about 40 minutes the waiter came out and let us know that he was sorry it was taking so long and that our food was coming right out.  After this extremely long wait our 22 month old son was at the end of his rope and was out of patience.  We told them that we had to have the food to go since it had been so long.The manager came out and apologized to us and offered us either a free desert or a gift certificate ($7 desert or $50 gift certificate...don't take the desert!).  We do appreciate the gift certificate, however the disappointment was not over.We got home to eat the food (travel time only about 15 minutes).  My fried oysters were cold and soggy, I assume they had been sitting on the counter for quite awhile before they packaged them up for us.  My son's kids shrimp meal ended up being only 4 shrimp in the box with no fries!  My wife was also not very happy with her fish, very bland and not satisfying.We are very disappointed that Pappadeaux's has sunk to this level, we used to love it in the past but will not be eating there again.  To whoever we end up giving the gift certificate to.....sorry!~~#~0
Felt like our group was on "Restaurant Stakeout" or we were being Punk'd!!!  Seriously, I kept looking around for cameras and mics... and wondered when Ashton or Willie would show up!  OUR GROUP HAS NEVER EXPERIENCED SERVICE LIKE THIS in HIGHER-END RESTAURANTS!!   We consider ourselves FOODIES we wine and dine physician's all the time!!!  So I have to say that our group knows a little something about an overall dining experience!!!!   Went there on a friend's recommendation and we were DISSAPPOINTED... to say the LEAST!!!  Waiter was completely unprofessional and absolutely DID NOT KNOW THE MENU (Server 101). He forgot some of our appetizers, a glass wine and dessert orders!!  He was so awful... the hostess kept helping him bus our table and she kept apologizing for everything... and she never did anything wrong... Other than bus tables!!  (Not something I like to see in a higher-end restaurant.)  The Manager came out to speak to us...not on our request, btw.  Guess someone must've overheard our table conversations.  He apologized and comped us our undelivered appetizer, wine and dessert...that was nice of him...Really?!?!   I didn't think we were supposed to get charged for meals or drinks we never received.  Oh, did I mention he never brought out our missing dessert... but gave us our bill instead!  Thanks for kicking us out!!  Then to make matters worse... the Chef showed up and apologized for the waiter and practically thru him under the bus...Another unprofessional move!!!  I was so upset after all of our experience up to that point.... That I didn't even want to bring up the really fishy bouillabaisse, average chicken and the awful braised short ribs (needed a steak knife for this one).  Oh, and their online menu on the day of dining is not the same as the one they give you there!  I understand changing menu, but if you are placing the menu online... why not keep up with the most current one!?!?!?!  NEVER AGAIN will we dine here and ALL OF MY FRIENDS WILL KNOW ABOUT THIS experience!!!!!!   Unfortunately for us, it wasn't just the server we were disappointed with.... our food, the Manager's response and the Chef/Owner's overall complete lack of professionalism... completed the AWFUL dining experience.   I really wished the online reviews had met our expectations... but our whole group was completely disappointed with our overall service and meal experience!!!  We were all really hoping that we'd be stopped on our way out the door to let us know that we were being filmed for a "How Not To Treat Your Customer" TV episode, because it sure felt like one!!!~~#~0
Anyone who gave this place above two stars does not have taste buds. I know Indian food I grew up in Asia. Indian food is one of my favorite cuisines.  I went to the buffet. I received bland, room temperature food  with undercooked meats.  There are good indian food restaurants in Arizona this place is just not one of them. Go to The Dhaba which is just up the street~~#~0
I have never been here before and wanted to check it out. We walked in and the place was absolutely filthy. Every table that we walked up to was dirty...not just a little...i mean there was trash on the tables, ketchup, drinks spilled on the floor. It looked like there was a food fight.  There were about 5 employees behind the counter playing around and when I asked if someone could please clean a table I was told that there should be a clean one somewhere.Ok...see ya !!~~#~0
Went here with my wife and teenage son on Friday, 7-6-12. I Have not been to this chain since I was a teenager. We arrived at about  7:15PM, finding the parking lot almost full (usually a good sign). We checked in with the hostess and were told we would be seated in a few minutes. Shortly thereafter we were seated at a table in  the main thoroughfare. Not a huge problem, but things got worse from there. Our server was prompt and our drinks came quickly. We all ordered our meals with the minestrone soup. We were offered bread and it was nice and hot. The server told us on two occasions that they ran out of soup, but more was on the way and offered us a salad instead (should have taken her up on that offer). The meals came and still no soup. We were offered more bread and then were told they ran out of that too. I had spaghetti with meat sauce and my wife and son had chicken Parmesan. We all felt the spaghetti was tasteless and the chicken was rubbery. The soup finally came after we were done with our meals and in our opinion was inedible. All in all a very disappointing meal. The prices here a similar to most Italian chain restaurants. I personally will never go to this chain again~~#~0
Well, I guess I suck, but I can't figure out why anyone would eat here when Tasty Kabob is right up the street. In fact, I can't figure out why anyone would eat here, period.Went for lunch. Crowded; we got one of the last tables. Good sign, right? My response to that is always, "McDonald's is always crowded, too."The wall next to my head was covered in former customers' meal splatter. Experience tells me that if the dining area and bathrooms aren't clean, the kitchen is 10 times worse. I forged ahead, undaunted.The food came, and things got worse. Overcooked kabobs so dry, I could not work up enough saliva to break down the proteins. Had to swallow large hunks of meat. Bland, oily hummus and baba gannoush. Iceberg lettuce drowning in dressing. The only edible item was a gyro. Service was glum and perfunctory. I'm convinced the main reason people eat here, as with Mickey Dee's, is the price point. $3.29 for a hearty gyro is pretty astonishing. But I'd rather save my pennies so I can go to a place with clean walls and appetizing dishes.~~#~0
Yeah, don't even eat here.I didn't, so why am I reviewing this place? Simply because upon inquiring about whether or not they use the highly unhealthy (and some would say toxic, or even a chronic poison) hydrogenated oils in their donuts, the answer was "yes."Krispy Kreme and Dunkin Donuts do this, as well, but there's no pretense at those places. Lamar's not only charges premium prices for the sub-par trans-fat riddled doughnuts they carry, but they even lie on their website, claiming: "Our recipes have remained unchanged since 1933." Sorry, folks, but I can guarantee there weren't hydrogenated oils in much of anything in the 1930s.Might as well just go to the nearest KK, DD, or QT if you're gonna eat that kind of crap; at least you'll be paying a more appropriate price for it.EDIT: I have been informed, by one courteous fellow Yelpster, that hydrogenated oils originated in the 1900s. With a bit of study, I found that Crisco, which is composed of hydro-oils, was in use in the 20s. So, perhaps they didn't lie about the recipes. However, the points about the dangers of hydrogenated oils and their ridiculous prices still stand, so *you* should "stand" on the outside of their establishment.~~#~0
I was so excited to go to a local Italian restaurant, but I was EXTREMELY disappointed. I ordered the Chicken Marsala. It was tasteless, salty, the chicken was salty and there was about 3 1/2 slices of mushrooms. The sauce tasted like cheap white wine and  1lb of salt. The server dropped if off and didn't come back for 15min. After I told her it was inedible, she asked if I wanted anything else and I said no. She brought the check and it was still on the bill! She then told me since there was nothing wrong with it she could not take it off the bill. I asked to speak to the manager, she went to get him, then I saw her crumble up the bill and then she dropped it off with out the dish. I would not recommend this place to anyone. The best part of the meal was the Andy's mint at the end.~~#~0
Wow...We all know Denny's is not known to be the best, however this location is terrible. Its a real shame to because it wasn't always this bad. Its right near my house and a fairly new location. Every time I go there it gets a little worse but lets focus on my most recent visit there...We get seated by a server who redefines the word incompetent. She takes forever to take our drink orders, then walks by and asks if our food order has been taken. Shouldn't you know? You're the waiter. Then she takes the order then returns with my drink, a cup of coffee. The cup I got looked like the last person who drank out of it was a cheap call girl that applied way too much lip stick, Denny's decided it was too complicated to wash the cup so served my drink in it. Dirty tables, covered in debris was also a nice plus.I was not offered anything when I advised staff about this. All I got was a forced I'm sorry.........I will not be back.~~#~0
We were recently in Scottsdale to celebrate my wife's 50th birthday which happened to fall on Sunday, the 16th. We were with another couple who always said this was the best Sunday brunch in America, (better than the Broadmoor Hotel in Colorado Springs and others). We were excited about the birthday as well as the highly recommended brunch.Unfortunately, upon arrival, things went bad and never improved. We were seated at an outdoor table with a good view (one of the few positives), however, a circular pool of vomit was adjacent to one of our chairs. We had to ask for someone to come and clean it up. Instead of "I'm terribly sorry, let me seat you at another table," we just had to stand around the area and wait almost 10 minutes for the clean up to be completed.During the delay, I decided to explore the buffet and what was being offered to make it so expensive. I started at the first area (inside) and was greeted by the stifling smell of rotten fish. Perhaps, that was what made the last person so sick. Moving quickly past to the row of food items arranged outside (where the air was fresh), I asked to see the lamb chops and beef tenderloin, both of which were cooked beyond "well done." Even the prime rib was overcooked and dry. The cooked meats appeared just right for my in-laws from Oklahoma, but out of the question for anyone who typically orders medium-rare. French toast and other egg items appeared to have been pre-cooked, certainly not to order. The only edible item was the fresh tacos being made to order by an old Mexican woman.I returned to our table after the vomit was cleaned up, decided not to order the buffet and asked the waiter for a menu. My wife and the other couple opted for the buffet (against my recommendation). I waited at least 10 more minutes for the menu to come and the waiter disappeared again. Finally, I ordered a simple bacon cheeseburger and fries for which, again, I had to wait almost 25 minutes. I guess I was being punished for not ordering the overpriced, overcooked buffet!After we were through and left, I asked my wife how the tacos were (the ONLY thing she got from the buffet that she could eat). She said "fine, but hardly worth the price." I'm glad the other couple picked up the check as this was simply HORRIBLE food and a big disappointment! Do yourself a favor and skip the Sunday brunch at Rita's Cafe - no matter what people tell you.~~#~0
Not coming here again.... here's why: 1) hour and a half wait for pizza that tastes like Sbarro. 2) Grotesquely overpriced 3)  Stray cats roaming around everywhere outside the restaurant.   Gross.~~#~0
I received a coupon for joining the Corleones V.I.P. Club and another for my birthday for one free small sandwich. I usually go to the 16th st and Camelback one, but since they opened this one its closer to my house.I brought the coupon into the store and the guy behind the register stated it was expired. I didn't see the expiration and told them it was my fault, no big deal.I went home and printed my other free sandwich coupon and proceeded to call the Corleones and place my order for pick up. This is 20 minutes later, and I call in my order and the owner gets on the phone, has an attitude that I'm the same person and that he threw out my Philly cheese steak a few minutes earlier. The owner inquires about "what other, coupon" I have, with an abrasive tone, indicating I made one up. At this time I am very appalled that the owner of Corleones is actually talking to me like this and immediately ask, "is this how you treat all your customers," then proceeds to tell me he doesn't need my business, and hangs up the phone.Frankly this is a pathetic way to treat a long times Corleones customer, to say the least, I will not be recommending this place to anyone based on such horrible customer service by the owner himself and will be taking my business back to the 16th st and Camelback Corleones. Obviously this translates down to his employees and they will most likely see it OK to treat people like crap.This owner thinks he's too good to be cookin on the hot grill and servin Philly cheese steaks....c'mon buddy?~~#~0
I actually was surprised people gave this place more than 2 stars. Actually, I'm glad, though. Because if I see you actually gave this place more than 2 stars, I know  NOT to read your reviews anywhere else as you have lost all credibility. I was actually trying to figure out how to put no stars. Luckily for Stingray, I'm giving you ONE star. I thnk the owner atleast owes me a side of edamame for being generous. This place is one of the most overrated restaurants in Scottsdale. I've, unfortunately, been here a couple times. I've never had good sushi. The rice is hard, the rolls are bland, and the sashimi isn't even fresh. I made the mistake of bringing my out of town friends to this place, and they were all disappointed with the food.  Kyoto, which is up the road, is a lot better and cheaper. The waitresses are one can short of a six pack. The bar scene is Scottsdale at its worst. I always wonder why this place has 3 hostesses? I guess it takes 3 of them to do one person's job. This place is garbage.~~#~0
There is a reason countries like China are rising up. Because we're electing idiots like Jan Brewer. I mean, who cares if she was left as the caretaker Governor, but to re-elect her? One of our state's biggest blunder.Her victory speech included bashing on the president and threatening to challenge the federal government. Hey, why not secede from the union at the same time? We're already allowing some highly unconstitutional stuff, like SB 1070. It wouldn't be too far fetched to think that Brewer might actually one day propose this insane idea. Pretty much the whole state wasn't against SB 1070, yet here we are, we voted her back in.Then we go and vote in other republicans along with her. Great.~~#~0
Despite the friendly and welcoming front desk staff, I definitely wouldn't stay here again. I am usually in love with the personal feel of boutique hotels, but this one is lacking in too many areas for me. I should mention that I would come here again for their yummy cocktails and cool rooftop bar, but I will stay somewhere else overnight. Main complaints: The noise level is insane and constant, and this is coming from a youngish person who enjoys partying. But after, say 1 a.m., I'm ready to wrap it up, and the noise level from the pool (which all the rooms surround) is crazy loud--loud music (provided by the hotel) and loud drunk people all night long. During the day -- screaming kids at the pool and kids running rampant down the hallways. The walls in the room must be paper thin. I could hear not only the 24/7 party scene, but also heard every time my neighbor flushed the toilet or turned on the water. The rooms are pretty stark and feel old. And there is absolutely no counter space in the bathroom, which is awful when you're a girl and are traveling and you have to put your crap somewhere. There is also only one tiny mirror in the room -- the one in the bathroom. Girls will get why this is annoying. There were no amenities at this hotel. No room service, no snack bar (they say there is one included with your resort fee, but I had only two bottles of water in my fridge), no movie channels, no valet (which would be helpful when free parking is across the street) -- nothing that made it feel like a treat to stay here. I may as well stay at Hotel 6. The air conditioning sounds like a freight train. And the WiFi you also pay for in your resort fee only worked sometimes and sparsely for me. I had to go to a Starbucks to get work done because their Internet sucked so badly. So, yeah, this place isn't worth the price at all, which is disappointing because it seemed to have so much potential!~~#~0
I have had way better sea food at the Red Lobster and the price was nice.  Seriously,  my baked stuffed shrimp was overcooked.  My husbands Halibut didn't seem like halibut at all.  It was dry but edible.  Our third party had Lobster and clams and he thought it was terrible.  We are from Seattle and I guess we know sea food. Rich food does not mean good food.  The turtle soup was good.  The staff was friendly.  Not a reason to waste 200.00 bucks on a bad dinner.~~#~0
to start with i went with my boyfriend at 330 on 9/10/11. there were only 5 tables of people there including us. after sitting down i realized the cushion was covered in chip crumbs and lettuce, clearly they had not been wiped off. after ordering the server Joe D didnt ask if i needed a straw or lemon for my water. then my boyfriend had to wait 10 minutes to get a refill on his pepsi. when i looked around i saw Joe D standing at the bar slurping from his drink while talking to the guy behind the bar. The table next to me were served burnt chips. when we got the food my chicken was dry. this place sucks! i had been there before about 10 years ago and it was great back then. lastly this company has no comment cards anywhere in the restaurant nor do they have a way to contact the restaurant or make complaints through the website. they must not care about their customers as much as they use to. i do not recommend. if you are looking for mexican there are better places in the central/biltmore area. the only good thing was the red sauce on the chimi but not enough to get me back.~~#~0
-1 for the handful of gnats hovering above our table -1 for the dingy smell inside the restaurant-1 for the dirty cloth napkins-2 for the awful tasting tacos ("lobster" and chorizo con pappas)* -1 for the practically virgin banana colada* lobster is in quotes because i highly doubt it was real lobster. it tasted more like what imitation krab is to real crab. oddly crunchy, chewy and trasparent. i would've left if i were on my own, but i was with two friends that wanted to try it out and we had a groupon. personally, i never plan on setting foot in this place again. i want to gag just thinking about it!~~#~0
the food was alright, but the if you want to be annoyed the whole time while eating by the loud TV, and loud music playing on the other room from some kids trying to learn how to dance than go here.  every time i went it just gets worst and worst, one night the girls that were rehearsing on the other room played the same song over and over and over again, i think the whole time me and my family were there thats all they kept playing.  we asked the waiter to do something about it but he says he can't cause they're rehearsing.  so me having a smart mouth said, well than i guess u just lost some customers than.  only if they had a sound proof door separating the dance floor and the dinning room than it would be a good place.~~#~0
Thought we would check it out since it had received a few good reviews. I won't be back.No bathrooms...Have to go over to Subway for that. Not a big deal to me that it is a dive in a nice area or no bathrooms. Food is what is important...right?  Found meat on our food to be tough and burnt. Not tasty. Dry too. Won't be back. I can get a better meal at Ramiros or Filibertos just a short distance. Found it pricey too compared to competition.~~#~0
We had dinner on a Friday night at around 8:00. The place cleared out by 8:30 and we felt seriously rushed by the staff to finishing our dinner and drinks. Pretty early for this on a weekend night; guess they had places to go.As far as the food is concerned, for an "Italian" restaurant, it was just mediocre; the pizza crust was dry, sauce was OK; the  chicken piccata wasn't bad but also not great. We were looking forward to an excellent meal, especially the pizza, considering this is owned by Tomaso, but were obviously disappointed. Not worth the time,  money, or calories! There are so many better Italian restaurants in town, so we won't be back to this one.~~#~0
Totally disappointed on so many levels with this place.  I went there last night  excited to finally try the place since I drive past it on my way to and from work everyday.  When it is all lit up at night it just seems so inviting.  I was meeting a friend to talk business and we arrived a bit before 830. My experience started off bad and just went downhill from there.  When we walked in all the booths were taken but none of the tables in the dining room nor the 2 tables along the back wall that each seat 6 but have the comfy booth seats on one side.  We asked to be seated there but was told they needed to keep them open in case a large party came in.  Seriously?   It was a Wednesday night at 830, there would have been plenty of seating if a party larger than our meager 2 top came in.  Strike 1.Next our server Lissa did come by quickly to ask if we wanted to order, we asked for a few minutes.  I also asked what the soup of the day was, butternut squash, mmmmm! Those few minutes turned into more than a few and another server asked if we needed anything and ended up taking our order.  I ordered the soup and tuna tartar.  Lissa then came back to the table to inform us that they were out of the soup of the day.  Strike 2.  I order a side of vegetables instead.Lissa refills my water glass, brownie points for that, but spills some not only on the table but my hand.  She doesn't apologize, clean it up, nothing, just walks away.  Strike 3.My companion gets the edamame, which were not bad but the bowl that they were served in had a serious chip on the rim.  It was bad enough to cut someone if you weren't careful.  Strike 4.My tuna tartar was pretty terrible, a few chunks of chewy fish that were somewhat grey in color hidden among some greens that had way to many capers which made it super salty,  I ate a little less than half of it because I was so hungry and didn't want to deal with sending it back.  Strike 5.Next up the sorry ass, poor excuse for a side of vegetables,  When Lissa set down in front of me this tiny dish with wilted spinach and 1 piece of squash that was quartered and 1 piece of zucchini that was quartered I couldn't believe it.  There was a layer of spinach water at the bottom and it tasted like it was seasoned with Mrs. Dash.  Again I ate it because I was starving but realizing that each bite basically cost me a dollar, it was 5 bucks. Strike 6.Not even done yet......At 9:30 Lissa asks us if we want anything else, my companion informs her that her boyfriend will be joining us in a few minutes to get some dinner.  We are informed that the kitchen is closed.  There were still people in the place and from what I gathered from the website the kitchen closes "when the party is over."  So now my companion is on Yelp trying to find another place to go meet him so he can eat,  Strike 7.She finds a place not far and is going to meet her man by 10 because we still had some business to discuss.  I said she could just go so he didn't have to wait but always the professional, she stayed so we could wrap up our meeting.At 945 some people walk in, are seated and given menus.  I ask the server that helped them, a very nice gentleman, if they were going to be eating because we were told the kitchen was closed.  He went and checked and apologized for the mix-up but the kitchen was still open.  Strike 8.  I wish that guy was our server because he was great. I also see him speak to Lissa, who glances at our table but she never comes over herself to apologize.  I think she was in a hurry to clock out.  Strike 9When Lissa brings us our bill, the soup that they were out of, was still on it.  When I point this out to her she states since I got the side of vegetables, which wasn't on the bill, she just left the soup in place of it.  First, from a management prospective, you have to keep track of everything that is served to figure out your food and production cost.  Second, it was just plain laziness to not correct the bill.  Strike 10.Furthermore the soup was 7 and the vegetables 5, a cost difference that I pointed out to her.  She said she would take care of it.  She brings back the bill and say, "Ok they took a dollar off."  Are you kidding me?!  You can't subtract 5 from 7?!  Strike 11.I am so done with this place at this point I leave a chintzy $5 tip, I really wanted to leave nothing, but the old school server in me wouldn't allow it.  I left feeling cheated out of $70 and will never go back.~~#~0
WTH?  My issue is about getting exactly what I paid for and asked for (Shellac). I went in and asked specifically for a Shellac manicure ($30) and proceeded to peruse the bottles of colors they had displayed on the wall near the front desk. I was then told there were more colors to choose from and was given several nail wheel color samples, some wheels were labelled "Shellac."   I chose a color from the Shellac wheel and we moved over to the chair to begin my manicure. When my previous polish (Shellac) was being removed, the manicurist kept asking me if my polish was a gel.  I told him several times it was not a gel and it was Shellac several times (Shellac is a hybrid gel/polish).  He then proceeded to remove the polish incorrectly, and filed it off which is damaging to the nail rather than soak it off with acetone, which is what you are supposed to do with Shellac. The manicurist,  Brandon, proceeded to give me a manicure with a different brand than what I had asked for (he gave me Gelaicous).  Why would they label a color wheel, "Shellac" and then switch it with a different product.  Yes, they are both 14 day polishes, but they are different products with some including myself favoring Shellac.  At the time, I didn't know much about Gelacious and thought I would give it a try. If I knew then what I know now, I would have stopped him from applying it. On the positive side, Brandon did a very good job of cutting cuticles and did so precisely and gently. He application of the polish was precise and it lasted for the full 14 days. The arm massage was somewhat painful but perhaps that's just me and someone else might like such a rigorous massage.  As another reviewer mentioned, the setup of Lillian's is nice and they seem very generous to their customers.  I observed them to give many customers gift bags as it was the holidays when I visited.  I didn't receive a gift bag, and I presume this is because the gifts were for regular customers only.The salon does accept appointments and you can drop in too if you like.~~#~0
This place... Oh, this place. Kids have fun and that's what really matters...The courses themselves were basically made by some handy man with some 2 x 4s, tape, outdoor carpeting, paint, and tons of black lights. It is thrown together cheaply and with little regard to the fun, trick shots that make mini golf fun. There are no windmills or anything else that putt putt is known for. Albeit there are one or two holes with a tunnel or loop... But they are so cheesy! In addition to the course being pure cheese, the people running it aren't paying much attention. There is no delay in start times so everyone is holding on top of each other. The front desk should pay attention to that rather than just take people's money. And they're not even very good at doing that. I paid and had to ask for our balls and an adult club. The gentleman gave me the third degree because he didn't remember me paying a mere few seconds before. He was friendly, but the lights were on & no one was home, you know? You also have various loitering of teenagers around the 9th hole. They were literally sitting on the course & the staff or their parents doesn't feel the need to make them move. Of course, the parents would have to be the ones to make them move because there were no other members of the staff anywhere to be found, except at the front desk. Too bad my daughter won another free game on the prize hole at the end because I really don't want to ever come back.~~#~0
Limited choices of breakfast.   And our orders came in cold. They seemed to run out of people to clean the tables.  My friend added that they always run out of coffee.  I mean, it is definitely not place to start your day but a place for emergency.~~#~0
I went here for lunch and ordered a Thai iced tea and the Duck salad. The duck was cooked rare and the salad was extremely spicy, contrary to the server's remarks. I ended up having to leave mid meal and throw up. It was and extremely unpleasant experience. I was so sick that I didn't even have a chance to speak up.~~#~0
I stayed at this hotel on 6-9-12 and had a very bad experience. I reserved 4 rooms on 5-14-12. When we arrived there were only 2 rooms reserved even though I had a confirmation number and was billed for 4 rooms. I spoke with Mike who was an assistant manager, he got us 2 more rooms and said he would look into the problem and call me when he figured out something. Mike called me about 20 minutes later and said he worked out a solution. He said there would be a $37 charge for amenities which I said was fine. About 15 minutes later I got a text from my credit card company saying there was a $172 transaction charged to my card from the hotel. I called Mike and asked him what was going on. He said it was a pending transaction for amenities and would not be charged if nothing was used or missing from the room. I told him I was already charged $37. He said he could not do anything with the charge until we checked out and closed the ticket. Now as for the rooms, one of the rooms would not cool properly and the shower rod and curtain was missing so one of us were moved to a different floor. The other 3 rooms a/c did not work very well. It was only 99 degrees that day so I am glad it did not get any warmer as the a/c would have been inadequate as we had them on max. The suites are a little larger than most suites which was nice. The full complimentary breakfast was nice also. The overall appearance of the hotel is dated and needs some work. I paid $89 per room and would not advise anyone to pay more than that for their 1 bedroom suite.Upon checkout we spoke with Dennis and told him of the previous charges and I asked him for a receipt showing that nothing was owed. He said he could not do that. I asked why he stated his system would not allow him to do so. I asked him if he could not give me a receipt I wanted the $172 charged to my card credited back, he said he could not do that either. I told him I wanted something showing that I had no balance with the hotel. He said he had no way of doing that. I said I wanted something because I not want to have to dispute charges with the credit card company. Mike said he could give me a copy of the screen off his computer system, at this point I said fine. I then asked for a manager and Dennis said he was an assistant manager. I then asked for the general managers name who Dennis gave me the name of Tom Silverman. When I got home I left message for Mr. Silverman and have yet to receive a call or email from him.This hotel did not meet my expectations. If you plan to stay there don't expect much.~~#~0
As far as I know, this place is still a scary but quiet local ghetto dive located next to a ghetto Circle K and a ghetto laundromat. I used to live in the area and had my car stolen twice from my apartment complex - on the nicest part of this block. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone but spanish-speaking or bilingual locals. I still stop at the Circle K once in awhile, but apart from having a cool dive bar name I think this tiny strip is worthless. I'm almost scared to give this place a 1 star review - like the bar is going to come after me or something. Actually though, the people I remember hanging out at this place seemed pretty nice and low-key... just hard working folks trying to get a beer. Really, I just wanted to add this business and not review it - but that wasn't an option.~~#~0
The wife and I stopped in on Saturday afternoon for a mid-afternoon lunch and cocktail.  The server, Joe, took forever to get to out table.  when he did, he hitched up his leg and "scratched the inside of his thigh."  while talking to us.My wife ordered a wine that took 25 minutes to arrive (after we flagged down our server).  Lunch took 45 minutes to show up. We were actually standing up to leave when the server came around the corner with our food.My wife ordered a veggie sandwich with sweet potato fries.  The sandwich had turkey so it had to be remade.  This time, there was no lettuce or the spicy mustard ordered.  When we asked our server, he returned with raspberry dressing. This was pointed out and he finally returned with the correct mustard.  By this time, the croissant was a greasy, sloppy mess.I ordered the french dip which was OK, but the beef was cold and dry which leads me to believe it was made first then sat and sat and sat...  the potatoes in the potato salad had good consistency, but instead of a creamy mix, it was little potatoes swimming in a cream based sauce.  Not sure if this was correct, but ...The comment card in our bill folder was even pre-filled.  I flipped it over and wrote my thought for them there too.  I hope this place gets its act together.Also, the staff should stop worrying about how they look and worry about the guests.~~#~0
The place I tried was on union hills, absolutely terrible..pizza was over done, wings were bad and I felt like a fool spending $30.00 there for a terrible product.~~#~0
We came to The Thirsty Lion for lunch, and had a lackluster waiter. We had to ask for limes 4 times before he finally remembered, and he never once asked of we needed refills. My Father in Law ordered tomato basil soup that came out luke warm, my daughter ordered mac and cheese that came with super old and dried out celery and carrots on the side. I ordered the Kobe Beef hamburger medium. It came out raw in the middle and super salty! Needless to say, we were very disappointed!!~~#~0
This store needs to get with the 21st century. No online ability to take money. Won't take credit cards over the phone. Won't take American Express. Cutting themselves out of a big market.For local purchases with better customer service and convenience I prefer Tempe Camera Repair. They at least choose to accomodate customers.Don't know how this store stays in business.~~#~0
nice design...they forgot the quality food....~~#~0
I've tried so many of the local Mongolian BBQ places, and though this is the best of the bunch, that's not saying much.  BDs that was in Tempe back awhile ago was the only one I'd go to regularly.  The food choices here are decent, but the service sucks, it smells like urine and BO covered by pine-sol, and they cram too many tables in for it to be pleasant.  The floor literally pulled my shoe off of my foot it was so sticky.  Gross.~~#~0
I miss CHUY's on Sunday afternoon..... So, we tried the new digs at La Fonda.Just maybe there was a Make your own Bloody Mary special (nope).. ok, new design, looked a LOT more formal and more like a restaurant than a bar.. We sat at the bar to test the food and have a couple drinks.I got an Amber Dos Equis .... Clean, cold glass oh yea.... but then the after taste had a strong metallic hint to it.Got Sampler appetizer, BEEF.. Taco, Taquito, Chimi... all 3 the meat was short on flavors, had to scoop in the salsa to get something going on.. Chimi didnt have that chimi crunch. .. one of the bartenders that came on shift while we were there did nothing but complain about her scheduled hours and being asked to come in to other customers... :-( Will not be back, cant get shredded beef right, why try anything else..++ the chips were good, salsa  eh,,,~~#~0
I feel bad for the low rating b/c the lady who works the drive thru late nights has been there since my hubby & I were in HS & she is super sweet but ugh, I GOT FOOD POISONING HERE! It was 1am Christmas day, or the day after if you wanna get technical, and we were all hungry after some drinking & other 'festivities". Jack in the crack is 1 of the only places by us open 24 hours, so the boys went on a food run. That morning at about 5am I got so sick. I thought maybe it was the alcohol but I only had 2 glasses of wine & 1 glass of champagne, nothing crazy. When I couldn't stop throwing up that entire day, had the chills & body aches, my husband said it had to be food poisoning. I will never eat here again, or at least for a long time, no matter how hungry at 1am I am. All the pain I was in was not worth it!~~#~0
They gone.  Corporate website doesn't even list Arizona anymore.  Too bad.~~#~0
Worst Applebee's every. Took 10 min for someone to get my water. Placed my order and when they brought my oriental chicken salad the chicken was hard and dried out, a drizzle of dressing. My soup bowl was completely cracked, so then I couldn't eat anymore, lost my appetite. Guy asked me once how I was doing, and didn't even give me a chance to talk. Never again!!!!~~#~0
I am livid as I write this. I rarely eat at McD's, but I do stop in for a McRib when it is offered. That was our reason for going this time. Our order was 1 Mcrib, 1 Qtr Pounder, 1 Big Mac, 1 side salad, 1 drink, 1 fry. Five items and a drink.  When our bags came through the drive thru window, we did a cursory check and had 5 items in the bag in a quick, efficient manner. When we got home - we had 1 Qtr Pounder, 2 Big Macs, 1 fry, 1 salad and drink. Yeah, it is five items + drink. Not the CORRECT five items. I drove back with 2 big macs, receipt and bagging list (both of which listed mcrib and 1 big mac). I went inside and spoke with the employee there. I said I would like to return the 2 big macs in exchange for a new big mac and a mcrib. He turned around and had the cook make a new mcrib, which he promptly handed to me and said I could keep the other 2 big macs. WTF? How much more plain can I make it? I want a FRESH big mac AND a mcrib, not TWO bigmacs that are now half an hour old (they will be by the time I drive back home). I didn't even bother to argue the point. Why? The store is equipped with thousands upon thousands of dollars in equipment designed to take orders, cook orders, and track orders. The whole process happens in an area 500 square feet. But somehow, even with all of this high-tech equipment tracking your order from start to finish; something as simple as getting FIVE items in a bag correctly is beyond the capability of the multiple staff members that is preparing/checking and serving that order in those 500 square feet. I came home -  and ate a bit of my mcrib. I didn't eat the big macs as they were cold, and who wants to reheat burgers laden with lettuce and special sauce? That's just gross. It could have been a nice treat, but instead I had to log onto the internet and spend what could have been dinner time letting you all know that things like caveat emptor still apply, especially at drive thru windows. Cursory item counts aren't enough.. you have to VERIFY what each item is. I'm paying good money for simple items which are tracked by complex systems and multiple personnel yet somehow such a seemingly simple task can go wrong in the matter of a few feet. I just don't get it. Thanks for nothing, McDonald's.~~#~0
It used to be a cool place to go and look for awhile and find something really cool! Like a new top or a cute dress. I don't know what happened. Now it's just sad. Probably better to not waste your time. Maybe go to Ross instead.~~#~0
Listen, the place is kitschy, silly and if you are into seriously tacky Mexican reproduced goods this is your mecca. Unfortunately for the owners,I will not support bad customer service. Bitter, bitter, very unattractive couple works the register.I will not go back. I say, check out Buffalo Bills just down the road!~~#~0
Came in to use a Groupon, really should have followed my gut and let the Groupon expire and reuse the money.The food was ok; too many onions in the Tom Kai soup, Phad Thai - ok.  The service makes you really wonder if this place wants to be in business.  I arrive and GONGED my arrival, several times, as per the signage.  After 5 minutes, wandered around and found a staff member back in the kitchen.  Was seated, only person in the restaurant.Looking at the menu tells the story, everything starts at about $9 - apps, soup, salad, noodles, entrees - and goes up from there.  This is a bit expensive for a restaurant in the back corner of a "Smart and Final" strip mall.Service was intrusive and confusing.  I was waited on by a server, mgr/owner, and the cook - nobody seemed to be able to communicate with the other.  As stated, I was the only one in the restaurant.  The fourth game of the World Series was on, Top of the first.  The mgr/owner changed it to a football game and left.  I requested it be put back to the baseball game, but the mgr/owner left with the controller.  "I HAVE CONTROL, I HAVE THE REMOTE!!"  After my server came by, stopped at the table, interrupted me mid-bite - pushing a shopping cart from Smart and Final (WTF), to tell me if I need a bathroom, they were in the back of the restaurant (WTF).  Decided it  was time to box up my meal and get the heck out of Dodge.Don't waste your time or money!!!~~#~0
When my fiance and I went to the Chandler Location on Ray Road to have my wedding band custom made, I was impressed my their knowledge of diamonds. However, after seeing their finished product, I was not impressed by their lack of attention to detail in making a simple eternity ring to compliment my engagement ring. When I went back to the store, without my fiance, to pick up the ring you could clearly tell with the naked eye the spacing between the diamonds wasn't right. I brought it to the attention of the lady that we bought it from. She told me that it was a custom piece, what did I expect?  She brought out the guy that made it and he told me he "wasn't an engineer". I left the store feeling bullied and taken advantage of. When my fiance returned from an overseas business trip we went back to this location and spoke with the manager. He agreed that the spacing was off and he would personally be in the store for the next 2 days to make sure the work was done right. We made it perfectly clear we were getting married on 3/9/12, he said no problem, the work would be done 3/7/12, after 5:00, we could pick it up then. My fiance just received a phone call from Jared (3/7/12 11:00am), they haven't started on the ring, they may need until this weekend to finish the work.  He called them back to let them know that was unacceptable, now they are rushing a job that should have taken 2 days to do.  At this point I have no confidence in Jared that the ring will be right.  I am not a review writer, but consider this warning before you do business with these guys.~~#~0
I got a MRSA infection in my toe after getting a pedicure here. The cute nails were not worth the pain and the expense from the MRSA.~~#~0
A Tourist trap that will "nickel and dime" you to death.Actually, the ghost town is cute & quaint - Just keep your hand on your wallet - Everything costs, and even the street performers are panhandling for "donations" with every chance they get.  The reptile display costs $2/person to see!Definately avoid the Mammoth Steakhouse (see a previous review of mine) - HORRIBLE food & service.If the whore house was for real, I can only imagine how much IT would cost!Geeze!~~#~0
Left my IPhone 2 hours told them I needed ALL my photos downloaded to iCloud and backed up.  None of my most important photos were downloaded and transferred to my new phone, none of ITune ringtones were transferred, had to re-load all my apps myself.  We opened 2 new lines with them.  NO SERVICE IN CAREFREE OR BOULDERS, PERIOD.  Wish I never left Verizon!~~#~0
Where do I begin?Long ago I remember "Tom's BBQ" at Alma School and Warner.  It was decent.  Until San Tan BBQ came to town it was my favorite.  (Then San Tan closed and I discovered Joe's!!)  Tom's long-since left the place I remember.  Well, we were in the area of Chandler Heights and Gilbert tonight and thought "why not?".  So we stopped in.  After all, Yelp showed 3 stars.When we entered the place was packed.  Good sign, I'm thinking.  We were seated promptly, and the waitress came by quickly.  She wasn't much for chatting, but she was friendly and professional.I ordered the pulled pork sandwich, my wife had the brisket sandwich.  We were very surprised how quickly the food came.  We both tried our beans first.  They were...OK.  Not really good, but not really bad either.  I removed the top bun because it seemed so small, but the meat was piled respectably thick.  Fine.  Put the bun back and take a bite.This is where it goes wrong.The meat was very tender.  That's about the best I can say about it.  The sauce was like a generic grocery store sauce.  Not bad, but not really good.  The meat seemed like it had been boiled, and then some sort of smoke flavor added.  It was nasty.  The "smoke" flavor was not right, and not good.  Almost like a burned flavor, but not quite that either.  The after-taste of that flavor lingered about an hour after we left.  (What is that?!)  Compare and contrast to either Dave's or Joe's (both of which are good, though Joe's is much better).My wife's brisket sandwich was no better.  Well, maybe a little better.  She said it also seemed like it had been boiled, but there was no smoke flavor at all (so she didn't have to deal with the after-taste like I did).  She was, however, a bit nauseated until after we got home.  I understand...my stomach felt like I had just had a Big Mac (that always leaves me a little queasy with the feeling of a rock in my stomach).It was further, but we should have gone to Liberty Market instead.  We thought about it, almost did it, but this was closer.  Bad choice.  Never again.~~#~0
Seriously, when is it going to be over?  That is what was going through my mind during my 60 minutes of torture.  I must have gotten the heavy breather that the other reviewer complained about. Not only did he breathe heavily, but he grunted a lot, and seemed to stumble over his own feet. It was the most odd, non-relaxing, and miserable "massage" experience I have ever had. It wasn't so much a massage as it was pinching, karate chopping (not even kidding), and holding hands with my feet.  Some things were bizarre, and borderline creepy:  picking up my legs and dropping them back onto the ottoman, pulling his fingers through my hair (curly hair with lotion on his hands), and the technique used to massage my thumb; it creeps me out thinking about it.  I don't know what I am going to tell my friend about my experience after she raved about this place; I'm embarrassed for her. I know typically you get what you pay for, but in this case it wasn't even massage worthy if it had been free! Since this was my first experience here, I will not be going back or recommend them.~~#~0
Noble Beast is a small store with limited products. They've got a ton of dog food but only a small wall of toys and a corner for bedding. If you're looking for pet food, chk out Pet Food Depot, if you're looking for dog toys/clothes/beds, chk out Petsmart. Overall, I don't recommend Noble Beast bcus I found nothing interesting and even if I did, it'd be overpriced. I would give this a half star if I could...and only bcus they have a parking lot.~~#~0
I miss Cafe Portobello!! Not the Cafe Portobello with the horrible ownership, the ORIGINAL Portobello. The one with the Flat Iron Steak and Chipotle mashed potatoes...OH I MISS IT. It's tragic what has become of this location. They took a BEAUTIFUL layout with an open feel and nuetral decor and turned it into a dark, dreary place. The LAST thing we needed was ANOTHER sports bar. We have Zipps, Goldies and  Temple Bar. This location with it's amazing patio and breathtaking view desrves SO MUCH better. MMR deserves better. The staff is nice enough but the food and wine offerings completely random and dissapointing. Sorry but when we want to go to a "sports bar" this will be my last choice.~~#~0
Worst gym I've ever went to. The staff is always trying to sell you stuff and the equipment isn't maintained very well IMO. I cancelled my membership after 7 months and started going to 24 hour fitness up the road. I also had multiple problems with the billing because they always seemed to double charge on the kids club.~~#~0
Not so much anymore... Best bartender is gone. This place is lame.~~#~0
I love Yelp cause I can share my many experiences with you and the world. So today, in desperate need of a margarita, I decided to stop here with a couple of friends for a pitcher and some guacamole. After a few margaritas, I found their "healthy" menu and decided to order their  "vegan" veggie burrito. Problem was there was nothing vegan about it. After several bites of the burrito, I found a large piece of burnt steak inside. NASTY! If that wasn't enough, after consuming nearly half of the black beans it was served with, I found pieces of pork in the beans. That explains why they were so salty. I presented all of this to the manager who was kind enough to take most of everything, minus the booze, off of the bill. Revolting.~~#~0
I must say, My recent and probably final visit to this Frys store was the most fun Ive had since I got my wisdom teeth pulled. Actually the trip to the dentist was more rewarding and painless. There is a lady standing at the front of the entrance who's job is to hand out little fliers to everyone that basically says that If you find a better internet price,we will happily meet the price, What she doesn't tell you is that if you do such a thing, they will completely change their whole attitude with you, and treat you like a thieving low life mooch who is trying to steal all the money from their pockets. We found a TV, worked out a deal, arranged for financing and went home to get a truck. We fell on a deal for the exact model at Amazon for $89 less and free shipping. When we returned and notified our sales guy, David , You would have thought his entire world had crumbled beneath him, and I was taking his lunch money away. At that point, he shrugged and sulked, accessories where pulled from the package and I was told I may get audited by the IRS for buying from Amazon for tax fraud. The entire mood was changed from a happy one to one where I couldn't get out of there fast enough to keep from Losing It! What a JOKE!!! What do they expect to happen when they are daring you to find a lower price? Well, Im off to "Worst Buy", at least you know how they are.~~#~0
AWFUL AWFUL cellular service in AZ. I mjust switched from T mobile to At &T and BOT was that a stupid move. They are most unhelpful - I have dealt with them in the store, Customer service via phone and chat online and no one will help.... lousy phones lousy service. I have no texts for hours. I mget messages after a 2 hour to 24 hour delay. Ridicu;ous. If it is was not for IPHONE thises people would not be in buisness~~#~0
went for breakfast, cute but the food was awful. Honestly, Dennys serves better breakfast and I abhor chain restaurants. I really wanted this local place to be great. disappointed.~~#~0
Horrible.Even my 8 year old son said so upon his first bite.  Now I am literally forcing him to eat it because we have nothing else to eat in our hotel room.My 10 year old won't eat it either but he was quieter about it.If you like their pizza and are in the area, come and take our...PLEASE!Save your money~~#~0
Game Night, Suns v T'Wolves.  but its amateur night at the bar.  This place hires all the bar-tending class failures (is that even possible?).   I had to double check and made sure I'm not wearing my Army Camo's cuz it felt like they could not see me.  finally got a drink with lingering empty glass, not once I had a drink check, ordered a shot for my buddy that required several reminding's.  On top of that I was handed somebody else's bill.  WOW!I don't think this place deserve any Stars.  Snap!! I just realize that I too, as a man would be dis grunted if I have to wear a skirt to make living.~~#~0
I have to agree with the whoever posted above. I am sad to say that you guys were my favorite store in the Scottsdale area. I am from the east coast and unfortunately live in Tucson. I love clothes and always came to Amy Inc for everything. When friends from out of town came to visit, I would always take them to the store and trust me, my friends are big shoppers. UNTIL TODAY, I just called and got THE RUDEST lady on the phone ever. I wanted to order a kaftan for a trip I'm taking. She was rude and acted as if I was inconveniencing her. I asked if they had a style and she said no and told me to come in. I then told her I live in Tucson only to hear an annoyed reaction and a response of "well I don't know I guess I have to send you pictures but there's like 5 different styles." I mean really? I was ready to drop $600 on a kaftan and she's rude? I am almost positive it's the owner of the store as I know all the girls who work there and they're the sweetest people. NEVER EVER EVER AGAIN- and I will be sure to re-post this anywhere I can.~~#~0
I purchased an Earnhardt car in 1974 and I told myself, never again. Well here we are 2011 and I thought, let's give them another shot...somethings never change!!I went in for my first service on my new Hyundai Sonata and wanted to report that it was a terrible experience.First, I tried to book it online and told them I was going to wait.  Then I figured, I better call and see how long it was going to take.  I was shocked when they said 2 to 3 hours.  For a simple oil changeSo, we decided to re-book it for the following morning and brought the car in Tuesday afternoon (around 4:45PM) and they told me that they would have it finished the following morning and would pick me up with the shuttle the next morning.I get a call at 8:30 AM today that the car is finished.  They said the shuttle would pick me up leaving at 9 AM.  I got several callsfrom the driver saying he was running late.  He finally picked me up at around 10:30AM.I pay for the service and the receptionist tells me my car is outside somewhere and I should push my key until I hear the car----in other words it is somewhere in the lot.  I got out to get the car and it was filthy even though they said they would wash it.I went to the cashier/receptionist and said my car is not washed.  She told me to come back on Friday---two days later.  I said, really, why do I have to come back again?At first she made up an excuse like,  There was a storm last night.  I said, what does this have to do with my car not being washed today?  She then went on to tell me that they are re-paving the parking lot and the wash would not be turned on for two days.  Really?Talk about customer service.  If it was me, I would have washed the car by hand.  And that's what I did when I got home and was totally dissatisfied with theservice.  If I get this kind of hassle for a simple oil change, what can expect in future?I do not recommend them!!FYI, I WOULD HAVE GIVEN THEM NO STARS IF THAT WAS AN OPTION!Well, it only got worse... My fault, I loved my car hated the dealership and still let my husband buy his new car there after all this.  Well his salesperson Jack/Jacques seemed so nice, had a French background and with a husband from Brussels, it seemed great until he said, oh.. don't worry about that, I'll through it in. ....3 months later, he won't take our calls, no response from voice mails, so never will I have anyone I know buy any car from any Earnhardt dealership....They don't honor what they say, and they give even bad car dealers a bad name....   Think 10 times before buying anything from them!!~~#~0

I will not return to The Grapevine.  We went on a fairly busy Sunday afternoon and the staff was not up to the challenge.  The hostess disappeared for several minutes at a time, leaving many people wondering who to speak to, what to do, or whether they should seat themselves.  When we did get seated, the waitress was even more clueless.  She didn't show up for several minutes, then took a drink order and disappeared indefinitely.  Every time she did anything she was gone for an inordinate amount of time before returning.  This became especially annoying when she gave each of our party of three drink refills one at a time. When the food finally arrived, it was no longer warm, so whatever she had been doing she allowed our food to sit for awhile before she brought it.  Bottom line: the staff had no idea what they were doing and were extremely slow in doing anything.  I now see that this slow service runs through all the Yelp reviews.  Now the food: not horrible, but below average.  Definitely not worth the wait.  The menu spans lavosh, mexican, burgers and gyros.  Too broad a choice for most chefs, and this one was no different.  The chips and salsa were good, and the chips homemade, but that was the extent of it. The rest of the food was very mediocre and room temperature.  There are many good places in the Old Town Scottsdale area, and The Grapevine just doesn't measure up.  You can get better service and better food at many other places in that area.  (As a trivial aside, an example of how clueless the staff was is that on a Sunday afternoon, they had the bar TVs on bowling.  Yes, Bowling!!)~~#~0
My boyfriend is crying. Seriously. Not hyperbole.Okay, he's had a long day, but the awful pad thai and sweet-and-sour seafood curry just pushed him over the edge. I don't forgive places that hurt him. If I say I want this place to have an accident in a back alley, can that be used against me in court? There are half a dozen decent thai places in the area. There's no excuse to go to Thai E-San.~~#~0
Really not sure how to rate it since the service sucks so bad. Pretend it's a 1 1/2 star I guess.For the second time in a week I've received my Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger with no bacon. How does that happen?Other incidents have included but are probably not limited to: a mysteriously soggy bun, buns that were harder than they should have been, missing food and other various problems typically associated with these type of eateries.I know it's fast food but come on people. Get it together!Also keep an eye out for your straw as this Wendy's is notorious for giving you your drink and then giving you nothing to drink your drink with. I don't know why Wendy's insists on putting the straw in the bag since they more often than not forget to.If it weren't opened 24 hours and I wasn't such a gluten for punishment I'd never go here.Dave was cool, this Wendy's is not!~~#~0
I am usually overly generous with my stars, so I'm even shocking myself.  The one star is rated purely on the food.  If the view, great cocktails and cute waiter were taken into account, I could go up one or two more.I ordered the bento box and my lunch partner ordered an Asian noodle salad.  Both were sadly bland and nondescript. In fact, it's odd that we don't lick our plates clean, so it's saying something when we leave food.  Perhaps we ordered the wrong items?  But in my opinion there should be no wrong items on a menu.I did like their unique cocktails-mine a spicy concoction of citrus and heat...~~#~0
This is a bitter review.  The place doesn't really deserve 1 star, but I was asked to leave by a bouncer, and when I opened my mouth to protest, he grabbed me and escorted me to the door.  There is NO reason for a bouncer to get physically aggressive with a non-aggressive patron.  This guy was a meathead, and even seemed to have some roid rage if I'm not mistaken.  When are bars going to learn that by employing these types you lose business?  I would never go back there, and that means anytime I'm with my friends we will avoid the place.  DIPLOMACY is the name of the game in bouncing.  If you must kick someone out, do it in a discreet, non-confrontational way (unless the person was being violent to begin with, in which case feel free to put him in a half-nelson and toss him out the door)~~#~0
I was visiting family for my cousin's high school graduation and we ended up here as a group.  Before I visited I had read the previous Yelp reviewers and realized I was in for an overpriced, unappetizing disappointment.  Let's just say I was NOT let down on that.  Unfortunately, for those that are quick viewers due to the previous fake reviewers (those who have 1 or 2 reviews under their belt) have brought the stars value to 3 when in actuality it should be 1...maybe 2.*Service:Very, very poor.  The restaurant was perhaps 1/3 full and they were overstaffed as far as waiters go.  It was a 100+ degree day outside, and we had a group of 15.  The waitress could not figure out that we were parched and even when we asked her to bring water she only remembered half the time.  She checked in on our table rarely yet she had no other customers, basically to get drink orders, food orders, dessert orders, and to drop the check.*Food:+Baked Cheese-House cheese blend baked w/ a roasted tomato-habanero-chipolte sauce, topped w/ Grilled Chicken, Ham and Chorizo-served w/ fresh corn and flour tortillasIt was a skillet of cheese with random scatterings of cut ham, with what the table concluded was cinnamon in it.  It was basically, an overpriced sweet 1lb of cheese in a skillet.+Side dish-Black Beans with OrzoThe beans were hard as if they were not thoroughly cooked and very salty.+Grilled Salmon-Grilled farm raised fillet of salmon, served with a guajillo-pineapple sauce and pineapple salsaThank goodness I asked for the sauce on the side.  The salmon was a bit on the salty side for me, and the pineapple salsa was a bit sweet.  It could have been a good contrast, but it wasn't.  The sauce that I asked for on the side was super sugary.  The salmon dish was barely eatable w/o the sauce, but with it...I could only imagine the disaster.+Traditional Flan-Old-fashioned caramel flan served with mixed berry compoteWe asked for the compote on the side as we all just wanted the flan.  This was laughable.  Literally a couple of us laughed at the sorry, pitiful heap of flan on the plate.  Once again the chef must have tried for the sweet tart contrast again.  The flan was ever so sweet and the berries were quite tart.  Unfortunately, the chef missed the mark again!*Presentation:It all looked beautiful...the way the sauces and colors were presented on the plates.  Although, my cousin but it perfect when she said, "Mexican food is suppose to look sloppy and taste great.  This looks great and taste blech."Consensus at the table: thumbs down, not to be repeated or recommended except to enemies.~~#~0
Unless this place has changed recently I can not see anyone giving it five stars. I try this place every couple of years thinking that it will get better. The food looks fine and there is plenty of it. The problem is that I get sick almost every time I eat it. Nothing serious, just an upset stomach or the like. I have heard others mention the same reaction. I keep hoping that they will fix what ever it is, because it is cheap and plentiful.~~#~0
Not a very good place at all.  Be very careful of this place as they tack on all kinds of move-out charges.  They make you show a receipt that the apartment has been "professionally cleaned" when move out.  I had my neighbor clean the place as she did an exceptional job.  Because she is not a registered cleaning company, they charged me $130 for not having a registered company clean the apartment.  Also, make sure that you pay rent before the first of the month if it falls on a holiday.  They charged me $75 for not paying them on time because they were closed on the first of the month.  Because they decided to close on the first, they charged other tenants and I $75 for supposedly paying late.  Be very careful if you decide to live at this apartment complex.~~#~0
I really love the food here. I have never had anything from the menu that I did not enjoy. However, I will never return to this establishment after the way I was treated this evening.After finishing our meals, I gave my credit card to our server to pay our bill. Upon returning to our table and leaving the receipt for my signature, the server, as an afterthought, told me that she had accidentally charged another bill to my credit card. I was then told that the charge was for about $50.00 and that it would be credited back to my account in 2-3 business days. Needless to say I was not happy and asked to speak with the manager. Prior to getting to my conversation with the manager let me explain my thinking. Based on what the server told me, I was charged $50.00 by mistake and then was charged $67.73 for my bill. The server understood that the $50.00 (even with a credit authorization run) was going to show as pending on my account and would take up available funds or credit on my account. Rather than come tell me of the mistake that was made, the server put through the credit authorization and then charged my bill to the account. The server had no way of knowing if the funds would be available for both charges, but knew that for at least 2-3 business days both charges would take up funds or credit from my account. This means that in the event that this extra $50.00 put me over my credit limit or overdrew my account I would be left holding the bag, with the server never having thought to ask me if I could afford to be without the extra $50.00 for 2-3 days. Essentially my thinking is that the server's actions were a horrible way to handle the situation. I spoke with the manager and he was completely uncaring about the situation. He basically told me that it was only $50.00 and that I would get it back in 2-3 business days. He then proceeded to ask me if I had the $50.00 available and that if I did it was no big deal. I explained that even if I had the $50.00 I was now $50.00 poorer due to his company's action. He did not care.I then returned to my table and used my phone to check the charges on my account. It was not a $50.00, but a $76.47 charge. Both the server and manager lied about the amount that was incorrectly charged to my account. This upset me. I found the manager and explained the discrepancy in what I was told and the facts. Again the manager was not concerned. Basically the server and manager had lowered the incorrectly charged sum by more that 1/3. Then the purported owner of the establishment told me "this happens all the time and no one has ever been upset about it." You read that correctly, IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. This restaurant should not be trusted with your plastic. I am just thankful that it wasn't a $500.00 bill that was charged to my card. I will never again visit this place of business due to the way in which this situation was handled.~~#~0
I went into this location to find one small thing that any hardware store should have, suction cup hooks for windows.  I looked in the cavernous store for about 10 minutes then decided to ask someone who worked there. This is how it went:1st Sales Associate :      Should be over with hooks aisle 15 or Mill work. Then we walks away.2nd Sales Associate stocking on another isle:      Hmm it should be over here.  Yells to another Sales Associate at a desk in doors.  3rd Desk Associate: Informs us that they are nowhere near where we are, and are probably "somewhere" in the tile section.2nd SA : Head over to tile and ask someone over there they will be able to help you better.Walk over to the no man's land that is tile....  Guess what; no sales associate.  So I wonder around for a bit then give up and leave.I know they are a huge box store, but you would think with that many employees it would't take 20 minutes of kinda sort of trying to find something.  I guess if I spent more time in the Home Depot I would know where everything was.~~#~0
not even close to the flavor of rudys in austin,tx. ribs were tough,brisket was bland and way  overcooked. dropped 80 bucks at this location about a month and a half after they opened and will not be returning. i will wait till i visit the inlaws in texas to pick up some rudys bbq.~~#~0
You get what you pay for.  The food is inexpensive but taste that way.  The only thing good is the bean dip and salsa that you get at the beginning of the meal along with hot corn and flour chips.  The rest of the meal is bland.~~#~0
Wish I could give them zero stars. The other reviews are spot on. They don't want your business. They refuse to honor Subway coupons. The employees act rude and condescending. Their prices are more expensive than other Subways in the area. I'd recommend the Subway at 51st and Olive if you're looking to eat at Subway in this neighborhood. Avoid this one at all costs!~~#~0
Disappointing place.  Coin operated pool table were a disaster.  It was like playing a slot machine on whether it would take your money instead of giving you a game. When the money mechanism decided to work, the tables are so bad anyone who knows anything about playing pool would pass.  I am stuck playing on these tables for pool league.The games are $1.00 each and way over priced.  Bad rails, unlevel tables, and felt that feels and works about as well as the carpet on the floor.Do they think having shitty table for pool league goes unnoticed?  The idea of having pool league is to have more people spending more money.  Problem is who would spend money in a place that does not take care of their pool tables.  I had a free ice water and got out of there as soon as I finished my match.The only reason to go to D&E is if you have to!  Avoid it if you can.~~#~0
Places I DON"T shop:1. Places that make me check out my own groceries (like Fresh and Easy)2. Places that make me pay to shop there (Costco, Sam's Club)3. Places that make me bag my own groceries (Fresh and Easy and Winco)Give me a break. Whatever happened to customer service???I shopped this Fresh and Easy store once. When I found out that I had to check out my own groceries and bag them myself it became clear that they did not want my business.~~#~0

4 stars??? WTF? Ok, look, confession...I occasionally bet on sporting events and Phoenix is not really a sports-smart city. Or a smart city, for that matter. Sarver is easily the worst NBA owner. About the only thing he's done right in recent years was not resigning the immature, put-my-hand-through-an-extinguisher Amare Stoudemire.  And I think that was simply pure luck because Amare was looking for a hundred million, and there was NO WAY Sarver would unroll his wallet that far.I liked the team when they had Barkley and Dan Majerle, who put up a good fight against the Bulls in the 90's. But those days are long gone. Steve Nash should've been traded 2 years ago, the guy's 38 now! As if Phoenix needed any more old people.Compare the management of this team to the San Antonio Spurs. The Spurs are a small-market team whom have had incredible success due to their management. And if you don't believe me, look at the no-name players the Spurs sign, like Patty Mills. The Suns, on the other hand, are going nowhere fast with Robert Sarver and Lon Babby. Luckily, they have tons of dumb fans willing to spend big cash to watch them barely miss the playoffs. Oh well, looks like the Western Conference Finals '12 will be one of the best in a while, featuring the Spurs against another up-and-coming organization - the OKC Thunder.~~#~0
The worst meal I have eaten this entire year...AND the year is almost over.  8 of us  shared a birthday dinner...5 of us got sick.  I had a lamb dish (u know, greek specialty) and found that most of it was in the toilet by 2am....I then spent the next 30 hours in bed, with no strength due to food poisoning.  O MY food poisoning is not f-u-n.  I give this eating establishment ZERO friggin' stars.  I also need to mention that several friends (after my mentioning this meal and occurence) have said the same thing about this particular location of My BIG fat Greek restaurant.  They too have gotten sick after meals here.~~#~0
I've been a member since this place opened, and it has been going downhill since then.  This new $20/mo thing has really started to draw in a bad crowd into the gym to the point it feels unsafe these days.  I pay much more than that since I was sold a premier membership, so between my wife and I we pay $95/mo.  We were told from the beginning that our membership included unlimited access to the pool at the Palomar hotel when it was finished.  Just found out today that this was a lie and they have no such agreement.  If sent two emails to the regional manager regarding my concerns and have so far go no response.  I may quit soon since I'm not under contract.  To add to it, the CityScape project was a great idea, but the businesses in there are not looking for downtown locals.  They are geared more towards the "Scottsdale" type crowd. Stay away unless the location outweighs a bunch of negatives for you.~~#~0
Dont ever go to this Famous Footwear! Ever!!!!  I went in to return my shoes my mother got me for Christmas.  The "manager" could not figure out how to do an exchange so he decided to put the money on a gift card.  Which is fine, however when I go back to use the gift card there are no funds on the thing!  I got nowhere explaining this to the same "manager" I had before other than a snooty attitude as he walked off.~~#~0
Please don't take your pet there!They don't really seem to care about your animal, all they seem to care about is upselling you one of there plans or some testing or procedure that your pet probably doesn't need.My dog is already dying of kidney disease and they insisted on me getting her tested yet again before they would give me a new prescription card for her kidney disease dog food.  I believe the test was around $130 dollars.  Not surprisingly, my dogs levels were worse than the last time and since there is nothing they can do about it it was just a huge waste of money and it also made me sad to have it pointed out to me that she was getting worse and there is nothing that can do about it.I will never use them again.~~#~0
An absolute disaster of an experience tonight -- our server basically completely ignored us, our food took more than 45 minutes to arrive at our table, and by the time it did, I had forgotten what we'd ordered. While I try to be a decent tipper, this was the first time in a long time when I didn't feel any remorse about leaving no tip.The catfish that was served was slathered in sauce to the point where I didn't recognize what it was. The seafood stir-fry something or other was decent, as was the something-or-other soup, but by the time it was finally brought out, I didn't even care. I just wanted to leave because I had been waiting so long.The only redeeming factor was one of the servers/hosts comping us a beer and a Thai tea because of the delay in getting our food. Otherwise this would have been a zero-star review.Thai E-San may have decent food, but they need to learn how to handle a semi-busy night. This was an utter and complete FAIL as a dining experience. They need to learn how to better operate their kitchen and deliver the dishes ordered in a timely manner. Few foods are worth waiting for as long as we did.Until they get their act figured out, I recommend going somewhere else for Thai food.~~#~0
We stopped there after the Cubs game today. We were seated promptly and soon knew what we wanted to order, my wife and I both love Mexican food. There was one waitress and she was overwhelmed with seating people, taking drink orders, making the drinks and taking the food orders. Needless ot say, we waited forever to place our order. We ordered margaritas, but unfortunately they were out of triple sec. A Mexican restaurant that can't make margaritas?!?!?!?!?People were walking out after getting tired of waiting for their food. The waitress was apologizing for the slow service. I'm surprised that we were sooooo disappointed after reading so many glowing reviews by others.Nexdt time we're in Mesa, this won't on our list of must stops~~#~0
Happy hour is the only time this place is worth the effort. The portions are small, and all of the drinks are made with Skyy vodka and not much else. The servers aren't very friendly either,  and they seem to spend more time gossiping than taking care of customers. I'd rather take a risk at a hole in the wall sushi place... Blue Wasabi is no longer relevant and the 'blue' wasabi they serve with the sushi is ridiculous. I don't recommend this place to anyone in gilbert or scottsdale. Not impressed.~~#~0
So we walked into this place around 6pm.. it was SO hot and humid in there it was barely tolerable. After we were sat this baby started screaming and puking all over the mother, the table, itself.. was pretty disgusting. After getting over that the waitress brought over menu and chips and salsa. Took one bite of the salsa, that was it.. out of here. The salsa here is from a can.. tasted like tin with some added cumin. The chips were cold, greasy, stale and soggy form the humidity. Threw a buck in the table and walked out. Perhaps its better in the winter time sans the swamp coolers and the puking baby?~~#~0
Not good. Been waiting to try this place and so very disappointed. Cold under cooked bacon, just plain nasty spinach omlette, sad floppy un-browned home fries, did they open a green bag of "Simply Potatoes" and nuke them? And apparently we made a tragic mistake opting to eat inside, since it was hot on the patio. Employees yelling back and forth (not work, but goofing off-hey guys, it's small room with no acoustic merits-no need to yell), and one employee talking to her customer/friend at the counter so loudly about her drinking nites, that we could not hear each other, and heard way more about her personal habits than we cared to. Management must leave after the breakfast rush, or they don't care. Won't be back.~~#~0
Run like hell.  This used to be a company you could depend on but it is now corporate america and all they care about is the fat cat getting fatter.  Run!~~#~0
Al's is no more.  He has apparently sold both locations.  This one is now something like "Taste of Chicago".  Had a Chicago dog there and it was OK, but the place has lost its charm.  Al, I hope you're doing OK and weren't a victim of the recession.~~#~0
Not hot. Not even warm. Stone cold, kinda hard, not very fresh tasting. Hella sweet. Unsatisfying. Seriously, they are damaging their "brand" by opening this type of store. There is no difference between the Roosevelt store and picking up a box at the Circle K. What's next, a Little Debbie store front with a drive through?I needlessly feared that this location would spell a serious loss of business for our nearby Rainbow Donuts. I now appreciate them even more by comparison to Krispy Kreme.~~#~0
Agreed!  The Marquee in Tempe is a joke!  That was theeee worst place I've ever been to for a concert.  The ladies room was the fiflthiest I'd ever seen.  I mean 3rd world filfthy!  THERE ARE NOOOOOOO SEATS! NONE!  ZILGTH (SP?)!!!  If you're over 15 don't go there!  you'll stand allllllllll night long.  It was awful.  My feet were in so much pain.  This is not a place for pretty women.   don't wear heels to this place.  wear your slippers with plastic bags wrapped around them - use lots of duck tape!  there were drunk people walking, no, staggering with filled drinks.  you can picture the rest.ok I'm done.  I need to get that off my chest.Hey, if anyone sees Erayka B, give her the finger for me!~~#~0
We went here in March for my Father's birthday, when we made the reservation, we let them know. There are 3 big men in my family and they stuck us in some corner table that was hard for them to get in and out of. Our waiter was a man named "Brian" who was pretty sharp and rude. By the time we got there, it was late, we had a 9pm reservation so perhaps he had a long night. But my mother asked him to repeat something and he yelled "would you like some water?" It was pretty annoying because my mother is not hard of hearing or anything, she just didn't understand what he was asking. The food was mediocre. Anyway our friends had recommended this restaurant so highly that we were pretty disappointed. The waiter got a little nicer by the end of the dinner, but he had started out so bad, that we weren't impressed. Normally I would chalk this up to perhaps just the waiter having a bad day, but it just really isn't the most welcoming establishment. The restaurant does have a lot of ambiance and the outside area looked fantastic, but service plays a big part in where I would like to eat.~~#~0
Me Eek! Methinks not, assigned from the mixed use of language styles..is because this extremely busy place all the time clearly has a customer base in which they could afford to put up parking lot shade.  No matter what time of days..this place is packed..and they do a nice job of keeping lines moving, unilke poor Basha's who has one clerk at a time, but then again, you have to dodge the tumbleweeds as they blow through the aisles...And still..AVOID Starbucks...Go to Tully's...just as good, NOT as expensive..and NO LINES.~~#~0
Buffalo wild wings to me is like RA. Great atmosphere and service, but crappy food. I ordered twelve hot wings and a beer. We'll get to the beer in a minute. The wings were super greasy, like soaked in cooking oil. They were more sweet than hot, they tasted like they were dipped in sugar. The ranch was mayo with seasoning, and even had the same consistency as such. It was overall gross. I asked the difference in cost between a bud lite and a kiltlifter. The guy said, bud is $3 four a tall, and $4 for a kilt, as I began to order a kilt he verbally changed the price to $5.50. I will not return.~~#~0
My husband, my son and I all ate here yesterday. All I'm gonna say is that we have all been fighting for the bathroom ever since.~~#~0
Just when you think it couldn't get any worse! I too went back after I got down the road and realized they missed half the car and there was still bird shit on the window. They were first argumentative and said I should have purchased an upgraded wash if I really wanted a better job than what I got. They said they would redo it giving me a premium wash for no additional cost. I didn't get to excited about the upgrade since this was a 2010 Mercedes and still looked like new on the inside. All I wanted  was a clean exterior. Imagine the horror of getting to the pick up area and finding that they put amorall or a like kind of  dressing all over the dash, speaker grills, vents and door hardware. When I went back to the entry area for now the third time they insisted that they gave me this special treatment as part of their premium wash. I insisted that they remove it and they sent another guy in with a scubbing pad and some unknown solution.  When finished I had a blotchy colored dash with shiny looking areas all over the hard to get to areas. When I talked to the guy that said he was the manager he said he would check with his supplier the following week and see if he could get something to clean up the mess. He said he would call back a week ago. Still no call and a $50,000 car that looks like crap thanks to these people. It's too bad they don't  have a minus five selection here. This is a good place to send anybody that you really dislike.~~#~0
I usually go here about 1:45- 2:15 a.m. Fridays or Saturdays during the school year to watch people fight., the pizza tastes like cardboard, and the crust will cut the roof of your mouth. Also there ranch tastes weird...~~#~0
I've been to this location twice, and both times dealt with horrible service. Not only were our servers apathetic and ignorant of the menu; they were both unapologetically rude. She messed up almost all of our orders, and didn't even seem to care. I am usually very carefree when I go out to a sports bar, but it was starting to seriously annoy me. It's too bad, because the other BWW I used to go to in the north valley always had great service. But, this location needs serious employee "restructuring."~~#~0
When I stopped and asked for directions to this hotel, some girls explained the lack of a sign here because "if you don't already know where it is, then they don't want you there".  Real nice.  It wasn't easy to find.So upon walking in, the girl at the guest services was so snotty and rude I left.  Bad vibes. You could hear a friggin pin drop in that place it was so dead.Why hasn't this place closed yet?  Its so overrrated.  Old looking building, rude greeting staff.~~#~0
Our holiday luncheon was held here yesterday.  By far the worst I have ever attended.  Waited for water, which was finally plopped down dripping by the very angry waitress; the Diet Pepsi was EXPIRED (June 2011).  Appetizers passable.  The food was AWFUL!  Beef jerky instead of Roast Beef Au Jus.  The chicken must have been boiled - flavorless and bland.  The vegetables were undercooked and hard.  Salt & pepper mercifully arrived approximately 2/3 of the way through the meal.  Seconds were had by NOBODY!!  The waitstaff had two people who looked very nice.  The guy in the shorts - really??  And why were they all so grouchy?  We should have gone to Taco Bell.   Oh - the dessert was okay.~~#~0
What a disappointment.  No brown rice. Went with the white since it was supposed to be rice pilaf. Their rice pilaf was steamed white rice - pure junk. I think there was all of 1pea in it, slice in half. Their lamb was burned to a crisp and so dried out, it was garbage. It did not even taste like lamb anymore. It was completely dry and carbon covered. The plain Naan which I love elsewhere, was tasteless. I ordered a fancy Naan bread to go, got home and it was plain, no topping. Paid for the one with topping. Some chick pea dish was ok but there wasn't much of it. It came in a cup on the plate, about 2 oz or 3 oz worth. That and the rice pilaf was supposed to be my dinner.  Waited forever to get the food & we were the only people there - 2 of us. We sat for about an hour to get the food and about another hour and they did not bring our bill. We finally went to the cash register. These people call themselves a restaurant. The place looked pretty sad, not so clean. These people have to be struggling.  No wonder!  We will not be back. That is for sure.~~#~0
They're nice to you until you sign the bottom line.  Once the transaction is done they are terrible to deal with.  The owner called me a jerk and screamed at me over the phone because of something I was helping them wiht that they screwed up that took several hours out of my day.  He said I was misarable, yet he was the one yelling.  They really don't understand what needs to happen from cradle to grave when buying a car and the process.  I would stay away.  Also, why would anyone want to deal with an owner who can't handle a little pressure.This is my follow up to his comments below:Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you the owner of this place (his reply is below).  I encourage you to listen to that supposed recorded call.  I dare him to share it.  You'll find the first person who started yelling and getting upset what the owner, and not me.  Then to call me an "Ass" and hang up.  Other than a threat, I would never, regardless of what they said, call a customer of mine an "ass" and hang up on them (while screaming the whole time).  So you tell me, who's the angry person?  A curtsey call ... that's because I emailed him after picking up what they didn't do to find out if anything else was needed 5 weeks after I purcahsed a car from them.  Go ahead, buy a car from them if this is how you like to be treated.  Also, Sir, I saw in a previous comment threatening to sue someone because of a bad comment.  Let's see if you're all talk or not.  You have all my info, and that recorded call (which I call BS because why would you record a call and scream like a Valley Girl calling me names the whole time.~~#~0
I was in Scottsdale for a couple weeks about 2 months ago and decided to come here for dinner with a few coworkers one night, what a mistake. The service was horrible and slow, we had to chase down our server for our check and had to wait about 45 minutes for 1 burger and 3 salads, I'm guessing they had to butcher the cow in back or had to wait for the lettuce to grow. The place was not that busy so the fact that we had to wait that long for our food is unacceptable, not to mention we had to wait up front for the hostess to stop talking to her coworkers at the bar to come seat us. The food is way overpriced but in Scottsdale I guess that doesn't matter. It looks like a fun place from the outside but beware once you come in.~~#~0
Horrible service combined with bad food. Waitress started out with a bad attitude and a complete lack of desire to meet customer needs. Everything was a "no" rather than a "I'll see what i can do." Her helper brought my entree before the appetizer. I sent it back. 15 minutes later when I was done with the appetizer the waitress brought the same plate of food out! It had been baking under the heat lamp! They never filled my water glass. Salmon was dry and they were out of potatoes. Now waiting to see if waitress checks and notices I'm ready for my check. Never again at this place! (I ended up waiting for the check for about 10 minutes.) I ended up telling the waitress as i left how frustrated I was with my experience. She said she was sorry. I left in a hurry before she called me "hon" one more time!~~#~0
I am so pissed off, placed a TOGO order on phone, for Chicago style Large Cheese Pizza. I was told to collect the Pizza in 15-20 mins. I went there after 20 mins and guess what, my order is not in the system. She asked me If I can wait for another 10-15 mins, she started to place the order in the system, and the system showed Pizza to b $17.xx, but their online menu has the same Pizza for $14.xx, I asked her to Not put 1 Topping Large Pizza, and just put Cheese large Pizza. BUT SHE DIDN:T GET IT... I got pissed off and came back home. I am not planning to go their again.~~#~0
If bland, cold pizza delivered as much as 90 minutes after you order it is something that brings you joy, by all means give this place a call for delivery. If you also like tomato sauce sporadically slopped all over the place with neither it nor any cheese existing in random spots on the pie, you're really in luck.It's a sin that this one of the only pizza delivery places in the downtown Phoenix area so far. Thankfully it's not the only one.~~#~0
Live bug in sauceI saw a bug crawling in Green sauce which I already put it in my food.  When I reported it to waiter there she just disappeared with the sauce. No one came to my table for 10 minutes and  I had to call waiter to replace my food with bug infected food after 10 minutes.Worst experience ever.~~#~0
Landed late. Frantically located a gate agent. Got laughed at. ("There is no way you will make that connection.") Sprinted to the ticket counter. Found out that in order to get to the next gate, I have to go to another terminal. This is a simple task in most other airports. Here it means exiting the airport, getting on a bus, reentering through the security checkpoint at the next terminal, and then sprinting full throttle to the wrong gate for the flight that I *just* missed because the sweet little old lady in the friendliest airport in America gave me the wrong directions and the security personnel spent five precious minutes chatting about their weekend plans with my belongings in their hands. What a cluster fuck. The free wi-fi came in handy for the three hours that I waited for the next flight.~~#~0
Ok - so I used to live minutes from china town in NYC...  so I'm perhaps a little spoiled.  I realize that.   I still have not found a Chinese food place here in phoenix that I'm crazy about...I'm pretty much resigned to the fact that I'm not gonna.That being said... this is by far the *worst* Chinese I've had here so far.They are right around the corner from where i live so i decided to give it a try for take out one night...they got our order wrong, it took forever, and it was completely flavorless...  I had a few bites and lost my appetite. Maybe I ordered the wrong things...  maybe I was there on an off night...  who knows.  But as far as I'm concerned - Vegetable lo mien shouldn't be that difficult to get right.  My boyfriends meal (forget what he got) was no better.  I won't be going back.  Its a real shame too since the location is ideal for me....~~#~0
poor excuse for a Westcor pad occupant. See "Waiting" (the movie). Yeah, it's that place.--grilled cheese sandwich looked like a brillo pad after three weeks' use (see my picture)--servers confused, unaware of their own menu--and that was just the content; they were filthy--service timings all off--soda syrups not properly proportionedmethinks it's the location. just stay away.~~#~0
I was really excited about trying this place.  I went on a gluten free diet over two years ago and have not had decent Thai food since then because of the language barrier at our favorite place.  Recently, I found Latitude 8 on the web and gave them a call.  They assured me that they could prepare many of their items gluten-free.  When I told the woman I was coming that night, she said "I am on tonight, just ask for me or the owner, David."  She never mentioned the need for a reservation.A few hours later, my wife and I arrived at the restaurant.  When we told them we did not have a reservation (before 6:00), we were told that they could not get us within anything like a reasonable time frame, despite the fact that the majority of the tables were open.  So, we went down the street to Zocalo, which was excellent.I am still anxious to try Latitude 8 and will definitely do so as soon as possible.  Still, I was very annoyed by the failure to advise me that a reservation might be necessary.~~#~0
I really doubt Down Under will welcome my review, but I HAVE to do it just to get this off my chest. I spent a very long and frustrating hour+ this morning on the patio with my dog and some friends. My dog, Peekaboo seemed to enjoy it, but I HATED it! There was a "Doggie Day Sunday brunch on the patio" event going on on. I had scheduled a FindMyDogADate AZ Meetup there for this doggie event. All of the tables and chairs were taken when I arrived by the people running their doggie event tables. Eventually I found a table with two wet chairs directly under the very wet misters. (It's no wonder no one wanted to sit there). Since I had four other people coming, I scrounged up more chairs. All of them were directly under the dripping misters.After my friends arrived, I went inside to grab some brunch. They were charging a ridiculous $12 for rubbery whatever that was, cold eggs, rock hard pancakes and a tiny dish of grapes served by a lady who couldn't even tell me the price of the brunch. The orange juice was extra so I asked for a glass of water. I got a plate full of yuck, sat down in the wet chair while the water dripped on my plate of yuck making it even yuckier. I took my uneaten plate back after one bite and told them I would go eat at McDonald's. YUCK!!The patio needs to be condemned! I was tempted to call the health inspector! Dogs had pooped on the gravel behind the tables and it wasn't cleaned up. No doggie poop bags were to be found anywhere. Luckily I had brought some with me. After cleaning it up, there weren't any trash cans available to dispose of it!!! The "waitress" never stopped by our table the entire time!All on all it was a very dirty and disappointing experience. Is there a -1 star rating?~~#~0
Don't even think about it!! Terrible customer relations and once you start paying you have to invest hours of time and frustration trying to cancel your membership.~~#~0
Very poor. Ordered 1 pizza at 18:20, email received indicating that the pizza would be delivered in 30 - 40 minutes.  At 45 minutes, telephoned the store and was told sorry, internet timing was incorrect, actual wait time would be 45 - 60 mins.  Told it's the next pizza to be delivered, should be 5 - 10 mins.  At least 15 - 20 mins. later, pizza finally arrived.  No apology, nothing.So, from being 30 - 40 mins., pizza actually arrived in 60 - 70 mins.Apparently you're required to award 1 star... which in this case is 1 star too many.~~#~0
I have eaten here twice (hoping my first experience was just a bad fluke... but sadly it wasn't). The service at this place is HORRIBLE. My first visit, I told the waiter that this was my first time and he said "that's nice" and just walked away. It took forever to get drink refills, salsa for our chips, etc. The waiter just didn't care and treated us like we were inconveniencing his otherwise very lazy day (FYI, we were one of 3 tables in the entire place... it was pretty dead in there). The sad part is the food was actually pretty good, so we decided to give it another shot. The next time we went, the service level was just as bad even though we had a different server (a waitress this time). Asking for extra water, salsa, etc. seemed like such a chore for her... and she'd disappear into the kitchen for long periods of time, then come back with one little thing for one of the 3-4 tables of people (again, pretty dead in there) and would then disappear again... it really seemed like she was avoiding the customers. For such a small, dead place... you would think they would be trying to WOW their customers to drum up some new business, but no... they don't want you here. Customers are just a nuisance to them.~~#~0
I read the other review and was shocked because my experience was very different. Yes, the temple is clean and open for business but polite and open the priest was not!  I would say people from other faiths sure don't feel welcome when it's only the priest present.  The current temple priest who performed my wedding (I married an Hindu) was RUDE, Rude, rude (had I known this was how it was going to go down I would have used the priest from Bharatiya Ekta Mandir of Arizona).  Sadly we only met in-person (my fiance had several phone conversations the months leading up to out wedding) with the priest the week before our wedding and it was perfectly obvious that he disliked me and my lack of Hindi.  I attempted to ask question to better understand the ceremony but that just got me scowls and grumbles.  The day of our wedding the priest was not ready and was acting as if he had forgotten about the ceremony and/or the deposit we made.  Finally, after the ceremony when it was time to sign the marriage certificate he asked (actually demanded) an additional $300 to sign the certificate.  Of course we agreed- what were we to do?  I am pretty sure that would be called extortion and why hadn't he simply told us before the ceremony?  I am guessing because he is a thief!~~#~0
Unfortunately, I didn't get to taste the food, as the overwhelming smell of sewage forced me to leave before I could order. We instead went next door to "On the Grill"~~#~0
OVERPRICED LOUSY bar food.  WTF to this place.  we all ordered the tacos, we could have done better at taco bell,  $15 for two weird overly fishy tacos with a pile of crunchy undercooked plain white rice with a blob of black beans on top. $10 for a plate of rubbery strange tasting wings and the best yet was paying $5 for a SMALL  plate of limp cold garlic fries. it came to $100 including tip for three of us and we were there during happy hour and only had one drink a piece. NEVER EVER again this place sucks, pardon my french lol.~~#~0
I'm born and raised from Hawaii, and this did not taste like anything back home.  I asked the owner if they are from Hawaii, and they said no, they haven't been there.   That was sooo disappointing.  I won't go back.  The service sucked too!~~#~0
Hmmm.. What is soft opening? Anyway I came in today and ordered their eggrolls and large pho. Reminder, eggrolls here are 4 dollars for only two rolls.. I agree with the user below stating that the meat was mystery meat. Not authentic at all. The vegetables given was inedible.. Why try so hard to make a plate pretty, I would have honestly would have wanted a plate full of lettuce than the random veggies given. I was also displeased with my eggrolls comming out soggy. It ain't hard to fully dry vegetables before putting it on the plate. On to the pho... It was just meh. Nothing special didn't taste authentic either... There large is like a medium. Another problem I had was how the restaurant tried so hard to be "modern" so modern that there weren't any silverware or napkins on the table.. I felt as if I had to constantly ask my server for things I needed. Then again it's a soft opening. Comming from a vietnamese person, the food is not authentic... Not that it's a problem... I rather go somewhere else with bad service and yummy food than a place with okay service and mediocre food. A soft opening is no excuse for meh pho and weird tasting eggrolls... Too pricey I might add. Hopefully next time around it will get better~~#~0
I really wanted to love this because I am a downtown resident who loves to eat out, but I'm sad to say I won't go here again for dining.  I left feeling that I had just spent $15 on a small bowl of spaghetti-o's, and the packaged, stale breadsticks also left a lot to be desired.I hope the powers-that-be at PastaBAR will note the negative reviews and re-work the menu, because the location and decor are amazing!~~#~0
Why would they 'fix' something that wasn't broken???  The place used to be slammed all the time but not any more.If I wanted cheap Asian slop on plastic I'd go to Panda Express down the street.  Pei Wei was my favorite place to eat and now I hate it there.  All my favorite things are gone from the menu.  My beloved Pad Thai and the Thai Dynamite are gone and so am I.~~#~0
About 40% of games broken, this location used to be fun now u gamble when u put a quarter in any machine. Good luck. If it was not for my daughter I would never set foot inside this place. I would rather pay 20 dollars for games at Peter Pipper and atleast ALL the game will work. Thumbs down. I guess the creator of Chucky Cheese does not care if its franchise drowns.~~#~0
Well..... All airplanes feel the same, once your up in the air it's all on faith! But one thing airline need to and should change is their bag policy! I mean it really is insane that after going over 1 lbs on ur bag they can charge upto 300% not to mention the initial $25! It really is a bunch of bull!~~#~0
Stopped in for happy hour-not so happy! The food was mediocre at best and 1/2 off house wine was $6 for a glassSo many other choices in the area~~#~0
We've been going to Cider Mill since they opened and have given them a ton of business.  Their food is great.  Had an awful experience today.  We went to order our food and the people who work there know us and that we're very good customers... they told us it would be in excess of 1/2 hour to get our sandwiches.  People, you better staff up if you want to stay in business and keep your customers coming back.  30+ minutes is way too long for people on lunch break (that is in addition to commuting, ordering, and eating).  We ended up leaving and going to Orange Table (a sandwich shop on the Scottsdale Mall area).  Incredible sandwiches.  Because of the experience we had at Cider Mill today, i'll likely go to Orange Table instead which is a 2 minute walk from Cider Mill.  Get your act together Cider Mill.~~#~0
More like Bad China, I say. Got take-out. Kung Pau chicken, curry shrimp, beef brocolli 2 egg rolls. Kung Pau was 90% celery and the chicken that was there was very very poor; tough, just crappy cuts...awful bland taste too. The beef brocolli was also bland, and the beef was poor quality...very tough. The curry shrimp was "ok". The eggrolls sucked!! I paid over $30 and will definitely not be back.~~#~0
We were going to eat at Beavers Choice but they were closed today. We decided to try Ted's Hot Dogs since so many people everywhere including the workplace rave about this place. Our order was taken and we got to the part were they top your order I noticed they put BBQ sauce on my no sauce chicken sandwich. I didn't want to hold up the long line to ask for a replacement.THE MAIN REASON FOR THE ONE STAR RATING I tasted my iced tea and I am not certain what they filled my cup with? I didn't see bubbles for soda but it didn't taste like iced tea but the color was sort of dark. I asked my husband to taste it and he couldn't tell me what it was either. I think it might have been a mix of iced tea and diet soda syrup. I did NOT drink it and took a few sips of my husbands soda. If I can't trust them to give me iced tea that is a problem. The hot dog is extra fatty and greasy, the BBq chicken sandwich is overpowered with sauce and grizzle.AlsoThe onion rings were a bag of greasy unseasoned crumbs with only a few pieces of onion. I know most people Love Ted's and they are most likely OK most of the time so give them a try!~~#~0
This place has slipped significantly in the past 6 months.  No meat in the rolled tacos, smaller and smaller burritos, same or higher prices.  I would like to direct anyone close by to Armando's on 48th St and Thomas.  Cheaper, better tasting and larger portions.  This Filiberto's has become run-of-the-mill and cheap.  Other good reasons to stay away:  adjacent to a bus stop and a telemarketing joint.  Enough said.~~#~0
Classy as a Lap Dancer leaving a skid mark on a man's lap that is a indication of the way they cook filet's of beef here here . (crap on your plate)Remember the Movie Logan's Run where they killed everyone that reached 30 years old well I am over 30 but I felt like dying after trying my meal we've been here years ago but thought maybe they weren't as bad as we remembered .We were seated and it took around 15 minutes for someone to acknowledge us as we noticed the table next to us that got seated latter and already had food before we even had water ok so that was no big deal it happens all the time at chains .My husband ordered the $4.99 for 2 margarita's (I knew better) and I took a sip and it tasted like you licked a spoonful of dry artificial drink mix . (YUK)This place had a MASSIVE amount of peanut shells and DUST all over the floor so if you were wearing flip flops you might cut your toes on shells .They have a bucket of peanuts on every table and I hope little dirty kids hands weren't on them not to mention peoples coughs .When my meal arrived I thought it looked ALMOST picture perfect because my vegetable skewer looked great with real fresh vegetables on it but when I tasted them they were awful because they brushed them with I COULD TASTE cheap Italian dressing and some sort of brown NASTY sauce (YUK) ! Then I saw my potato with all that melted whipped butter that looked like SPIT (YUK)! (it wasn't but looked like that the way the butter melted)  but maybe the WORST was what they did to the filet....WTB (bleep) they brushed the filet with liquid smoke and maybe a terriyakki sauce and that was another YUK! I consider the filet not edible the way it tasted and took it home for dog treats (I washed sauce off for my dog of course) The sauces on the vegetables and on my filet were awful and ruined them in taste and as far as I know they are not listed in description on menu . This was not the most expensive meal but not that cheap either (mine was $16) but even if it was free I still would not recommend . Now that I Yelped I will remember years from now that I didn't like . One star ?  two stars ? but my understanding of definition is eeks me thinks not meaning I won't go back not just I had better...duh..I am not a fan of here.....maybe you are?.....not the best  quality but it really is too amateur to go out for it's like your relative that can't cook and just throws stuff in a bag with Italian dressing and then throws it on the grill . it was close and I didn't feel like going far but I should have done a Logan's RUN AWAY!~~#~0
A local friend recommended us to try this place and said it had good sushi. We'd good sushi there but it wasn't anything you cannot get from Ra Sushi or any other spots in Scottsdale. The price was 2x the other sushi spots. Furthermore the portions were really small too. The decor was nice and trendy but we didn't see any trendy people there on a Saturday night. The only plus was the wine and mixed cocktails.~~#~0
I have been to many Oregano's around town but this one is by far the worst one yet.  Took the family to eat lunch on a weekday.  We ordered the calamari, order of hot wings, and a stuffed pizza.When the drink order came, our waitress (some big chested short blonde lady) forgot the lemons to the water.  When one of us asked if we could get lemons for the passion fruit tea, the waitress curtly replied, "We don't put lemons in passion fruit tea."  When asked to get some any way, she begrudgingly went and got some for the tea. The calamari... disappointment.  The calamari itself was okay, but I didn't expect the best.  The problem was the lack of portion.  There wasn't enough to even cover the plastic plate it was served on.  Just some scattered about on a large plastic plate.  If the portions are going to be this small, at least put it on a smaller plate to make it LOOK LIKE the portions are larger.  Just try a little bit harder.The hot wings... good.  I was pleasantly surprised.The stuffed pizza... first, if you are a regular at Oregano's you know that stuffed pizza take a long time, but generally they are worth it.  Not this time.  When we got our pizza, the pizza crust was thin as paper.  Worst of all, the ENTIRE bottom was burnt!  Not just spots of burnt crust... THE ENTIRE BOTTOM CRUST was BURNT.The time we were there, we saw our original waitress (big chested short haired blonde) twice.  Then I saw her leave and not say bye or let us know she was leaving.  So we did not get to see another waiter for awhile.  When we finally got our bill, I was very surprised.  They charged $2 for some jalapenos we had asked for.  It was billed as extra toppings for the pizza, but the jalapenos weren't enough to cover a large stuffed pizza.  That was my last straw, I hate getting nickeled and dimed out of little things like extra condiments or pickles.I really wanted to like this place since it is the closet to our home, but I will not be going back.~~#~0
this location gives Marshall's a bad name. a friend and I were in the mood for some great deals and we both decided we 'needed' new shoes. I said let's try Marshall's! It's usually better than Ross or TJ and the biggest one I know of in the valley is at AZ Mills. We got there around 7:30 or 8pm after dinner and about 20 minutes before closing we had to use the restroom REALLY bad (FYI- eating low carb candy before a shopping trip is a VERY bad idea, read the warning label on those low-carb snacks) anywho......they did not have a restroom for us to use but instead gave us directions to the closest one. At this point we had 2 shopping carts EACH filled with fantastic finds(a lot more than the pair of shoes we went in for) and had already become so attached that we didn't feel comfortable leaving our carts just anywhere thinking someone would try to steal our  hot items or put them away.so we kindly asked if we could place our carts behind the counter or right next to it while we rushed to the bathroom. the girl gave me one of THE nastiest looks ever and said "um no".surprised by her rudeness, i got a little bit of an attitude and said "UM then where do you want me to put them?!?!" she rolled her eyes again, "fine, leave them here." and off to the bathroom we ran. we got back about 5-10 minutes before closing(i used to work in retail so i know how annoying it is when customers come before close but we were done shopping and just wanted to pay). 5-10 minutes was just enough time for us to do that anyway. so we came back in and the girls working there were so nasty with us. they were complaining out loud while we waited in line about how much they hate when people come in as they're closing and out loud said "don't they have any damn respect?" i knew AZ mills was ghetto....I just ignored them but my friend pretty much told them to shut their dirty little mouths because they weren't even closed yet. if the deals we found weren't so awesome we would have left but we bought our stuff and neither one of us will ever return. our business is obviously wanted and appreciated elsewhere.this place makes me want to say really bad words!!!!!!!~~#~0
Its amazing how people are led to believe that this place serves delicious Mexican food. I would like to know WHAT they are ordering. Been there once and never went back again thanks to their awful long lingering wait staff that took forever to bring us drinks and food along with the low quality of the food. The chicken enchiladas I ordered were disgusting to say the least, chicken was black and gross, and they were covered in a mountain of what seemmed to be green ooze that was trying to be salsa verde with nacho cheese. Never been back.~~#~0
CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED...  Right around the christmas holiday, We noticed the place was suddenly closed up, (a nice Christmas surprise for the employees I'm sure).  And there were U-Hauls out front taking things out of there.I was told by a couple of frequent patrons, and some of the other building's tennants, that it was seized by the IRS, and the owner went bankrupt there after.   ?? I don't think it was even open for a full year!~~#~0
I went and I was greatly disapointed. I had a simple 14" mushroom, onion and cheese pizza . It was barely 4 sliced mushrooms on the entire thing! The crust though different was not that great either. Beverages are all totally overpiced. I'm a fan of hard ciders especially Hornsby's cider. One bottle here is only .50 cheaper than a 6 pack. My simple pizza was just shy of $18!!  The host at the door just let me walk in and take a seat. she seated everyone else. I set for 7 minutes until my waiter came and then he got me a menu.   There's a survey you can take on your reciept that gives you $5 off your next visit. I wish I could just have my evening back and my money. I brought half the pizza home which was my plan to tkae it for lunch tomorrow. Nope I will wreck my 30 min lunch break with this crap!   I was hoping a homeless or street person would approach me and I could give it away, but none did.~~#~0
Based upon all the positive reviews (OBVIOUSLY RELATIVES!!) my son and I went in here... let me start by this is in a section of town that I would NEVER be caught in... absolutely NOT AFTER DARK!! One of the highest crime areas in Mesa!!  After we locked the car, we go into this place and it is a complete and utter RUN DOWN DUMP!!  We were the only ones there and this older hispanic man was running around with trays and bags and acting like a lunatic.  He NEVER ONCE even acknowledged us.  Finally after about 10 minutes I asked him if we could get some service and he RUDELY told me that he had orders of tamale dozens to get out and he didn't HAVE TIME!!  WHAT?? You have a restaurant establishment and you don't have time to wait on a customer that has driven to your place to buy your friggin' food??  I guess my look on my face startled him... and then he said if I wanted to wait he would be with me in a bit... then he immediately went into the back room and left us once again!I turned to my son is complete astonishment and I asked him if he wanted to wait and he replied that we had driven all the way over here... that we might as well.  So we had a seat and continued to watch this maniac run to the trays and trays of tamales out front and then go in the back... I watched this for another 20 minutes.  Then he disappeared for quite a while and by that time we had been there 45 minutes... CAN YOU IMAGINE WAITING 45 MINUTES FOR A FRIGGIN TAMALE??  He never did come back out and so we left TO NEVER COME BACK!!  Maybe your tamale's are good but to offer this kind of non-service with a DON'T CARE attitude.... is absolutely reprehensible.  YOU SHOULD BE PUT OUT OF BUSINESS!!  My first call is to the City of Mesa Health Department!!I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE!!~~#~0
If you walk into a sushi bar and are overwhelmed by the smell of BBQ sauce and there is none on the menu, leave immediately. Unfortunately I failed to heed my own premonition and "dined" here. Don't do the same please...and save the money and gastrointestinal issues.~~#~0
Yesterday I took my yorkie here for the Rabies shot. There was no information that because I was 2 monthes late in getting it that they would not give me a certificate for 2 or more years. So now I have to take her back again next year to get what they are calling a booster. this is just a rip off. I don't know why I have gone there. They are only interested in money. They also said I needed three other shots. This is after I asked by phone a month ago what all she needed and was told rabies. Turns out that two of those shots were not really needed. I will not go here. READ WHAT THEY GIVE YOU WHILE YOU ARE THERE. They did not explain it at all.  They are only interested in selling you expensive options and what they can make money on. Didn't have to wait too long tho. Guess that is because everyone else figured this out a long time ago and already went somewhere else. I asked if this was their policy and she said it is Az. state. So when the office is open I will call and ask them exactly who made this policy or is it Just pet smart making more money!Very UNHAPPY previous customer.~~#~0
I came to Spoonz with some classmates and without expectations. However, I was very disappointed. The atmosphere, service and prices were mediocre. I can live with mediocre, but I cannot live with disgusting over-priced food... which is exactly what Spoonz is.If you want to spend your good money on terrible food then I highly recommend Spoonz, however I do not plan on returning.~~#~0
The food is not good.  The scene is difficult to enjoy if you have progressed beyond the frat party stage of your life.~~#~0
Not a fan of this place at all. Horrible tasting beef and pork. Every time I have ate at this place I have gotten sick. No going back for me.  I know there are a ton of peeps on here that love it, but I guess its all just a matter of preference.  I have not been happy and am not a fan at all!  I have given them many opportunities too.~~#~0
I love Matt Pool's restaurants, so I keep going back to Giant in hopes that it won't disappoint.  The food is amazing, the coffee is great, and the atmosphere is everything you are looking for...BUT the service is terrible.  I have gone three times, each time the service is awful.  The first time it was just slow, no big deal, it was the girls second day.  The second time I was ignored for 10 minutes, then the girl forgot my drink order (It was coffee with soy milk).  Then this weekend I tried it again.It was stormy outside and the perfect day to sip coffee, eat breakfast, and shop at Bunky's.  I ordered a coffee (black this time) and the baked eggs with toast WITHOUT PROSCIUTTO.  I paid the $8 for eggs and toast without complaint since I was the person being difficult.  It took 15 minutes to get my coffee (remember its just plain drip coffee), no big deal, I can wait. Then another 20 minutes after I received my coffee the guy comes by with my eggs and toast, covered in prosciutto.  He asks if this is my order and I tell him I ordered it without the meat.  He says, "oh, then I will bring you a side plate." I tell him that isn't what I want, and that I don't eat meat.  To this he responds with indignation, "what are you allergic?" I tell him no I am a vegetarian.  He then says, "ok well I will go just pick it off."  At that point I get a refund and call in an order to Matt's Big Breakfast for pick up.  It was only a 15 minute wait, was without meat, and was served with a smile.  Hoping that someone reads this and give the staff some much needed customer service training.  Matt is a talented chef and restaurateur hoping that this problem is fixed.  On a nice side note the outdoor seating is dog friendly.~~#~0
I went to Yasda Bento for the first time today and had a terrible experience. It was during the lunch hour, but they were not terribly busy. I ordered their advertised lunch special, a simple beef dish. It took over 20 minutes to arrive, even though there were only 2 orders ahead of mine. When the meal arrived, the amount of beef present in the dish was so scarce that I was surprised they actually called the dish "beef" anything. It was practically a garnishment. When I asked for more, the staff simply said, "that's how it's prepared." The meal itself was marginal at best. Also, their bathroom was an absolute mess. The combination of an overly long wait, a minimal amount of meat in a dish advertised as a "beef" dish, a dismissive staff, and a disgusting bathroom was more than enough to convince me never to frequent their establishment again.~~#~0
My husband and I went to Fatburger for the first time.  We both ordered 16 oz burger skinny fries and shakes.  The bottom bun was full of greese, the top bun was a little stale.  The fries tasted like the oil was old.  The shakes were great.  The meal was almost $30.  We will not be back.~~#~0
I went here with a group for a bridal shower and rented one of the private rooms.  Now, we knew this was Scottsdale, so it would be expensive, but generally, I've never had a "bad" experience in Scottsdale as a result.  Well, this was it.  The room wasn $75 an hour and boy was tiny- it said for 10, but we had 10 people and at least two had to sit on the floor the entire time.  We were supposed to get a $75 tray with the room and it came with three 1/2 order apps and three rolls- all with crab.  Now, if I added it up according to the menu, there was no way it came to that value.  The karoke song menu was marginal, lots of duplicate songs and songs with tracks that we had never heard- despite knowing the song line by line. On top of that, the service was terrible- the waitress kept coming in to refill our water, but we had to practically demand her to take a drink or food order. Then, when we got our drinks, there were only 3 people who found their drink good- or even palatable- and matched what was stated/shown on the drink menu.  The sushi tray was OK at best, and although two people did order sushi and say it was OK, the rolls were loosely done.  The two salads we got were not very good at all.  The cobb salad had a lot of toppings, but very little dressing and the lettuce was weird.  Not sure how, but it was.   The ceasar salad was dry and tasteless according to my friend. I would never go back again nor would I reccomend anyone else to go back either.~~#~0
This place makes me sad. Thingz has some pretty nice lookin' decor but their prices are OUTRAGEOUS. If I had the money I would maybe consider buying a bar stool here or something but I just can't see how this business is still around with our recent economy. Here is exactly what I mean. This giant apple costs $425!!!!!!!!!!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/goSD2ufNVQDgqpb6FmUt5A?select=p2aidd2YC_WLUTMNJE5JlgNo, I'm not kidding. Do you want a giant apple? I would maybe pay 10 bucks and put it in my classroom as a joke...~~#~0
Screaming kids and frozen seafood. That is about all this place had to offer. After years of not going to Red Lobster, I decided to try it again for their "crabfest" special. Unfortunately, I was reminded of why I quit going here. Upon arriving, we were greeted by a large party with mainly young kids that were screaming and being abnoxious. UNCLE RANDY!!!! God you would think they hadn't seen their uncle, well, ever! Anyways, we were finally seated, unfortunately, not nearly far enough away from the hoards of screaming kids and babies. My husband and I do not have kids nor do we want them. We love to be able to go out to dinner but its gotten to the point where most restaurants are "family friendly" which usually entails jerk kids and parents that have learned to tune them out. Quite irritating and inconsiderate actually. In any event, I opted for the crab trio which came with king crab legs, snow crab legs, and crab stuffed shrimp. I ordered the creamy lobster mashed potatoes and a cup of the clam chowder. The hub ordered the shrimp trio which came with two types of shrimp (can't remember what they were but when i asked the hub, he stated "sh*t, mostly just sh*t.") and schrimp pasta. He officially hates Red Lobster if you couldnt tell. Both him and I agreed that most of our food tasted as if it was frozen and from a bag. The clam chowder tasted canned. The cheesy sauce on my potatoes along with my shrimp tasted fowl and almost had a chemical taste to it. And most importantly, the biscuits which we had looked forward so much to were overcooked and dry. These used to be the best part of the meal but they have really gone downhill. Actually the restaurant in general has gone downhill. The service was ok but I have one complaint. Although they give you crab crackers, they don't give you the other little gadget that you use to tear the crab so its easier to open. This would have helped alot when I was eating my king crab legs considering that they are thorny and sharp. Not worth cutting up my petite cute little hands to get a little bit of crab meat. Haha.To wrap it up, we will never go back unless we have company and they want to go there. Then I guess we would have to find something to choke down. It sucks because we used to love Red Lobster when they first came out but the quality of, well, everything has gone down throughout the years. The price however, I am fairly certain has gone up. If I am going to pay nearly $40 for a meal, I expect it to be fresh and magnificent, and I expect to not see a misbehaved child in sight. I am not normally a fan of more upscale restaurants but I think i might be giving more of those types of places a try after eating at Red Lobster.~~#~0
MY REAL STAR RATING IS 0 STARSI will make this review very quick.... I wasn't expecting this food to be bursting with flavor and just out of sight delicious.... I was expecting it to be good average Chinese food..... I was totally wrong..... I called in my order for delivery and I ordered sweet and sour chicken and the Hunan beef with an extra egg roll and it came with crab puffs.... Lets first start off with the sweet and sour chicken..... It was drenched in sweet and sour sauce and the sauce was way too sweet....it had huge chunks of pineapples in it.... it was soggy and disgusting..... I prefer to have my sweet and sour sauce on the side.... The Hunan beef was nasty it was dry and cold and it wasn't spicy at all.... The veggies were Blah.... The crab puffs were soggy and the egg rolls.... They weren't even egg rolls they were more like spring rolls but they still sucked..... They were horrible...!!!!! The worst egg rolls I ever ate in my life.... I would prefer Panda Express any day over this place.... The rice was dry and disgusting....This food made me sick.... After eating just a couple bites a few minutes later .... My body immediately rejected it and it upset my stomach really badly.... I ended up releasing the food immediately through a bowel movement.... My body has never reacted like that before.... It felt like I had rocks in my tummy.... I felt weak and nausea and I believe I had a very short case of food poisoning..... Thank God I only ate a few bites...  or I probably would have been sick for a couple days.... My suggestion is that they need to be closed down.... THEIR FOOD IS HORRIFIC....!!!! RUN FOR YOUR LIFE IF YOU WANT TO LIVE....!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!~~#~0
I like Wal Mart. I really do. Just not this one. I feel like I need to take a shower after I'm done shopping here.~~#~0
Extremely rude service not only on the phone but in person at this location. DO NOT RECOMMEND. Was told on phone that there was a 45 minute wait and I could get my blood drawn since it was close to closing time for them and I drove to this location and the door was locked and women wouldn't speak to me through the door and just yelled "WE CAN"T HELP YOU WE ARE CLOSED."  I showed up a few minutes past them closing even though they were treating patients still. The woman wasn't even willing to speak to me like a human in order to answer my questions or apologize for giving me incorrect information. She yelled at me outside a locked door and wouldn't open the door.  I stayed outside shocked by this behavior. Not only was I given incorrect information on the phone, but I was treated horribly. I am going to switch my lab needs to LAB CORP. It is probably a blessing in disguise as who knows if getting blood drawn is safe here with the angry and insensitive people they have working there.~~#~0
These people are the rudest people!  Spend your money with some one who appreciates your business!!!!~~#~0
Bartender (Danielle) at the bar was foul-mouthed, loud, and obnoxious.  Really put a damper on the experience.Their beer specials aren't that good ($5 Stella).~~#~0
We got a gift card for Olive Garden and decided to give it a try after YEARS of NOT.  We actually waited for almost 20 minutes to be seated.  Our service was okay.  Greeted by the server offering us a taste of chardonnay that we passed on.  We ordered stuffed mushrooms.  I think they were alright.  They came out hot and although they were salty and nothing special, they were not bad.  All you can eat salad came with mine and the bread sticks of course.  Salad was hideous and full of vinegar.  Just a bunch of light green lettuce with just alright stuff thrown in.  Bread sticks were warm and alright.  Jerome ordered a Caesar salad and the guy said it'd be "like a dollar more" for substitution.  It was the same as the all you can eat salad but with mayo instead of the vinegar.  YUCK again.  Boxed croutons and fake cheese.  I ordered shrimp Caresse.  Jerome ordered braised ribs.  ILK!  Both of them were so yuck.  The ribs were fatty and not flavorful.  They were tasteless and awful.  The sauce was not reduced and it tasted like beef bouillon and cheap red wine.  The rice was alright but again, that beef bouillon salty flavor.  There were some green beans on top that I ate.  They were fine.The shrimp on my plate were undercooked.  The angel hair pasta was fine.  But as I ate, I was reminded of Ra men Noodles.  Instead of beef bouillon they gave me chicken.  The tomatoes in mine were fine.We got our check and it was $49.something!  I can't believe it!  We eat out a lot and usually, it comes to 50 or 60 bucks at places like that.  What a rip.  I kept thinking that it was alright that the food sucked because it is cheap.  It wasn't even cheap.  For Italian food that tastes good for about the same price, Oregano's is wonderful!We will NEVER go there again.  Don't know why people ever go there.~~#~0
To put it simply, calling this Japanese is insulting. It is a teriyaki place and they don't get that right. Corn syrup and sugar is not teriyaki sorry but no thanks. Also the staff is unfriendly and would rather stare at their cell phones then say hello. Won't be back.~~#~0
The customer service here is outrageous! I will never be back here and recommend you take your money somewhere else. There are plenty of rock climbing gyms that you would be better off giving your business to a better and friendlier company. I walked out after 40 minutes at the front desk with out ever rock climbing and not getting my money back. Extremely disappointing experience for what was supposed to be a fun adventure.~~#~0
ATMOSPHERE: Fun, if you have kids or if you happen to like a fake Disneyland environment like a modern day Tiki Room.FOOD:  Really bad and WAY overpriced!!!!SERVICE: Very poor...I think they hire Food Servers with no common sense or any people skills.OVERALL: Save your dime...mosey on over to the Food Court after you stand there ogling over the animatronic alligator and fake fog. Paying for overpriced, crappy food with bad service is NOT worth it.~~#~0
I hate this location. So much. So so so much. Every single time I have come here (it's been more than a few, trust me), they manage to royally screw up my order. It's not that hard people, you slice the bagel, you toast it, you give me my cream cheese on the side. I don't know how many times they give me the wrong cream cheese, don't toast the bagel, or put the cream cheese on it. Wrong! Wrong wrong wrong! Also, the employees here are either ignoring you or are clueless. As well as slightly unpleasant. Oh! And it's dirty - check out their "espresso bar".~~#~0
Sapporo is the place to go if you don't really want to eat.  Go for Happy Hour to hang out on the patio with the beautiful people in Scottsdale.  My friend and I went for Happy Hour, the bar area was full so we sat at a bar table near the sushi bar.  We'd ordered and were eating when the hostess came over and told us that we were no longer in the "bar area" and that these seats had to be assigned at the hostess station.  She was incredibly rude and pretentious.The food and the atmosphere are no were near as appealing as RA. The Happy Hour menu was not as extensive and the food wasn't all that great.  We never went back.~~#~0
Blegh, blegh, blegh. I will never ever ever eat here, or at any Sonic for that matter ever again after what I experienced. I ordered food through the drive through and got awful customer service. Then when I returned home, my order was completely wrong! I was the only person there at the time so it isn't liked they mixed my order with some one elses. Something told me to check the sandwhich and when I did, THERE WAS A HAIR!!!!!!!! I almost threw up. I will never revisit any Sonic chain ever again, which is sad because Ocean Waters were my favorite. DO NOT EAT HERE.~~#~0
I haven't been here in a while and tonight decided to drop in as I was craving a burger and a beer. The indoor bar area was full so I went and sat at the outdoor bar. I sat for 15 minutes and a server or bar tender never came outside. There were other patrons out there that had food and drinks so I wasn't alone. I got tired of waiting and went and sat in the off track betting area. The sign at the front had read 'seat yourself' so I didn't feel the need to go inform a hostess where I was sitting. Once again the section was totally ignored for around 15 minutes. At this point I was pissed off and didn't want to give them my service this evening. For that I can't rate any higher than 1 star since I wasn't even acknowledged. It'll probably be a while before I go back again. South Phoenix is in desperate need of another sports bar to compete with this place.~~#~0
Sucks. You can't even order cheese enchiladas, only chicken, which essentially means it is all pre-made.  So the chef is really just a master of the microwave. Seriously. You have to drop $5 for chips and salsa, and those aren't even good enough to be free. Avoid this place, there are tons better Mexican choices in Scottsdale, some within less than a mile.~~#~0
I'm almost positive this is the worst hotel in the world. Maybe 2nd worst. Let's see, I loved the 3 hours of sleep I got on their horrible mattress. I loved reading in the "vista lounge" with music blaring so loud I couldn't hear myself think. I could understand the music if there was any sort of nightlife or bar but it was dead every night. The number I heard from one bellhop was 28% occupancy. The 24 hour "fitness center" is a joke with 3 1980's tredmills, a few free weights and a grand total of 2 benches. Of course for  a mere $20 a day you can use the spa fitness center and even if you don't pay up they'll try to sneak it onto your bill (along with another 12.95 (plus tax) a day for internet!) Finally I found the desk staff and particularly the manager to be very unfriendly. The bellhops and valets were stand up but the manager failed to rectify any of the numerous complaints my party and I had. It was also lovely to spend 90 minutes getting them to remove the numerous false charges they had added including two mini-bar charges when i refused the mini bar key upon check-in. I wish I could have a week of my life back.~~#~0
Maybe one day I'll come back and hopefully have something nicer to say.  The one star (especially since zero isn't an option on Yelp) is for the atmosphere, I guess.  I came here for a drink with some friends because we had a half hour to kill before our dinner reservation down the street.  Plenty of time to get a drink, right?  Wrong.  After 20 minutes we still hadn't received our drinks.  The place wasn't even that busy.  After a brief discussion about the ethics of canceling the order so late in the game versus missing our reservation, we decided to cancel it.  We definitely made the right choice, because it turned out the waitress still hadn't even put our order in.~~#~0
My family and I went to brunch there on Sunday late morning. The place was pretty empty except for the bar that was full. Nice enough place. Been here for late night but never for Brunch. Well the food took almost 40 minutes to come out. The bacon was mooing. It was disgusting. I almost had to tackle the waiter to get his attention. Very very expensive for a I don't really care attitude by all who work there.~~#~0
Sorry, but I HATE this pathetic place! usually full of total losers, yet it gets pretty crowded. Poor phoenix, people just don't know better in this city. It's kinda sad, actually. Then when an a super cool & totally fun Event comes to Club STRATUS on 23rd Ave near Grand, hardly anyone goes! It's way better, more modern & no rif-raf losers. It is more 'Circuit party-ish", which Phoenix lacks, otherwise, you would have to leave the damn state to attend a Circuit Party Event, which is pretty much nonexistent in AZ.~~#~0
RUN AWAY FROM DOING BUSINESS HERE! I'll start by saying I never write reviews but felt the need to post my experience for other future consumers.  I brought in a set of high-end dress shirts and when picking them up two had STAINS THAT WERE NOT THERE BEFORE!!!  It took the owner a week to call me back and he said they would attempt to fix the stains.  I picked them up the next day and there were two more stains on each shirt!!!!  I asked the owner how he suggest we fix this situation.  HE SAID, "MY MACHINES DID NOT DO THIS!!"  He argued with me and refused to do anything for two $70 dress shirts of mine.  DO NOT ENGAGE WITH THIS DRY CLEANER.~~#~0
Ride to HELL, negative 5 stars, ever fly to phoenix with no air conditioning and only one operating bathroom and lineups down the isle? An old mother tried to pick fight with me as we tried to get off, I ignored her as we all were suffocating in hundred degree heat waiting on the tarmack with no oxygen. I am lucky to be alive. My husband rode AW to LV one way and wanted to buy another ticket with another airline going home even though the company paid for his ticket, he was amazed he made it home alive, I made sure I paid more for United instead of flying with him on the same flight.~~#~0
Let me just say I was warned about the mediocre hair styles, but my own experience solely with customer service guarantee's that I'll never try again.Convenient - yesPrices - reasonableCustomer service - HORRIDI called to make an appointment, same day (the latest one available) at 6:15. **First off just know when you're calling, you're not getting the salon you're getting some call center that makes appointments for you.** SO, I knew I wouldn't make it there til about 6:25 because of my class schedule, so I decided to pop by and let them know I'd be a little late.  The receptionists reaction, was almost like "how dare you", and told me they closed promptly at 7 since they need the full 45 minutes.  My response to this was "so you just put down all styling tools and leave at 7?" ... no.  She informed me that she couldn't CHANGE the time of the appointment, but she'll put a note in letting the stylist know.A few hours go by and I get a call from the salon.  "Hi this is [soandso] and I see that you can't make it here til 6:30, so did you want to reschedule?"  No I want a style tonight for a reason, you dumb broad... and again reiterated my question of them just stopping what they're doing at 7 at the same time my mind is racking at why is this SUCHHHHH a big deal??? The phone call lasted about 3 minutes of me asking a question and her just repeating that they close at 7. Was a talking to a robot??I was pissed, so I canceled and hung up.My overall impression is that a fiery hair dragon comes at 7:01PM and if anyone is still working it will breathe fire destroying everything in site and that's scary.~~#~0
Unquestionably the biggest Yelp let down ever!I had a pepperoni pizza and it was just plain flavorless. The pepperoni and sauce was the delicious flavor of a good old water. Yum! (not).I've never been so disappointed in a well reviewed Yelp establishment ever! Let's hope this is the first and last time!(you'd be MUCH better served by Cibo, Pizza A Metro or Spinatos ... all within the vicinity)~~#~0
Ok. So this was my second trip there.  The first time was early on a Tuesday about a year ago, and I remember it being somewhat enjoyable. This time was about 2pm on a Sunday.We wait about 5 mins for a table even though there seems to be plenty of seating.First of all, our waitress must have been stoned.  For her sake I hope she was not naturally that slow.  We had plenty of time to look over our menus since there seemed to be only 2 people working.  After telling her my order, included what I wanted as side, she informs me I have a choice of side and tells me my options. "Like I said, I'll have the bacon."No water offered to start off with, had to request some water.  No refills offered for our tea. WTF? Who sees a visibly empty glass on a table and does not offer a refill.  The drink glass was tiny too.  Like juice-cup style.The bacon sucked so bad.  Hard, thin, no flavor (maybe I'm spoiled from Matt's) The portions were small.  The waitress look flustered and although she was cute and trendy looking, I don't go out to eat for trend watching.I had the Sweet Potato pancakes.  She forgot the maple syrup.  Had to wait like 10 mins for her to come around so I could flag her down to bring some.The "toast" was cold hard bread.  The crust was so hard it hurt my mouth.The people around us seemed to be having a nice time.  Meanwhile I'm sitting there kinda disgusted actually with how everything is going down.  Maybe we were being discriminated against because we didnt get all spiffied up to go to brunch? I had time to speculate...The only positive thing I can say was that it was a beautiful day outside and they had an impressive tea selection.I got the impression this place put more emphasis on looking "cool and hip" on paper than good service and execution.If you want to have long conversations, browse periodicals, being outside on a nice day, and be seen this might be the place for you.If you want prompt service, generous yummy portions, keen waitstaff that recognize you exist and the money you are about to drop there goes towards their paycheck, not the best choice.~~#~0
Your kidding right? I guess this place is cool if your drunk, but they local soup kitchen has a better menu.~~#~0
Worst Apt I have ever lived at! I have lived at Aventerra for almost 18 months. Since I moved in it has gotten worse and worse. Aventerra has changed owners multiple times and now is owned by the bank. There has been at least 3 management companies that have run this place. My mail box was broken in to multiple times and it took management 2 months to fix it. Since the bank took over ownership Management has been letting anyone move in. The people that live below me are the most ghetto people I have met. They scream and fight all hours of the night. This has been reported to Management and to the Police. Nothing ever is done. Avoid this place!!!~~#~0
I'll start from the beginning.I was in no frame of mind to deal with what was about to happen.  I was on my way to return the 6th phone in 18 months that had been covered under a Best Buy service plan.  I had picked up my "new" refurbished phone the day before, and the "new" phone had a damaged speaker. When my Mom tried to call me, I couldn't understand anything she was saying through the metallic static.  I've stayed calm and collected every trip into Best Buy, knowing that it's not the sales associate fault that they replace one faulty phone with another.I walked in, I'm sure they could tell I was upset.  A sales associate recognized me from the previous phone issue and asked what was up.  I told him, I just received my replacement phone, the 6th one, and asked if there was anything more that could be done.  He said that there wasn't.  He stated that it could go into service an unlimited amount of times and nothing would be done.  When he said that, I did say, "so they are going to replace one sh**y phone with another sh**y phone?"  In which he replied yes.I just looked down in disbelief and said, "Well, send it out; again, I can't be without a phone."  The Mobile manager started helping, got the process started but then walked away, leaving me sitting there with no clue what was going on.  Finally, another associate came over and asked where he went, he didn't even know.  He sat down and stared at the computer, confused on what was going on and why I was left there.  I'm getting more upset, it's clear they aren't there to help me by then.He had no clue what to do, calls over another employee, who calls over another.  By the time they start the process back up; there will be 5 employees  gathered around the screen in front of me.This is where I started a spiral into my depression.They started making jokes and comments about seeing my social security number, something that gives me high amounts of anxiety.  They continue looking and making jokes back in forth between each other until one person decides they can't figure out how to do a task that is done multiple times everyday. So, they call over another employee.  I'm panicked. Are they really able to see all my information?  They finally figure it out, I have no clue how long it took, but it was a very long time.  They grab my loaner phone and instantly begin cracking jokes about it.  Telling me that I should be embarrassed to be seen with it, and telling me to hide it so no one can see.  Clearly seeing that I was upset, head down, on the verge of breaking down, I felt like I couldn't take anymore.He tries to activate the loaner phone, and it won't activate, he tries over and over again, it's just not happening.  He finally calls someone and gets codes to turn it on, after a very long time.  I just keep thinking to myself, it's almost done, I'll be okay.Just then the Mobile manager comes back, and the attention is taken back away from my issue. Instead, they would rather discuss the schedule in front of me.  I try hard to smile and hang in there through the entire process so far.They activate the loaner phone and I thought, "hooray, I made it".  Then the Mobile manager states "Maybe the 8th times a charm", and they both start laughing.  Seeing how upset I was, I feel that was incredibly inappropriate thing to say.  This is the VERY IMPORTANT part, to me.Without me knowing, without my consent, the worker takes a picture of me, as I was looking down with tears in my eyes, and places it as the background of my loaner phone.  He laughs and hands it to me.  As I looked at the screen, I could feel myself sinking into depression, quick.He says we are done, so I gather up my things and leave the building fighting off tears.I get home, try to text someone, and there are no contacts.  It was my understanding that you are supposed to get a loaner phone, equivalent to the one you turned in.  (ex. Android for an Android)  I'm so depressed that my wife calls the store and speaks with the store manager, tells her the story, and my wife is told that there is nothing that can be done about the situation.The Store Manager calls back some time later and the people who created the issue wanted to apologize to me.  I said, "Why would I want to talk to them ever again, they crushed me, I want the District Managers number."  She gave it to me.I call the District Manager, who informs me that the store manager had already called him, and told him that the person claimed to be my friend.  I told him that I knew his first name and that was all.  He then started talking about how much he appreciated my business, he knew about how I use to work for the company, and thanked me.  Telling me everything I wanted to hear to calm me down as much as possible before he went into a sales pitch.  Telling me, they would look at when the phone contract expired, saying he would find out how much money I would get back for trading my phone back because I participated in the Bu~~#~0
I regret ever going to this Vet, I only went there because of the positive reviews, but now question if the positive reviews are actual clients.  Their main goal is to make $ off their clients, not the actual well being of your animal.  Constantly trying to push insurance policies, wanting to do unnecessary blood work, only guaranteeing their bordatella vaccine for 6 months - every vet I've been to has guaranteed for a year, and then I had one dog die (within hours) after receiving the bordatella, and the other dog actually got kennel cough within a few months. $$$$$ is all this vet cares about, after the death of our dog, we found another vet, couldn't be happier, and they did agree the blood work was TOTALLY unnecessary since we'd just had it done within the last  year.  Oh and wanted to do vaccines when they hadn't expired yet.  Again $$$$$$$$$$ is all they care about.~~#~0
Food-wise, I think this place may have deserved 2 stars. I'm from the Bay Area, and the Thai food there is delicious!The coconut soup wasn't what i expected-- the taste was okay, though a bit watery. I liked the lemongrass in it.  then we had Rama's Favorite, which was basically beef with peanut sauce. more like peanut butter-- the peanut was overpowering. the WORST part was the food poisoning-- both my fiance and i subsequently got vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea. i even had to bring him to the ER, it was so bad. I see Thai Basil is generally well reviewed here on Yelp, so maybe it was just an off day? but just warning you-- something we ate there was bad, and I think it was the Rama's Favorite.~~#~0
The staff was friendly. That's about the only thing that was good about this place.The frozen yogurt was not good. The people working there also didn't know what active cultures were. There was also hardly any seating inside the place.We will not be returning, especially since there are so many other great frozen yogurt places in Scottsdale.~~#~0
I went to this place based on reviews and either I have really good taste buds or the other reviews were written by people who haven't experienced great food before.  This was AWEFUL. My sandwich was slim on the turkey, brown edges on my limp lettuce and the bread must have been 2 or 3 days old, it kept falling apart.  Now i appreciate everyone's take on potato salad theirs was horrible.  Cut potato, undercooked with I believe to be a mayo with seasoning?  When service is better than food.  That's bad.  Speaking of service, sitting at my table waiting for a server to take my drink order, i was able to read the entire menu but when i have to ask for a refill on my tea from the hostess, that's bad.  I have a pending charge from this restaurant for 8.50 more than my receipt since i tip in cash.  They better hope that the total matches my receipt or heads will roll. Will not visit again~~#~0
Don't go!!!  Tony's WAS the best shoe repair.  There are NEW owners who can not be trusted.  You have to pay in advance and their prices have really gone WAY UP!  They give you a little 'pink card' with your number as a receipt.  If you don't have your little pink card - good luck!!  They have no way of finding your shoes.  Their work is POOR, they are rude and their prices are crazy.  The good reviews for Tony's are old - NOT for these new owners.~~#~0
Hate this Subway!! Pam has got to be the dumbest manager since she just does not know how to run a restaurant. The employees always overcharge, have to be corrected and some of them are as dumb as the manager about the regular pricing and the deals going on! Not the new deals that subway comes up with mind you, but the basic meal-time deals, etc. UGHHH!!! Did I mention that I hate and boycott this particular Subway?~~#~0
Bad, just bad.Food is underwhelming. My friend did not like her wine after one sip and asked the waiter to exchange it for something else. He actually balked and said he would have to check with the manager before he could do that. What???Are you kidding me? Big mistake. Then I tasted my incredibly weak margherita, all sweet, horrible. Yea, they sell you an 18oz. drink, but whats the point if it sucks. Decided not to deal with the bartender directly instead of flustering our waiter again. Walked up to the bar and in a very calm, and nice way explained to the bartender that I was underwhelmed with my drink, that it was too sweet and I could not taste a hint of tequila. Well I guess tha was an insult, and instead of dealing with me as a customer, she told me that she made the drink and there was basically nothing wrong with it and nothing she could do. Really?This is the type of badly run, corporate restaurant I cannot stand. No owners to deal with, no one that cares, just crappy service and a culture that forgets about the customer. Owners need to go into a Houston's and see how a large corporate restaurant should be run.~~#~0
We got take out from here, not expecting the best Chinese food in the world, but we were not expecting to get the worst! We did not like what we got at all. My white rice had a metallic taste to it, and the crab ragoons were very seafood-ish. I got a beef chow mien. The beef was ok but not great and we also got sesame chicken and they were very crunchy with little sauce. I would not recommend Chinese food from here!~~#~0
STAY AWAY, spend your money else where. This place wrote the book on bad costumer service. Went there with the family and kids, and they had $10 cover, even for the kids, for a pay per view event. You could get food credit, so there were really trying to make sure you spent $10 per person. But the boneheaded manager would only accept cash to get in, and if you didn't have cash, you could use their ATM and pay a fee. They wouldn't accept a credit card, or even think of any alternative. So we didn't go in. So good luck in this economy, Mr. Buffalo Wild Wings owners, making do, with a crappy customer service approach and boneheaded manager. So we went to Elephant Bar instead and had a great meal.~~#~0
Second time this has happened to me.  waited thirty minutes just to get cold food. They need to start hiring more people at night! I saw my food on the county just chilling there until my cashier came from the other side ten minutes later!!!! SERIOUSLY MY FOOD WAS COLD! Never coming back at night ever. btw this was drive thru~~#~0
Went here for a company holiday dinner. Between the aweful service (45 minutes for a refill) the loud, obnoxious music, the dark atmosphere and the food that sounded amazing and was absolutely revolting (I personally took about four bites of one slice of 'pizza' and could not even tolerate to eat it. This is coming from someone who could eat a slice of dominos if needed. Thats how very bad it was.) The dessert we got, I believe peanut butter gelato was horrific. This place is for wanna be hip people. Its actually kind of sad.~~#~0
I would have to say ALL of the negative reviews here are true. I'm a SPG member and stay at many SPG hotels for work and play. I have stayed at the the W in San Diego, LA and Seattle many times and always had a good time. I had 10 people in town for business and fun for a weekend and booked rooms at the W Scottsdale (I do live in the Phoenix area). The attitude of the staff was unbelievable and very rude. It was so bad we left this hotel and stayed elsewhere leaving our rooms at the W empty while still paying for them.I will do the "I told you so dance" when this place shuts down. This review is just for The W in Scottsdale and not the others I have stayed at of any other SPG hotels I've stayed at.~~#~0
Looking at the last review, it must have been a "bad manager" weekend at Z Pizza. On Friday we ordered for delivery online. One hour later lukewarm pizzas arrived.  The order was wrong. Apparently they manually transfer the data from the online system into their ordering system and completely botched it.We caught the driver before he left and he said he'd to back right away and the manager would call to tell us how they'd make it right. Over an hour later, no call.   We called them and spent 20 minutes on the phone. We got no apology, just an excuse, "We're so busy. We've got 30 people in line. All businesses make mistakes."They offered to write down somewhere that we were owed a free pizza.  Seriously?! Like they'd proved their order system worked well enough for that. Very poor example of restaurant management and customer service.~~#~0
this location SUCKS!!! They never accept ANY coupons or participate in any promotions! Plus they are So rude.. And everything is super expensive! STAY AWAY. ZERO  stars!~~#~0
I just wanted to say out of all the hotels in the valley I chose Sheraton Wild Horse Pass for  me and my wife to stay the night and celebrate on the joyous occasion for New Years Eve.  It was very disturbing saying the very least when the fire alarm went off around 4 a.m. in our wing and immediately we jumped from a dead sleep.  As I proceeded into the hallway people were looking at each other saying is this a false alarm without knowing what to assume.  I personally felt systems should of been in place to where the management staff should of been there conveying whether to get out of the building or it is simply a false alarm.  Think we both can agree moments in a real fire can have serious and disastrous consequences.  After the alarm stopped we were way too alert to even thing about falling back to sleep so needless to say we left after 4:45 this morning.  Personally don't think it was worth the $166.88 when it pertains to personal safety.Do think out of all the casino hotels in the valley Talking Stick Resort is the best as well as being close to all the ammenities in Scottsdale.

Phoenix Sky Harbor, I've seen your plans for light rail connecting the terminals and the rental car center and they look glorious. 2015 can't come soon enough though --- the rental car center transportation (and the rental car center itself) as it is now is the worst I've seen.Why is it the worst you ask?- the shuttles from the terminal to the RCC and from the RCC to the terminals wait until they are mostly full to leave which means you could be sitting on the shuttle for 15 minutes before it even gets moving. Other airports have no problem keeping their shuttles in the move.- there are a lot early flights out of PHX (like get to the airport no later than 4am flights) and there are hardly any staff around at that time so everything us slower than usual. The last thing I want to do is get up even earlier to deal with that...- the garages are massive and not well signed... You keep driving and driving in it trying to leave or return your car thinking, did I miss it? Until 8 minutes later you see a sign with tiny lettering pointing you in the next direction.All I can say, fellow Yelpers, is that I wish you luck and recommend you build an extra 30-45 minutes if airport time into your trip if you're renting a car.The airport itself is fine. Not a huge airport, the food options are regular old airport food options. The baggage claim/ticketing/security areas are all fine. Nothing special or awesome but no real complaints. The nice thing about flying through PHX is that there are rarely flights delays due to weather!~~#~0
So we love OSF and have visited the downtown location many times. This location fell short of our expectations, I would not recommend you eat here and I will not repeat. If you want more details read on: Julie said that 1. It was my turn to change the diaper and 2. A family restaurant like OSF would most definitely have baby changing tables in the men's room. Well, if those exist they hide them well, I will mention that both the stalls were busy so I was not able to look in there for a changing table so I had to change him on the sink which was less than pleasant. Next, we sat about 40-60 feet away from the front door in large, red Alice in Wonderland type chairs. Although charming and comfortable, these chairs are little to tall for a short guy like me and my legs would not touch the floor! I had to do the slide-down-the-chair-to-touch-the-floor-so-I-feel-like-a-big-boy routine. Then I noticed that the first set of double doors from the outside were propped open so every time someone opened the inside set of double doors to walk in or out, a huge breeze of 39 degree F air would come rushing in and give us a great "Arctic" atmosphere. This bothered me enough to call Sean, our waiter, over. I explained the issue and he quickly went over to the hostess station where four girls with the apparent combined IQ of 50 argued with him for a few minutes and it seems that Sean lost the argument because the doors remained propped opened until about an hour later when a customer must have accidentally kicked the prop and made the outside doors close on his way out. Who is the genius that decided to prop them open in the first place with the kind of weather we were having? I ordered a Chicken Penne and Sean said that it came with a salad. The "salad" was just a bunch of lettuce in a puny bowl with some dressing. It left me wondering why we didn't just go to Olive Garden to get a real salad. Then came the bread. It tasted good but it was hard, cold and difficult to cut. Even little Ryan at 2.5 years old gave me a weird look when he tried biting into the bread. The bread came served in a puny cutting board which the more we cut the bread the more crumbs and hard crust went every were on the table and made a huge mess. I would recommend you bring some safety glasses and a cordless sawzall for this operation. I was not impressed. Why not send the bread pre-cut or in a plate more suited for this purpose? Hey how about sending FRESH bread out? The food came fast so I got my Chicken Penne and it was just OK, very unremarkable. Again, it left me wondering why we did not just drive a bit further and eat the Pene Rustica at Macaroni Grill which is a dish that deserves a standing ovation. The beer was tasty and the rest of the meal was enjoyable now that I was wearing my jacket fully zipped up and was starting to contemplate wearing my gloves also for good measure. IQ 50 girls were still giggling by the hostess station. Then I overheard three employees talking a few feet away from us by the terminal. They were discussing restaurant drama, something about "he almost got me fired but I apologized to the customer and still got a good tip" Now, let me tell you that besides being a patron, my extent of having any restaurant management experience involves working at Pizza Hut for two months as a waiter during summer break in college but even I know that discussing drama within earshot of customers is unprofessional and should be taken outside or in the kitchen. I began fantasizing about being "manager for a day" as I already had a list of the top ten things that this restaurant needed to address if it planned on staying in business. At this point in the meal I was looking around to see if I could determine who the Manger is and maybe call him or her over. Could it be the girl that was dressed in white, different from the other employees dressed in black? No, she was hanging out with IQ 50 girls for a long time, probably not. Julie also made an observation that they appeared to be waaayyy overstaffed. Julie worked in a restaurant as a lead where dollars sold per labor hour were the important to keep high for their bonuses. This was apparently not the focus here as there were loads of employees standing around and circulating the restaurant aimlessly carrying nothing and doing nothing. The positives: Sean was a great waiter, professional, courteous, prompt and was there just in the nick of time when needed. Sean is probably the greatest asset this company has going for it. For his sake, I hope Macaroni Grill is hiring as I think this restaurant is going under within the year. The building is nice, kept relatively clean and the music and ambiance is pleasant (besides the Arctic issue) But again I will not repeat.~~#~0
Avoid this place if you have any food allergies at all. Ordered for my child, who is allergic to tree nuts, a "classic" french toast, he started eating it and said it was spicy. Found out it had pecans mixed in the bread ! It wasn't listed in the menu description, and the server said they make it with "whatever old bread they have lying around".We luckily treated the allergy in time with medication, but this is potentially very dangerous and simply unacceptable.~~#~0
Worst food... Chicken lettuce wraps taste like rotten fish. Took one bit a spit it out! Even heard a kid at another table eating the same thing say, "mommy is there fish in this" dumplings were soggy and tasteless and the sauce had to much onion and oyster sauce. The vegetable chow mien is really just poorly made lo mien. Very runny sauce no flavor, did not taste fresh or properly prepared. To top it all off the bill was 24.50 an I gave her a 20 and a ten. She said "Ohh 50 cent an I do not have five maybe you just wait?" haha wait for what another table to leave? You are crazy!! I'm sticking to china chili...~~#~0
This place is terrible. The meat tasted like asshole.~~#~0
If I could give zero stars I would.  Why?  We never got our pizza!The night we found out we were having a baby we wanted to celebrate with a yummy pizza and decided to give this local joint a chance.We called and placed the order.  After 35 minutes we called and asked for a status update (This place was less than a mile away. What could be taking so long?) The clearly annoyed/annoying woman on the other end of the phone said that it was no longer in the computer so it must be on the way.  We waited, and waited, and waited some more.  So at the 50 minute mark we called again. We got the manager this time who happened to notice that our pizza was sitting right next to him on the counter (Our guess is that it was probably sitting there the first time we called too). He apologized , gave us a refund, and offered us a free pizza the next time we order.  Next time?  Uh, no, you ruined our evening.  No next time for you.~~#~0
Associated Dental does not back up their work when one of their dentists screws up and you suffer.  They are operated by a corporation that tries to keep costs as low as possible, and the result is that as a patient you get the short end of that stick.~~#~0
I've gone to In-N-Out Burger 3 times.  And each time I had to wait 20 min for my order.  Aside from that long wait the fries tasted weird. Weird in a gross way.  Third time was not the charm and I will NEVER go back!~~#~0
I also bought a Groupon. I called before the expiration date and they had a full voice mail that said they will discount their services for the amount I paid. What? That isn't a discount. When I emailed the company, they responded but blamed me for waiting too long. The fine print doesn't that services have to be completed by a certain date. I thought it was okay if I scheduled it by the expiration. I was fine with waiting, I just wanted to schedule it and not have to pay full price since I had already purchased the Groupon.I have requested a refund from Groupon and am carefully researching other companies to do quarterly service for us. These people have to enter your home, so it's not worth it to let someone into your residence who you you have to fight with to get them to do the right thing! In the future I will not purchase any service like this from Groupon without thoroughly researching the company first. If there isn't enough information on them to do that, just move on!~~#~0
Okay, so maybe I didn't learn my lesson well enough the first time I used this service. I needed to place a large order for our school.  Since I am not aware of any other grocery stores that delivery, I thought I'd give Safeway another try.   ABSOLUTE FAIL.   I placed my order on line, selected my delivery, specifically stated that there should be NO substitutions made to the order (this part was critical because these items would be given to small children/students, and I didn't want them receiving cookies and possibly items containing nuts, due to food allergies, etc).   Once my order was placed, I paid, and selected my delivery window.  I never heard anything back from Safeway, so I assumed everything was fine.  The day of the delivery, the items arrived, almost half of the items had been substituted with things like fudge cookies, and I'd been shorted items.  I later found out that there were many granola bars containing nuts.  Fortunately, our teachers are very alert and one child who happened to have an allergy to nuts was given something else that day. I contacted Safeway and expressed my concern about their lack of customer service, also reminding them that this is the second time I have tried to use their service and the second time it has failed.  The gal on the other end of the phone offered no apology for substituting and short changing me of  items, and instead told me that it was my responsibility to know which store the delivery was coming from and to contact that store directly to make sure they had the requested items in stock.   REALLY, HOW THE HECK AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHAT STORE THIS WOULD BE SENT FROM, FOR ALL I KNOW, I THOUGHT THESE WERE COMING FROM  YOUR MAIN WAREHOUSE!!!???    SAFEWAY, IS THIS WHAT YOU CALL CUSTOMER SERVICE???!!!~~#~0
So I finally tried Fridays,NEVER AGAIN!My husband and I wanted to go w/ our kids to Pappadeux but the wait was 45 minutes and as any parent knows,that is agony having to wait that long with 2 hungry children.SO since Fridays is next door and we had never been before we head over.We were seated right away and got our drinks quickly,my husband ordered a Jack and Coke which was all Jack with barely any pop in it.Now my husband likes drink but his was waaay too strong he had to ask for a plain coke just to balance it out.                    For our entree's I ordered the petite filet and salmon.I asked for my filet to be cooked medium rare,what I got was a fully cooked excuse for meat.I took 2 bites and had to spit out the the 3rd,I couldn't take it anymore.The salmon was overcooked and had no flavor.        My husband ordered the Friday signature cheese burger,he ordered it well done and it was still really pink in the middle.Now normally we would have sent it back but after seeing one of the waitresses giving another customer major attitude,about her food not being cooked right and then complaining that it tasted funny when she got it back we decided not to risk it.Overall the service was okay but the food made me wish I had stayed home and had a bowl of Cocoa Puffs.Next time you see a sign for T.G.I Fridays step on the gas and get away as fast your car will take you!~~#~0
Pretty much had a similar experience with Michael M. They're not interested in what YOU want, they're interested in what they can sell you. Yeah, decided to take my single speed Langster in to get the front chain ring replaced (w/ 46t I bought online off course). Brought a several extra chain links just in case they need it, but no, they guy said it's going to WEAKEN the whole thing. Just replace it, it's ONLY 10 bucks. I was like, you have black chain? He's like, nope, only silver and looked at me as if, dude, what's the big deal? New chain = winner! I declined and whatever. Got the bike back and got some extras that I didn't request. They adjusted my rear brake tension and it's not even remotely close to my front, changed the height of my seat post and yeah, didn't pump up my tires.Nevertheless, Landis = FAIL.~~#~0
Just finished breakfast and I have stomach ache. Had eggs benedict. First off the wait was terrible, 40 mins is crazy. secondly it took another 40 mins for our food to come out. Third the 3 of us had Benedict's, my eggs were runny and the other 2 plates the eggs were hard. Terrible chef for the plates to be that inconsistent. Overall recommendation, don't ever go here!~~#~0
Sushi Eye started out friendly where one could get to know the management and get a sense of family, however it has taken a severe downturn for the worst. I would not recommend this business for my friends, family, or even people I was not fond of. There are numerous other Sushi establishments where you can take your business and get the treatment you deserve with your hard earned money.I have to say that I never thought I would give a restaurant one star unless I was so unimpressed or insulted by the eatery that I have to just alert others.~~#~0
I've used Yelp many times, but never posted a review til now. The food we received from Rudy's BBQ made me sign up for a Yelp account to post because it was so terrible!  After hearing about this place I assumed we would give it a try as we like BBQ and it is close to our house.  It is clearly overrated!  My husband did take out since we have a 2 year old and going out to eat lately is near impossible.  He had to wait in line for at least 20 minutes on a Sunday evening.  We both ordered brisket sandwiches.  When I unwrapped my sandwich it looked great with a lot of meat, that is until I took the bun off to add sauce.  There was so much fat on this sandwich, more fat than actual meat.  I took a picture of it because I was so disgusted.  My husband said that he even asked for extra lean meat.  After pulling out the fat I ate most of the sandwich.  The meat wasn't great, a little dry.  I ended up eating my 2 year old's Costco chicken nuggets which were way better than the sandwich!  We will stick with Joe's BBQ, Tom's BBQ, and Famous Daves!~~#~0
Mind you - if my fiance could pick his last meal, it would be a torta - hands down.Los Reyes de la Torta?  Overhyped and under delivered.We ordered to go, so maybe if we actually ate there, it would've been better?  Regardless, that shouldn't be the case anyway.  The food was horrible.We ordered the Tortas Del Rey.  The thing is huge, I'll give them that.  BUT it was DRY and lacked flavor.  It had all the bells and whistles.  Unfortunately, the last time I checked bells and whistles (as well as the kitchen sink) don't have flavor.  Neither did this torta. My fiance is Mexican, and well- we know what a torta should taste like.  This was nowhere close to that.  Not even reaching substandard levels.  Came with chips.  It was to go, so why do they pack the chips in the same container with the hot torta.  Soggy chips!  Yeay, what a treat.  I ordered their king porkchop.  The spice was definitely there, but that was it.  Just a burning sensation in your mouth.  No other flavor.  The porkchop was dry as can be and severely overcooked.  It was like eating cardboard.  Rice and beans weren't seasoned.  Seriously?  And service?  Abysmal.  These girls working the front counter and "serving" have got a lot to learn.  What a disappointment.~~#~0
We booked the Hermosa Hideaway package with a King bed for New Year's Eve 2007. Our troubles began upon check in. We checked in and were shown to our room and were immediately surprised and upset to find a Queen sized bed and no fireplace. A week prior to our stay, we specifically emailed the hotel to inquire about fireplaces. We received a timely response ensuring us that ALL rooms at The Hermosa Inn had fireplaces. We immediately voiced our concerns to the front desk, and we were given the option of changing to what we believe is a "Rancho" room. This one did have a King bed and fireplace, but we had to move our belongings ourselves across the property. The second room was better, but it was annoying and inconvenient to change rooms at a hotel when paying $400+ a night. It should have been correct the first time. Furthermore, someone at this hotel is incompetent if they are informing guests that all rooms have fireplaces when that is clearly not the case. Two other small details that were unacceptable given the price: the remote control for the main room's TV in the initial room did not work. Secondly, the chocolate strawberries that we were presented were pretty nonchalantly thrown on a plate. Again, not that big of a deal, but for the price, the presentation should have been exemplary. We settled into our new room and enjoyed our champagne. Around 6:00pm we both became hungry, and we inquired as to what options were available. We asked about room service and/or appetizers in the bar. We were informed that no such food was available; because it was New Year's Eve, there was not room service and the dining room was only fixing the fixed menu meal. We understand that New Year's Eve is a holiday, but such a holiday should not incapacitate and overwhelm the kitchen to the point that no other food is available. What if we hadn't planned on eating in the restaurant that night? It's not like it is mandatory for guests to dine at Lon's. It was 6:00pm and we had 9:30pm dinner reservations since that is all that was available. We were hungry and had been drinking champagne, so leaving the property was not an option. No one thought to offer us even bread, which was clearly available since it was served at dinner. We then called back a second time to find out if the restaurant might be able to figure something out if we were sitting in the bar, and the person on the phone was very rude and hurried and said that if we came to the bar that "someone might be able to figure something out for you" but they were very "busy" at the moment. This is really atrocious at a hotel that calls itself "a luxury boutique." When we returned from dinner we had not gotten turn down service (it is the principle of this fact that bugs us). No one had removed the leaky champagne bucket either.Our poor stay wrapped up in the morning when we went to check out and perhaps get breakfast. There was one guest complaining about something when we arrived in the lobby, so the person at the front desk left to try to find the maintenance person and help that guest. The front desk then stayed unattended for 10 minutes (while the phone rang off the hook and others of us waited patiently). The maintenance person finally appeared and proceeded to get into a "discussion" with the person at the front desk while we were checking out - this totally interrupted us paying our HUGE bill and was unprofessional to say the least.  We couldn't believe that the front desk person and maintenance person would carry on that unprofessionally and tactlessly while guests waited in the lobby. Before we left, we asked if breakfast was available (which had been advertised and promoted in our package), and we were informed that "if you go in there right now they will probably still be able to help you." We were miffed that we "might" get helped for breakfast at 10:00am when it was supposedly included in our package.Overall, the main issue with The Hermosa Inn (and Lon's) is that it is way overpriced for the service offered. Our bill wasn't even adjusted for the cheaper room we ultimately stayed in. We spent more at The Hermosa Inn in less than 24 hours than we spent in 2 nights at a luxury hotel on Vancouver Island with all 3 meals included. The service there was amazing, impeccable and attentive and set the standard for what luxury means. Luxury does not mean telling guests that all rooms have fireplaces when they do not. Luxury does not mean telling guests that no food is available until dinner at 9:30pm. Luxury does not mean leaving the front desk unattended. Luxury certainly does not mean maintenance people and front desk people arguing in front of guests, and luxury does not mean telling guests that breakfast "might" be available if they hurry. A traveler has not had a good experience at your property if they wished they would have just stayed home for the night. The property is quaint and pretty, though, so it has much potential.~~#~0
GAP (Great American Picnic) was a greatly reduced event from previous years. Ridiculous security checking everyones ID so they could drink. I have gray hair and am well over 50. Did they think I was under 21? I think not. The food was dull and expensive. Mostly Mexican and beer. Ho hum. No chic or trendy places. Well maybe Stingray sushi is. It had better be, since they wanted $3 for one segment of a sushi roll. When I saw the stingy portion (oh, maybe I have the name wrong. Maybe it is Stingy sushi?) I asked for my money back. I planned to buy $40 worth of tickets. I had trouble spending $10 because the choices were so dull.~~#~0
ok so i LOVE Slices.... but the one in Tempe Marketplace stinks... everytime i go in there, they are rude. I prefer the one on 6th - they are so much more chill there and the atmosphere is cooler.~~#~0
I just went here with my daughter.  It got good reviews from everyone, so figured I would give it a try.  I was especially excited when I heard it had a good chili rellano burrito.   So that's what I got, and Megan got a carne asada quesadilla.  First, the help.  I stood there for at least 3 minutes, no one at the counter, and the people in the back just looked at me.  Finally, someone came up to help me.  Towards the end of my order, her personal cell phone rang.  And I kid you not, while she was waiting on a customer, she answered it and began to talk.  I couldn't believe it.  But I figured if the food was good, we would give it a try anyway.  So we went to find a table.  We sat down and I was afraid the wobbly chair under me was going to collapse.  I moved twice before I felt comfortable.  That's a lawsuit waiting to happen.   In the meantime, helped myself to the salsa bar, which isn't bad, give that 3 stars.  The food came out in a timely manner.  My chili rellano burrito had rice in it.  Now, I don't like rice in my burritos, but that's also easy to overlook.  But the rice had PEAS in it.  I kid you not, PEAS, and lots of them.  I hate peas, hate them.  So as I begin to eat, I picked them out, one by one.  The egg coating on the rellano seemed like it was hours old, it was spongy, greasy,  so peeled most of that off too.  And it was very hot, obviously had been heated up in a microwave.    Megan's carne asada quesadilla wasn't too bad, but the meat also seemed like it had been sitting around for quite a while.  All in all, a horrible experience.  There's a Taco Bell right next door.  I would have preferred that, any day of the week.  Needless to say, someone could buy my dinner for me and I wouldn't go back to this nasty ass place.  Rude front counter people, old nasty food, and chairs in the dining room that are ready to collapse.  It was clean...I guess that's something.~~#~0
Love Hooters, great reputation nationwide. The one in downtown Phoenix is unfortunate for the business. Most of the regular girls look sickly or are likely using meth judging by skin conditions and lack of composure.  Their boyfriends are seen often hanging out, giving jealous looks, yelling their names across the establishment, demanding constant attention, demanding free food or drink and these girls have no problem with being distracted from customers by them. I believe the best time to arrive here is lunch time or during major sporting events when the girls are motivated to work for a large crowd while their boyfriends are asleep at home or make themselves scarce.~~#~0
I'm surprised at the existing reviews. I am reviewing on yelp for the first time specifically because we thought this was the worst sushi place ever.  Yucky rice, tepid salmon in chunks when I ordered spicy salmon. the chicken katsu was horrible.   I will agree with others that the place is clean and service ok. maybe we just expect good Japanese food in a sushi place.~~#~0
The ambience was superb! I ordered the Chicken Mole.  It was so salty that I could only take a couple of bites.  My husband ordered the Taquitos which had no flavor.  The service was mediocre.  Probably won't return.~~#~0
Read reviews and was told by coworkers how good this place was. Will never go back in my life. The waitress was 93 years old and rude as they come. She was pulling the menu out of my wifes hand as she was still ordering. My wife asked for green onions with her eggs and was told flat out NO. Then I asked for one of their signature pancakes and was told they were out. No apology or anything. Then was told they could make a small one. I should have went with my instinct and got up and went somewhere who valued their customers.  I ended up staying and waiting for the food.  It finally came and was disgusting.  My wifes eggs were over cooked and had no flavor.  My signature pancake was like eating a sugar coated sponge.  I couldnt even finish it nor did I want to.  This was the first and only place I have eaten at that I didnt leave a tip. I would have given a negative tip if I could have.  Will never go back.  Dont come here unless you like to be treated like crap and fed the same.~~#~0
I didn't think this place lived up to what it's known for.... BURGERS!It was suppose to be this great place to have burgers, we get there to find only three burgers on the menu... kind of a let down. And they weren't anything special. Not to mention it was very dark inside. The only cool thing about it was that the fries came in this tiny grocery cart shaped baskets...~~#~0
I got food poisoning from the Lamb Vindaloo, the naan was hard and tough and we ordered one mild and two medium dishes and all were pretty hot. The lamb (which I have just about everywhere) was pretty tough too and not that great, so I only ate half. Good thing because the food poisoning may have been worse... Avoid! Service was good though.~~#~0
Plain and simple.  Service was the worst - Had to ask for refills on water - had to go to the bar to get our table of 8 another drink from the bar.  The waiter disappeared for 15 to 20 minutes at a time - food was cold, portions were very small.  I felt bad because we were celebrating a good friends B-day and it was not a good experience.  To say the least I will never go back.....bye Eddie's!~~#~0
The customer service that I received today was atrocious.  I was returning a product that I purchased, still in the package with the receipt and was treated very poorly due to the return.  The associate argued with me about the size of the item (a harness) and stated his disbelief that it would not fit.  After my store credit is spent, I will not return.~~#~0
Tried to get my oil change and tires rotated on my truck here today, but I decided against it because apparently one of their jacks is broken. That means that they only have one jack, which is being used all the time, which means that its probably about to break as well.  It's definitely not going to be my truck that falls to the ground when this jack breaks.  I also went to another Jiffy Lube near by on Broadway and Rural, same story.   If Jiffy Lubes can't keep their tools updated and fixed, how can their mechanics be performing up to par on my beloved 'Yota?  Eek! Methinks NOT.~~#~0
I had the italian beef from Al's and am not impressed at all.  It seemed bland, even with the hot peppers and cheese added.Top the medoicre food off with the fact that my credit card started having charges pop up on it from gas stations in Chicago days after I ate here (I don't travel there and don't even know anyone who lives there).Contacted the credit card company, contacted the police, and will NEVER, NEVER, NEVER eat here again.  I would prefer starvation.  I won't mention the name of the other location, but there is another restaurant in the immediate area that serves italian beef that is infinitely better and won't steal your credit card number, go there instead.~~#~0
Yuck yuck yuck... I can't believe this place has good reviews.  It must be because a majority of the reviews are written by people who stop here after a night out of drinking.  The other night I was craving some Mexican food and instead of going to the other Mexican joint that's less than a block away, I decided to try Amados.  Big mistake.... huge.  Sure, it's open 24 hours but, so is the competitor around the corner... and they offer tasty food!My chicken chimichanga plate was gross on a buncha levels,  First off, it's obvious the oil hadn't been changed in a while because I could SMELL the deep-fried tortilla... and not in a good way.  After a test bite or two, I decided I'd just eat the chicken inside but, it was SOOO SALTY that I literally ended up throwing most of it out.  I have never ever done that to a chimichanga before.  :(  Finally, the beans and rice had almost no flavor.  I don't even know how that's possible... rice sure.  Beans tho?!  Because of the 4 stars I was thinking I should give it another try but honestly, just can't stomach the idea of it.  Won't see ya there!~~#~0
I thought it was the worst Mongolian Stir Fry I have ever eaten.  I love Mongolian food.   I was expecting more asian flavor.  It had more like a BBQ flavor.  I didn't care for the service.  I found the servers were trying too hard.  I thought they were extremely annoying.  I do like when they ask if need I something but not everytime I take a bite.  I would never go back mainly because of the service.  I want to be leff alone and enjoy my meal.  Don't try to upsale every single thing on the menu.  It seemed like to me the waiters and waitresses were forced to do this.  If they didn't they would be canned.  I didn't like the atmosphere either.  It was like sports grill/ asian.  Just odd.  Another stupid Corp American type restaurant.  Don't waste your money on this place!!!!~~#~0
They use hydrogenated oils by the truck load, nothing more to say but I will go on. The food is eh and the portions are huge. Is it really necessary to add a billion grms of fat in everything, especially Genetically Modified oils that are completely unneeded. If your food is any bit fresh than get that gross trans fat out of thereYour service is soo to fyi~~#~0
Sort of a combination of a bar/diner type of place. For cheap beer, television and maybe ok fried appetizers & sides this is an ok choice if you are in the area but if you are looking for decent food probably not, at least  based on my sandwich.  The garden veggies sandwich was basically cold bread, with a cold small mushroom that had been sauteed at some point and sliced in to 4 or 5 thin slices a with a ton of pepper sprinkled on it, a piece of cold tomato, lettuce and avocado that must have just come out of the freezer because it was a slush, I literally bit through ice. The fries as a side were ok but for an $8 sandwich it was very lacking.  Can't vouch for the rest of the menu so maybe some of the other choices are decent but the one I had makes me think whoever was "cooking" just throws simple things together without much thought into what they might taste like. Even a simple warming of the bread would have been nice. I hope some other people try it out to see if other parts of the menu are ok - or try the bar- they have a happy hour special before 7pm and after 10pm that includes half price drinks and appetizers.  Happy that there's a non-chain option in this spot of Chandler but very disappointed in the quality of food.~~#~0
I went to Chicago, fell in love with deep dish and PRAYED to find something here. after searching and searching, I found this place and i saw the great reviews and was so excited!I ordered the large cheese deep dish.DISGUSTING! the crust is soft and bready. In chicago, the crust is crunchy and flaky. the sauce tasted like articial canned sauce. In chicago, the sauce tastes like they just mashed up some fresh tomatoes.I could probably get frozen deep dish from wal mart that would taste better.~~#~0
I rarely take the time out of my day to submit reviews, this one deserved my attention. Today was strike 3 at this location, will never return in the future. On top of the fact that they are very pushy, talk over you and fail to listen to what you want rather than what they want to sell you, the service is awful.Today I brought my car in for a hand wash service. After waiting for 30 minutes I went over and checked on my car. It had been sitting there the entire time and had not been attended to. I was not told that there was a wait for this service and it was clear that there was some miscommunication going on in the back of the house. When I asked for a refund I was told I had to wait until they decided if they were going to refund my money. The cashier was out of her element and rambling on to herself, did not get a sense of confidence from her or anyone on staff when I was in the shop. I received a refund and left the store.I had brought my CL 500 there a couple of months ago for a full detail, what I got instead was a super car wash at best, the technicians overlooked so many things that I doubt that the car was even detailed.If you are going to be as pushy as they are, they ought to be able to back it up with great service.~~#~0
Don't be fooled, the place looks nice on the outside and is decent on the inside but the staff and insect problem are absolutely horrible. I have lived here for 6 months and have seen a total of five scorpions inside my apartment and I live on the third floor. I've asked maintenance to come spray several times and there still seems to be a huge insect problem. There are always ants by the pool and even the occasional javelina will sneak up on you. I would never renew my lease at this disgusting place.~~#~0
I live close to this place and they open early for hangover breakfast and have delicious pancakes and AMAZING onion rings. My boyfriend and I like to devour onion rings as early as possible in the morning and these are amazing and conveniently located. But: the service is AWFUL. WORST SERVICE EVER. even when we are the first customers there in the morning, the waitresses sit in a booth and watch TV and never come back. when its medium crowded, the waitresses disappear. when its overcrowded, they never come back. they dont pay attention to who walks in first... so if you walk in and sit down farther from a table being served, the waitress will skip you and go serve the person who is closest to her (but walked in 10 minutes after you). my boyfriend and I joke that we have an abusive relationship with hazelwoods. we are like beaten wives -- going back because we love the onion rings, but knowing we are going to get treated awfully.one time i asked for a vinegarette and received raspberry walnut vinegarette and had an allergic reaciton (nut allergy). the waitress never came back to bring us our check.ive had to get up many times to find the waitress on slow, empty days to pay the check.the last three times we've been we have walked out before being served because we've waited over 10 minutes in a moderately empty restaurant or the waitress has served someone who came in after us first. sometimes you will sit for 20 minutes without acknowledgement our menus.the management is NEVER THERE. its like no one is running the ship.~~#~0
Had lunch there today with my daughter, there was us and another table of people in the place.  My daughter ordered the Rotisserie chicken which was dry and not that good.  I had the chicken and dumplings which were Ok, but not great.  We ordered the roasted vegetables and which were a mismash of strange vegetables which I'm pretty sure were steamed not roasted.  I would not recommend this place to any one.~~#~0
While the atmosphere is good the food is about the worst that I have had and the service wasn't exceptional. Both meals were nothing but fat and when we complained our waitress agreed with us but made no offer to exchange for something else or to take them off the bill (and this isn't a cheap place). Our waitress did pass my comments on to the manager who was sitting across from us but he just shrugged his shoulders. Not to be recommended.~~#~0
Just went to try this place for lunch and it is no longer open :( looks like it went out of business.~~#~0
I cannot fathom why anyone thinks this is good thai....nothing fresh about anything we ate, and in fact, I was sick (literally) after eating here. Guess I"m spoiled from eating authentic thai in Hawaii all the time, but this is a big thumbs down.Lukewarm spring rolls, a soup that was not close to hot, and miss-the-mark entree's...me no likey....~~#~0
Try it if you like e-Coli poisoning and a evening spent on or near the toilet. The Pozole has the taste and texture of a barbecued sock, and comes with a side of salmonella. In the interest of fairness the guacamole was good and the service was decent.~~#~0
Worst.experience.ever.I totally agree with Lou on this...totally overpriced and crappy selection. I also bought a Groupon here and also felt like I didn't get a deal at all because the prices were so high. They didn't even have Malibu Red?! Which I have been wanting to try for awhile now.I also felt skeeved out by the location. Like, I fully expected to see racks of porn when I walked in (thanks heavens I did not). And they bag their stuff in black garbage like bags, probably for the purpose of concealment. Obviously this place is for the clueless binge drinking college student.The customer service was awful. When I asked about a particular vodka, the guy behind the counter condescendingly responded that he only drinks top shelf so he wouldn't know, snicker. Really? Apparently only the best for the dude in the stained t-shirt and a fu man chu. Plus, he could clearly see my husband and I were having trouble making a decision - no offer to help us out, no recommendations. And they either didn't carry what I wanted, or were out of it.Ugh. Awful. I will never go back. People, stick with Total Wine.~~#~0
I didn't get a chance to try the food here but Yelp won't let me post a review without any stars so I choose one because I looked forward to trying this restaurant but when I got there I couldn't go inside because they have a "no firearms" sign posted prominently . Since both of us in our party take our own personal safety seriously by carrying concealed firearms we went somewhere else to eat. Good way to turn away customers but at least we discovered Pita Jungle, the food there was great and no silly "No Firearms" signs to turn away law abiding customers. Seriously, do you think a person intent on robbery or mayhem would heed those signs?~~#~0
Picked up my last pizza Oder today from Streets of NY.  They told me the order would take 25 minutes.  I was there in 20.  What I got was a cold over cooked pizza with very well done wings.  I asked for an extra blue cheese for the wings and was told it would be an extra 50 cents.  Never had to pay before.  Not a good sign when only about four tables with people for dinner at 7pm.  They need to go back to New York to see how it's done.  Too bad, it used to be a good place.~~#~0
It is were possible to give this restaurant zero stars, I would. I have been here 4 times in the past year in the hope that the service would improve.  I had first tried Taylor's several years ago and remember the food being good, but having very bad service. We recently moved close to the restaurant and are looking for a locally-owned breakfast place.  I am not usually such an optimist, but the local is right by our house. The menu is very large and the food has always been fine, nothing great, but the service absolutely terrible.  Not bad, terrible. Every time. All four times.  The wait staff is incredibly slow to take orders, bring drinks and food, and worst of all, after serving food, never check back to see if you need anything or offer drink refills. I cannot tolerate such poor service and will not return.  Trust me, you can find a better breakfast or lunch place.~~#~0
Snippy waitress. Ran out of bruschetta and caprece salad. Caesar salad was warm shredded lettuce (apparently including iceberg) and tomatoes with some sort of non garlic dressing that was barely able to be tasted. That is not a Caesar salad.  Flatbread came without being cut into manageable slices and crumbled all over the place. Was told the bruschetta would have been made on facacio ??? bread  if they had any. That is not bruschetta.  My companions ordered shared salad and flatbread which arrived without sharing plates.  The kitchen was slow and the wait staff insufferable. The chef is obviously very high on himself.  I was embarrassed to have taken my visiting relative there.~~#~0
CLOSED AS OF 9 APRIL 2012~~#~0
We were on vacation so my family went here expecting a great French meal after reading the great reviews. The atmosphere was great, but the food was totally not the level of French food we were used too. We love froie gras so we ordered the poulet roti. The breast was super dry and there was no froie gras at all. The steak frites was very tough with no sauce and the bouillabaisse had no saffron in it. The best item we ate was the plat de fromage. All in all a very disappointing French meal. We love food and this one place we will never come back to.~~#~0
This is an incredibly beautiful property, it is just huge.  It is built against a rocky hill and is surrounded by the golf course.  We stayed in one of the Casitas in the lower part of the property.  All day long starting at 5am there are buses, trucks and maintenance carts driving by.  The noise is deafening.  At no time during the day was it relaxing.  It also seems that they could cut there maintenance staff by at least 30%.  WHY do they need all those people that look like they are doing nothing except driving around being super loud!!  Now let's talk about how housekeeping yells to there fellow cleaners constantly throughout there cleaning effort, while one is downstairs the one upstairs is yelling for something, asking questions.  HEY!!  I am still in my room trying to sleep or work or rest!! SHUT UP!  Won't be back.  This is for conventions where the guests are gone all day or you are wasting your money.~~#~0
Read the reviews, had high hopes. Ordered 2 fish tacos. Not bad, but not good enough for me to seek them out again. The tortillas were really good! Also had an order of jalapeño poppers, not worth the $6 I paid for them. Didn't even finish them. They were hard and again just nothing special. Probably won't go back here, but I love Mexican so I can't say never! Lol. Just wasn't impressed at all and was wondering why it was so highly rated.~~#~0
I like the way my review got flagged! If you don't like people giving your business bad reviews, do better business. The people here are rude and it's not a nice salon atmosphere. No one wants to pay money and let someone mess with their hair when they've been treated like crap. Maybe you can squeeze that into your business model and you wont have so many issues.~~#~0
In response to CLYDE, I am an internist, and fully comprehend and am able to diagnose the difference between flu and food poisoning.Too bad the health department didn't swing in on SUN.  They would have had a field day with your place.And I seriously doubt they were there on MON anyhow.  I think you're merely trying to cover your tracks from yet another health department violation.For those interested, here are a list of the health department violations from this place:http://maricopa.gov/envsvc/envwebapp/tabs/results.aspx?navigatedFrom=inspectionResultsDrillDown&in_insp_id=1484680&cat=02&type=01That's 10 violations in one inspection alone.  Yeesh.RESPONSE TO CLYDE:LOL!  Perhaps if your restaurant spent this much time in safe food handling, you wouldn't have so many people complaining about sanitation.You have some great excuses,and I know you'd like to think they're valid.  I have never known a soul that works at your place.  Nice try, however.And linking the TRUTH about your restaurant is not slander.  Please educate yourself on the meaning of the word to begin with.  ;)I do hope you know, the more you continue to lamely attempt to refute my claim of food poisoning, you make yourself and your restaurant look even worse.  Since you've started posting, I've received over 25 emails from viewers of the review thanking me for my honesty, and blasting you for making yourself look foolish by your petty responses to a customer.  I'm sure you are aware your nasty approach here only supports others claims of the management and staff being surly and bitter.  Or, maybe you're not.  ;)So, do feel free to try and attack me and discredit me further.  I'm not the one with a filty dirty restaurant (and accompanying violation record) that's making people ill and losing customers, and I'm not the manager who is creating an even bigger PR problem for himself.  Have at it!  ;)~~#~0
Seriously to be avoided at all costs. The folks at this dealership are the stereo type of sleazy car dealers. My husband and I stopped by early in the afternoon, we were greeted by a saleswoman named Dee, who was courteous. We said we would return later that day, no problem. Unfortunately when we returned Dee was busy with another customer, apparently she is the only person at this dealership that works. We were instead handed over to a hefty man who did not introduce himself. We asked for the price on a blue Mazda sitting right out front to which he replied "Well which one, we've got a ton of blue Mazda's". Wrong my friend, you have one, its that bright beacon of blue in front of these big glass doors, but OK whatever. We walk over to the car where he tells me that the 96 ford Taurus on the lot would be a better match for me. Great, well, I'm asking about this car, not that beater. Finally he agrees to tell us the price of the Mazda, and we ask to talk prices about it and a truck for my husband. When we go inside he walks into the fishbowl with his sleazy manager and they both come out and tell us they wont tell us prices on the cars until they run our credit. We say we wont give them our information until we know whether or not we can afford the price of the cars, and they proceed to tell us its federal law. BS. We told them bye, and I called 2 other dealerships to confirm the crazy story they were telling us. I called back and asked to speak to a manager. I got the sleazeball, and told him that I was very upset by the poor service and the lies I was being told. He said he really didn't care, because that's how they run their dealership. Well, my friend, if that's how you run it I'm sorry to tell you, you wont be running it long. And he refused to give me his supervisors number, but don't worry, ill find it.~~#~0
Gross is the one word that comes to mind when I think of where we had my nieces 3rd birthday party. This location has to be the dirtiest, stickiest, worn down place I've ever been into. Which is pretty sad since it's for children. A lot of the games and rides didn't work. The customer service there was awful. They didn't even remove our dirty plates after we ate our pizza, we had to put them on the table next to ours and they were sitting there as we left. All of the animated animals or whatever you'd call them looked like sad, worn out, crackheads with lazy and/or unopened eyes as they danced/flailed around. The place didn't even do anything for the birthday girl. No Chuck E walking around, no ticket booth, no happy birthday song, pure crap.They really need to close down for a few days, clean and sanitize the entire place, fix the broken games and rides and have a "how to treat customers" seminar. I DO NOT recmommend this location.~~#~0
Ah, back in the day this used to be THE place to go.  Went back this summer at it was so over.  The bar scene was lame.  The rooms were loud.  The pool was overrun with the worst element of Scottsdale.  I hear they are totally renovating the place... or already have?  I won't be stopping by to find out.~~#~0
My young children love Panda Express orange chicken. They eat it 2-4 times a month. We were at the mall on a Saturday afternoon and stopped into the food court to have lunch. The kids ordered the orange chicken and happily started to eat. To our surprise, it was spicy. I noticed the color was a bit dark compared to normal but then I realized they must have mistakenly made it wrong. They were adamant it was made correctly and wouldnt provide a refund. It was completely inedible for my kids we had to throw it away and get them some pizza. We're still deciding whether we'll be returning to any Panda Express but certainly never again to this one.~~#~0
This is a great place to go...  but only if you like being treated poorly by staff while they grossly overcharge you.I like to support local business so I kept giving them chance after chance but I'm to the point where I prefer to order stuff from B&H or take the 1.5 hour drive down to Photoworks in Tucson rather than deal with them (and they're only 2 blocks from my home).~~#~0
What a joke. Worst service I think I've ever received. I feel bad for the owners of such an awful establishment. We went because reviews on yelp. Awful. Vegetables weren't cooked all the way through. We were one of 3 tables and had to wait 30 minutes for food. We all ate cereal at home it was so bad. Cold, not cooked, no flavor. Shame on Susie.~~#~0
Flo's "Asian" Kitchen...?  Where is the Asian food?  The food had no flavor whatsoever!  It makes the ultra gross chain restaurant PF Changs seem like Asian food in my opinion.  Not to mention this "Asian" restaurant is extremely overpriced!  I know this is Scottsdale, but come on.  Makes me miss California more and more...~~#~0
I am honestly baffled that this horrible place has so many good reviews. I will never eat here again. I'm just glad we only bought 1 of the restaurant.com coupons.First off, they picked just about the worst place to have their restaurant, there's no parking at all. We had about a 30 minute wait, which wasn't too bad for a Friday evening. There was a mix up and they tried to seat the same party twice, when we told them those people had already been seated they made us feel like we were lying just to get the table. Between that and the parking we were all already pretty annoyed. Once we were seated we got our drinks pretty quickly, but for the rest of the night we had to flag some one down to get refills. We decided what we were getting but we weren't sure if they wanted us to mark it down on the paper menus they give you (since we've been to some places that just use them as menus and don't like you writing on them) the waitress finally came back, when we started to tell her what we wanted she was like "Oh, you have to fill that out" and left, didn't even give us a pen or anything. She didn't show up again for at least another 10 minutes and another waiter had taken pity on us (he was also the one who we usually ended up asking to get our refills) and taken our order. Now to the food! We got 2 orders of Gyoza, they were pretty good but very soggy. Not just in a non-fried way, but more a fried and then left in water for a while kind of texture, it was rather off-putting. They didn't get our second order of Gyoza out until we'd finished our rolls. Our friends ordered chicken fried rice and a Philly roll, they said both were good but they'd had better. My husband and I ordered a shrimp tempura roll, a las vegas roll and a haha roll. The tempura had been overcooked and they actually had the nerve to make the bottom half of the roll a double layer of rice and seaweed! The haha roll was mediocre at best. The las vegas roll was actually very good but we had to scarf it down because they'd forgotten to make it for us (we didn't see a waiter for at least 20 minutes after they dropped off the food) and we were late for a movie. They're just very cheap, they only give you 5 piece rolls and they use seriously huge pieces of cucumber and carrots so they can skimp on more expensive ingredients. I assume they do this because they offer all you can eat and because they're one of the only sushi places here that do that people apparently are content to let them get away with it. In areas where all you can eat is something you find in almost every sushi restaurant (Nevada) this is so not acceptable.  I imagine that the all you can eat option is the only reason they've stayed in business as I know of a few other sushi joints that are much, much better within a 15 minute drive. I'd rather pay more and have really good sushi and great service than put up with this place just for the all you can eat option.~~#~0
A new experience, in the end it was nasty, sauces were bland, and had massive diarrhea after wards. RATING: GARBAGE!~~#~0
Hi Lux!  Your business hours on your website and on Google list your hours of operation on Friday and Saturday as being open until 2am.  After a play this evening at the Herberger, we decided to find a place to grab some coffee and hang out and were so happy when we checked online and saw that you should be open late.  Unfortunately, we were turned away when we tried to order because it was 10pm and you guys were closing, even though there were several dozen other people hanging around inside and outside enjoying coffee, working on laptops, chatting, etc.  It looks like Yelp is the only place that is listing your correct hours of business.  You might want to change that. Thanks!~~#~0
So I've eaten at this restaurant before. However, the other night we had a guest in from out of town and an event earlier in the evening. So we booked a reservation at this restaurant, WHICH THEY CONFIRMED.When we walked into the restruant the place wasn't very busy and the greeter informed us that our reservation wasn't going to be honored, but, we were welcome to order a drink at the bar.  Because it was already after 9 at that point we had a difficult time finding a place that could accommodate us on such short notice. Interestingly we didn't even have the latest reserved seating they were offering, there was one or two even later. I eat out and entertain a lot for business and personal.  I rarely write totally negative reviews. But, Not honoring a reservation that a restaurant has not only taken but, have CONFIRMED just because the staff is lazy and wants to go home is completely unacceptable and shows a general lack of customer service and care for the client.I do agree with an earlier reviewer.. If you want seafood go to mccormicks and schmicks or for a more local flare, The Salt Cellar.~~#~0
I can't believe the rating on this crappy place... The pizza reminded me of the crap they would sell at a bowling ally or roller rink. Plus Ottos is cheap 50 cents for refills. I ate 2 slices of my medium pizza now I am going to give it to some homeless person or I shouldn't put them thru the torture...~~#~0
OMG this location is nasty. I went to this walmart for the first time and was the last time. Being that I just moved to the area and this is the closest walmart I was excited going in w/ high hopes but as I started walking in from the parking lot I noticed the parking lot was unmaintained. I walked in and noticed the people who work there, they were just deeply staring at me like they never seen a women before and made me feel really uncomfortable. As I was shopping I noticed this walmart isn't very big compared to the avarage supercenter so I got what I needed and as I was checking out the cashiers were very unprofessional, didn't know what they were doing and felt the vibe like they just didn't care about their job. I now go the extra mile to go the better cleaner walmart instead of this one.~~#~0
I had been looking forward to trying Camus' successor for a couple of months, and finally go the chance to on recent Friday night.We had a large group of about 12 or 15, five or so of which arrived about 15 minutes early. So we ordered drinks in the bar area which had some seemingly graffiti-type art that seemed totally out of place in this hip, downtown hotel lounge/restaurant. We mentioned in passing to a waitress that we were here to give someone a head's up and she looked physically sick as she sighed, "Oh, you're the large party? Yeah, I have you." Well, that's not the way to start things off, that's for sure.I totally felt for her - at first. Large groups are very intimidating to serve. Except... the rest of the restaurant was virtually empty. I could go into a laundry list of things she messed up, forgot or simply did not know, but I think J-Man S. already pointed most of them out for us (and that was only our side of the table...)So, on to the food. I was *starving* so I ordered a bowl of $4 miso soup to hold me over until my burger arrived (had I been less starved, I would have ordered the tofu curry or been more adventurous, but all I could think about was grilled animal flesh). Ok, so it took about 40 minutes to get the apps out - seriously? Anyway, I thought RA had, hands down, the worst miso soup, but this place takes the cake. Yeah, it's only 4 bucks, but I was *so* bummed when it finally came out that it was lukewarm and had the consistency of gravy, was flavorless and had not a single vegetable or piece of tofu in it. REALLY?!After an extended conversation with the server about the cheeses offered for the burgers, mine still came out cheese-less...sigh. I had to *send it back* even though I knew it would take anywhere from 15 to 45 minutes for the corrected meal to come out (her average time for fixing her many, many screw ups). Once I finally had my plate, I found that the fries were shockingly still hot - and pretty damn good, too. Too bad the "house fries" that were supposed to be a mix of sweet potato and regular were all regular save for two. The burger was also pretty good...but to give a back-handed compliment, burgers are hard to mess up and at that point, the napkins looked delicious.I did sample Bonnie's tofu curry and thought it was pretty good - the tofu was crispy and the curry sauce seemed flavorful...but I don't trust my opinion at this point because I might have eaten anything. The serving of chicken teriyaki could have fit in a tuna can - sad, sad, sad.On top of that, after an unsatisfying meal, I trekked to the bathroom. I was surprised to find it was filthy and completely out of paper towels and soap. Iiiickkkk. Now that's just unacceptable for a place that charges $12 for a drink. You couldn't pay me to go back to C4 - if they can't even keep the bathrooms clean, I can't imagine what the bar or kitchen looks like.~~#~0
Used to be great, now there's a new owner. He smokes inside the store. Menu the same, but the portions are smaller. Sad, I won't go back.~~#~0
I lived in an apartment at Legacy Bungalows for an 8 month period in 2010/2011.  The apartments themselves are nice.  Our apartment was very large for a one bedroom and it had a nice open floor plan and high ceilings.  The grounds and pool area was always well maintained.  The location is convenient to downtown, once you walk past a few blocks of sketchiness.  The management was always very friendly and was quick to repair maintenance issues.  And to top it all off the rent was dirt cheap!So why would I not recommend the Legacy Bungalows?  Well that would be because of our fellow neighbors.  Many of the apartments are rented out as section 8/low income apartments, and it shows.  I should have been tipped off when I was signing my lease and I had to sign several documents saying I would not commit a crime or sell drugs in the apartment complex.  Some of the things I experienced while living there include being awoken at 6 am on a Sunday by someone trying to beat in my neighbors door with a baseball bat screaming, "I'm going to f-ing kill you b*tch!", people inside the dumpster rummaging through our trash several times a week, parking my car next to the most dumpy cars I've ever seen in my life, being asked several times if I "smoked" and if I wanted to buy some "weed", and having my door checked if it was unlocked by people who seem to be checking every door in the complex presumably to break in and steal things.  The door checking thing happens several times a week, making me paranoid that my door be locked at all times.  Until they stop renting to low income families and the surrounding area cleans up a little, I would avoid living here.~~#~0
decided to hit me with two months of dues when i moved.~~#~0
1 star is being generous after our last experience here.  Cant say enough great things about the bartender Josh, and servers Rachel and Darcy.... Its too bad that we wont get to experience their services because of the owner.  The owner may know how to light up an open sign, hire great employees, and set a great atmosphere... but she lacks class and needs to know what customer service stands for.  Im all about supporting small business and local businesses at that... but I will not support a classless piece of trash.  We were regulars there bringing in friends family and referring this place to anyone we could.  I will never go there again and dont think it is appropriate to treat customers the way she did us.  Not only did she eavesdrop on our quiet conversation, but then she butts in to tell us that we are being rude talking about how we disagree about her not advertising that only the 1st bottle is half off wine night but fails to tell us until after we have ordered 2 bottles.  Common courtesy would have been to tell us that the 2nd bottle is only $5  off when we ordered the 2nd bottle.... not wait til we question later and she wants to point to the menu stating the fine print says otherwise.  Im sorry, but i didnt look at a menu to look for the fine print when i see your Half off bottle wine night posted all over facebook.  But besides the fact,  after the disagreement, she proceeds to tell us that if we dont like it, we can leave.  Fair enough.....  let us finish our wine we bought and we will never be back.  She then threatens to call the cops if we dont leave that moment.  Unnecessary!  we werent causing a scene.  She made the scene on her own.  I will take my group of 7 that visits there 2-3 times a week and support another business.   In an economy like today, a business owner like herself should really take a step back and see where she will be if she continues to treat loyal customers and/or new customers like she did us.  I work with small business owners on a daily basis,,, and they arent successful by treating their customers rudely.  She should take this feedback as a gift.~~#~0
WhataBADburger.Couldabeenbetterburger.We came here on a quick stop before heading to our friends house and I remember the Texas Whataburger being so much better than this was!Soggy fries with no salt, and a smashed burger is what we ended up with. Sadness. Whataburger disappointment!~~#~0
I think this location is closed. Google maps says it is and the website only has a location in Scottsdale and Mesa listed.~~#~0
The service is typically bad and they didn't put the ASU football game on for us.~~#~0
OK, the reason why I am only giving it one star is because I know they closed and the signs says that Morning Squeeze is coming soon. However, I work VERY close to that place and haven't seen any activity other than the owners going in and out of the place a couple of times since it closed. The tables are still outside on the Patio, but the chairs are gone. I wondered what really happened? One of the guys that seemed to be associated  with JW's opened the Burger joint where the Philadelphia Sandwich Co. used to be. Well, if they are going to do something there, do it soon. Let's see if they can give The Breakfast Club a run for their money.~~#~0
I really did not give this bar much of a shot, but here goes my review anyway. A close internet friend of mine swears by the Saturday night karaoke here. So one Saturday night we decide to hit it up. Right away I am put off by the seating. I strongly prefer tall tables to booths for a bar setting, and most of the seating here is booths or low tables. The arrangement of the booths is very cramped and the place was really crowded so right away I was feeling a little claustrophobic. I only ordered one drink, rum and pineapple but it tasted INCREDIBLY bad, it was somehow both too strong and too sweet. It tasted like the pinnapple equivalent of grenadine was used. Nearly undrinkable. The karaoke host talked WAY too much in the 15 minute we were there. And 2 of the three songs we heard stopped half way through for no apparent reason. The deciding factor in our leaving (besides the friend we were hoping to meet not being there) was the INTENSELY creepy crowd. Creeps to tolerable strangers ratio was grim, I would say 20:1, and that is being generous, I don't recall seeing any tolerable strangers but I wasn't looking that hard. A very creepy old man maintained a very one sided conversation with my poor companion on the smoking patio and a very drunk girl tipped over stone bench and fell on her ass. All this was our cue to leave. We called a cab and escaped to our regular Saturday night karaoke up Dobson to Priceless Primetime. I guess I probably will give this place another shot, when I am more sure my friend will be there to show me what is to like about this place.~~#~0
I really don't like this gym for many of the same reasons other reviewers have given.  Old building, old broken equipment and machines, no sanitizers, small TVs that never waver from MSNBC and ESPN, uninspiring music selection over the speakers (sometimes TOO LOUD), employees that don't give a damn, etc.   The only reason I go here?  My husband likes it for the location (centrally located to work out with his buddies) and the racquetball courts.  I tell myself we're carpooling to save gas.  I'm sure these (along with the outdoor track and pool) are the only reasons why people bother to come to this gym.~~#~0
We've been to this restaurant many times.  This last visit was a new level of "we don't give a flip about service nor care if you ever come back".  Our party of 6 was served 2 tiny handfuls of chips in a basket, which we promptly decimated.  When our waiter finally ambled over to take our order, we asked for more chips.  Waited, waited...food was served, still no chips.  We requested more.  My order was supposed to come with sopapillas, I pointed out that they were missing.  Midway through the meal someone stopped by, we again mentioned we would like more chips, and the sopapillas that were part of the meal.  After 3 requests we finally got our chips.  Meal was finished, still no sopapillas.  Requested those 4 times!  Finally the waiter threw them on the table and left, no apology, nothing.Food was lukewarm; we were starving and knew that if we commented about the temperature we would never have eaten that night.Bill comes...not only do they charge $4 for the chips, but they tacked on 2 mystery people to the table, thus incurring an automatic 20% tip!  We requested to speak to the manager.  After waiting and waiting he finally came to the table.  We politely explained the whole situation (piss poor service, sneaking in a 20% tip to the bill).  All he says is "we'll take it off".  That's it!  He's was even more disinterested than the waiter!Don't eat here unless you want to experience horrible service, be overcharged, and want to wait around twiddling your thumbs.~~#~0
Christmas party at Greekfest. I had the steak and my wife had the salmon. I suppose it is possible that they were having a bad night but everything seemed nearly flavorless.None of it was good.The desert was about the only thing worth having.The atmosphere was great and the staff was helpful but they need to rework the kitchen if they want to stay in business.~~#~0
Although I can not vouch for the food, the service was horrendous!  I was with a group that called ahead for reservations 3 weeks in advance (18 for a bachelorette party).  Upon arrival we were put in a tiny corner on one couch and 15 fold out chairs....huddled around two small teak patio furniture side tables.  When politely confronting the manager on his staffs lack of communication to our party about the accommodations he got MAJOR attitude.  Not what I would expect from a "professional" who apparently "owns 3 restaurants".  We took our business elsewhere FAST!  Would NOT recommend this place for dinner...snacks maybe...but BEWARE of DIVA manager!!!~~#~0
me and my wife got the chicken burrito and it was tasteless,greasy and full of qrizzly~~#~0
Did not enjoy our lunch here.    Had to wait for a hostess to even come to the hostess stand to seat us.    The waitress took even longer.   This was on a Thursday at 2:30 in the afternoon.     It's not like it was a busy time.      Ordered the brie appetizer, wedge salad, fish and chips and shortrib.     The wedge was good but  the portion on the fish and chips was way too small.   Very poor quality cod.   My husband thinks he got some type of food poisoning from the short rib.   He was sick all night.    Would definitely not go back.    Also very expensive, not worth the money.~~#~0
So... My boyfriend and I found this place as one of the few (if not only) donut spots in Phoenix that's open 24/7. After he had a craving for donuts at 1AM, it had good reviews, and I saw on yelp that they served boba there, we decided to give it a go. When we got there, he first ordered a boba for me and began his dozen donuts order. The donuts he wanted (namely chocolate... Simple to make you would think) was not available at 1AM. He then asked for another type of donut (Boston cream)... Not available. Only ones they said they had at that time of night was glazed, raspberry filled, and lemon filled. He declined the donuts altogether because he was frustreated with continually getting "sorry, we don't have that".I gave this place a one star on his behalf and because I had my boba drink and it was descent, however, nowhere near the best I've tasted. I like my boba squishy and not too rough to chew. I tried boba at this one Viet restaraunt that was better but that's another yelp review in the making.Overall, case and point: we may have been better off going there earlier in the day and their selection seems to be EXTREMELY limited after typical business hours. If your business is said to be open 24 hours AND you're one of the only open available donut shops in the area that never close, PLEASE have a majority of your donut selection available around the clock. Thank you for reading this rant.~~#~0
I am not one to totally trash a business, because I understand that once in a while even the best run business can have a off night, but I can honestly say this was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had, and I have no problem at all posting my review. We went there for the "All you can eat fish Fry" only because we saw an ad and had coupons. While it was a buffet, it was not "all you can eat" as the food was not replenished enough. The food was cold, and they didn't have your typical "fish fry" dishes like cole slaw, french fries, mac and cheese. Instead there was a horrendous selection of lasagna, some sort of stuffed pork dish, stuffing, gravy and some sort of pudding item for dessert. On top of all that, the staff was rude. We had to wait for 5 minutes for the cashier, who when she finally cashed us out didn't ask us how the food was, or engage in any sort of pleasantries. Stay away from this join, far away.~~#~0
This place is a dump. The parking is atrocious and is the main reason why I will never attend a Cubs Spring Training game in Mesa. It took 45 minutes from Center Street and McKellips to park our car. As you are driving about 1 mile an hour or less for 45 minutes. The parking was next to a residential area that had a throng of people selling parking and two lines of cars slowly inching forward with no idea where the end was and no signage to give the paying fan a clue as to what was going on. I heard this banging on my car which I thought was some gang banger or some overzealous resident trying to sell parking. It turned out to be a parking attendant that had the balls to bang on my Mercedes. This is not a fawking rental car and do you think I was trying to get away without paying $5 bucks for parking? First of all get in the proper position where you can make eye contact with the driver and maybe you can jog and get the driver's attention before you go banging on someone's car. Remember, I am driving at less than one mile per hour.I think you get the point, I rather spend my money at a restaurant in Scottsdale or Phoenix instead of wasting any of my money at Hohokam Park.~~#~0
The parking lot is always super crowded. People need to be reminded that the red zone in front of the store is reserved for Fire trucks, paramedics, and law enforcement. I can't stand seeing people park in the red zone. Why doesn't security enforce this?? The employees at this store are also really rude and treat you like you're just a bother. Don't expect them to even say hello.~~#~0
As others, we wanted to check this out after the hype it got on the food network. Fun-looking place and good service but it is about the food after all.I had the chicken fried steak and subbed a cheddar jalapeño bisquit for the potato. The CFS was tough and stringy; so bad a cut if meat that I had to spit out in a napkin the last bite I could stand to eat. The meat flavor was non-existent. The breading just as bad. It lacked any approximation of seasoning and tasted like fried corn starch. The gravy was just as bland and the sausage buttons they added to it were pink and undercooked. The bisquit was undercooked and pasty inside. Sorry, it was just that awful.The other entre we tried was the chicken fried chicken with a waffle. Sad waffle. The sort of waffle that has so little rise to it that it didn't fill the iron and looked more like a waffle puddle. Flavorless as well. Ive had tastier toaster waffles. The CFC was dry and had the same starchy breading. We had to ask for butter and the waiter brough some and a small plate. He explained that the chicken was best eaten with sauce and proceeded to squirt syrup and hot sauce in the plate. It was better that way but nothing special. A bad day for the chef? Or just a bad chef. Hard to tell but we'll never be back.~~#~0
Frankly, who cares? Bad logo even from the start with lego-land Hopi coyote to the howling dog look now. Throw in indifferent teams and financial problems throughout, why was this team moved from Winnipeg in the first place.Also, retaining the whole "White Out" tradition in the playoffs is dumb. Sorry, but it didn't really work in Winnipeg (how many playoff rounds did they win in their NHL days?).Plus they don't even play in Phoenix anymore.~~#~0
if i could give this place less than one star i would.this place was horrible. i had a habenjero burger - i think they mixed the pepper with garlic. it wasn't spicy at all. the fries are also coated in garlic and ... i ate a good lot of them because they were bareable, but they were pretty damn gross. the house beers are lame.it was WAY over priced for food that didn't deserve to be on a Chili's menu.just please. go somewhere else.also, my girlfriend had a martini and there was a pit in the olive... that was a bit startling.. so, if you DO go, be prepared for that.~~#~0
Horrible service and my food was cold. If they had been busy, I MIGHT understand, seeing as I used to be a server myself. But we were the only people in the place. And considering that I've had such great experiences at other King's locations, I was very disappointed.~~#~0
Average food, however the worst part is the customer service.  I'd ordered food, and 'they' missed few items while handing over the packet. My bad, that i didn't check before paying. I reached home and called back reminding them about making the payment and the missing items. To my surprise, the lady who picked the phone started blaming and arguing with me that why did I leave the packet. ..Strange people... Secondly, I would agree to the review provided by 'Rahul K' , The owner of the shop is a frustrated man, and rough to his customers. He chews tobacco while mumbling and always feels like he is inconvinienced while you pay him cause he gets disturbed from watching his TV!~~#~0
Phone ordered, was told 10 to 15 mins to be ready to pick up.Went there and was ignored for all the time of waiting: 10 mins or so.Tried to be very patient and understandable 'cause I'm a nice dude.But, I realized that I was a customer that ordered THEIR food.My order was not started after I asked one of the staff who took my order on phone.  I'm a huge local biz supporter. Oh well, I won't be back.~~#~0
Ra is the worst place to go for sushi.~~#~0
I don't get the positive reviews here.  Ok, well... you walk in and think, "I've gone to Calorie Heaven!"  But then you sit down to eat and BLEEEEHHHH.  The only thing that we tried that was marginally ok was the fried rice and the orange chicken- but WAY sweet.  Most of the food was really not very warm- in fact barely warm and mostly tastless.  The egg drop soup was down right yucky and the beef/broccoli totally chewy.  The spring rolls were anything but fresh- obviously frozen and rewarmed which I expected, but they were barely warm.    The Chow mein seriously had no taste.  We only took one plateful and pretty much lost our appetite and left.  I really didn't expect much and figured it would be over sauced American Chinese and was actually up for that, but it was like what you'd expect in a really bad college or nursing home cafeteria.  We won't be back, but we wanted to like it for a splurge girls lunch out.  So sad.  And then the koi pond.  Um, koi like greenery, foliage... pop some lilypads in there at the very least.  It was like a tiled bathtub with fish in it.  I felt sorry for them and for us when we left. :-(~~#~0
Well we wont be back again. This place could be so cool but I don't really care for the menu and we have been unhappy with the food the last two times we have been and this last waitress sealed the deal for me. The waitress we had this time seem to be in la la  land. She forgot about comin back to take our dinner order after we ordered wings, she couldn't seem to finish her sentences, and really didn't seem to give a shit about us and she only had one other table. The chicken sandwich is not the same as the one I had the first time. This was a chicken breast with the fat still on it, totally untrimmed. Chicken fat in your mouth is the most disgusting thing ever. Also the bread was hard and it was not cause it was toasted to much it had dried out from sitting out un covered. Hard as a rock! They tried to tell me it was toasted but, lol, there was  no color at all, meaning not toasted, not dark, I hate being bull shitted, people make mistakes so just admit it don't bull shit me ass hole. I sent it back and did not get anything else. If these cooks here cant prep a chicken breast then who knows what else there doin back there, this is basics. My girlfriend got the grilled cheese and mac n cheese. Again bread not toasted, totally white and cheese not really melted. Um do these people know what a grilled cheese even is. Unreal. The bread was to thick for the amount of cheese. Imagine two pieces of texas thick sliced bread and one slice of cheese, lol this place is a joke. The mac and cheese is watery and no flavor. See ya Garage. If you cant make a grilled cheese, mac n cheese ,or a chicken sandwich that's even acceptable then forget it. I guess if you have a burger and wings here you may be happy that's it.~~#~0
Eaten there several times - been sick feeling after 3 of them. Not a clean place, service is slow and with the exception of a few beer specials the menu is overpriced ($8 for a dozen overcooked wings?) Had hope for them to get better after they remodeled about a year ago but I won't be giving them another chance.~~#~0
I think this place was more style of substance.  My husband and I could not find what we were looking for, and the menu was no where near what you would expect from a sushi restaurant , very limited selection with the rolls. And I would have expected better food than what we paid for.One other thing the hostess greeted us and told us that it would be a 15 min. wait to be seated in the restaurant, and that we should grab a drink at the bar.  As soon as we walked over to the bar I see a group leave some table, and tell my husband lets go there and sit and wait.  While waiting the waitress Victoria comes up and says that we could order dinner here too.  So that it what we did which was fine.  The only things is the hostess never came back to check up on us to see where we were.  I really think that's poor hostessing skills.~~#~0
Our us airways flight from Santa Barbara to Phoenix was on time, smooth, without delay and renewed my faith in the idea of flying versus driving, etc.   However, my return flight shook my faith in this mode of transportation. We arrived to check in at sky harbor only to be told that it was too late to check in.  Our flight was for 5:49pm. It was 5:10pm.  We were told by our eye-fluttering attendant typing at the keyboard with a fake smile that we needed to arrive at least 45 minutes prior to departure.  We lost are already paid for seats.  Resisting the urge to grab him by the neck and bang his head on the counter to see what would fall out, I politely asked for options which he responded with two: 1) wait until 9:00 pm to fly standby 2) or depart the next morning at 8:30am.  Not wanting to wait fora hours to see if we could board an oversold flight, we chose the latter option. When we arrived in the morning to a chaotic crowd of passengers, there was little direction by us airways employees.  Instead they only contributed to the chaos by giving vague directions.  They wouldn't last five minutes in my classroom.  Clearly some employee training is overdue here. When we finally checked ourselves in, we faced gates changes, delays due to maintenance, and an ever increasing amount if disgruntled travelers surrounding us.  I'm glad it's over.  No more US Airways.~~#~0
Service was painfully inadequate.  Waitress served everything at once (bread, salads, entrees), forgot the kids beverages, and forgot my side dishes.  I tried the Saturday special: chicken and rice, which was colorless and slopped on a plate, reminding me of prison food!  Since the waitress forgot the sides, it was a sad presentation, and served lukewarm.  No fresh fruit was available.  I always love the Cracker Barrel gift shop, hence the one star ...~~#~0
Tried to go but business is now closed.~~#~0
You just lost our business.. no longer open on Sundays is a very bad decision. Religion and business does not belong together.. seperate~~#~0
Let's get this straight. The ice cream was excellent. However, I had called to check the closing time and was told that it was 9pm. Although any information I could find on the internets said 10pm. OK, the internets are not always correct. My girlfriend and I walked up there and got there around 8pm. The sign on the door listed the closing time as 10pm. The front door was locked. We could see people entering through the back and enjoying ice cream inside so went around the back. A sign in marker was on the door saying that the food kitchen was closed and all we could get was ice cream. That was fine as that was all we desired.We entered and went to the hostess stand/'Please wait to be seated' sign. A staff member dressed in pink shirt came up and asked if we wished to be seated. We said yes and she grabbed some menus. There were many booths available. However, she led us to a half booth with ridiculously uncomfortable chairs on one side. I asked about sitting in the open booths and she explained that since they close at 9pm that section was closed. She gave us the menus and we seated ourselves on one side of the booth so as not to have to sit on the uncomfortable wire chairs. The menu stated clearly that closing time was 10pm.A waitress in a gray shirt came by and was very helpful as the menu is complicated, apparently dips are scoops (I thought dips were the liquid that went on the cone, that's a different place though), she explained the menu and then came back to take our order after a delay that was longer than I'd expect, they were busy though. During the interim I took a look around and noted that the 'open' seating area had filled. Now people were indeed being seated in the 'closed' area. The staff members seemed to be arrayed in pink, gray, and black (for the kitchen staff) except for one guy who seemed to be assisting in a flannel shirt and jeans. The customer seated behind me noted that he had received his sundae in a Styrofoam cup and that he remembered having them in glass previously. I did not know what he ordered. I knew that my single scoop with two toppings was costing $5.50, a Styrofoam cup would be insulting. Low and behold, our sundaes were delivered to the table in Styrofoam. The pictures I have seen also show glassware. This was very disappointing. I am not sure if the staff had simply decided to close early for the evening or if there was some kind of issue with the dishwasher...I don't know (and we were told nothing except closing time was 9pm) what was going on. The only thing I am sure of is that no matter how great the ice cream is, it is important to run a tight ship. I am not sure if there was a manager there, if there was they should be fired.  The night was 3/9/11. The ice cream was excellent.~~#~0
So this place is not a great place to take your kids for some ice cream .  I give the Ice cream four stars because its wonderful. The service gets three stars... not so great.  The food gets two stars...stay away from the turkey burger the meats gray and has no taste.  The daily special is your best bet if you are really hungry and cant wait to go someplace better.  The decor is nice and authentic for its time but I don't understand why it has an antique shop attached to it.  There isn't even a door separating the restaurant from a huge amount of vintage clothing.  Vintage cloths and kids with sticky fingers don't mix.  Of course my son wanted to look at all the vintage stuff and when he tried on an old hat (with my permission) an older woman(maybe the owner) yelled at him and told him " the vintage cloths are not for dress up".  I was going to buy the hat for him because I could tell that  he really liked it but if he cant even try it on I don't see the point.  We left the so called Ice Cream shop/Goodwill disappointed and a little angry that we had spent so much over $100 on food and ice cream for the family.  Even though this is an ice cream shop I wouldn't take your kids.~~#~0
Color me unimpressed.Anybody who knows me (and even some who don't) know that I love my beer. I consider myself a connoisseur, and have been called a beer snob on occasion (might have to do with my twitter handle.) With 54 taps and 500 bottles, this place certainly doesn't disappoint on the beer aspect. So why the 1 star, you might ask? With all of my high hopes for this place, it fell flat on its face in every aspect I feared it would. It was over crowded with far too little seating (we ended up standing). The music was loud enough that everybody had to practically shout and lean in towards each other to be heard. Then there was the service.Only one other time have I ever even considered walking out on a tab. It takes a lot to get me to that point. Now while we were greeted quickly, which sounds like a rarity, this was the only good portion of the service. While my own beer arrived within only about 5 minutes, my friend's beer waited under the tap for a good 10 minutes, completely forgotten about. Of course this was only after he was told twice that the other beers he wanted were no longer available, with 5 minute gaps between each of these. At this point we decided to finish our beers and be done with this place. Little did we know, this was no easy task. Getting near the end of our beers, our server asked if we would like another round and we said, "No we'd like to tab out." Simple enough. 20 minutes later, still no check. I managed to get the attention of our server again finally and held my credit card out toward her this time, hoping for a stronger hint. "Oh, would you like to tab out?"I am quite certain I will not be giving this place a second chance.~~#~0
My husband and I are new to Phoenix and have decided to try as many local places as possible. Intrigued by the outside decor, we ventured into this odd place. We ordered 2 meals and sat at a greasy, dirty table. Our wings and burger arrived and we were thoroughly disappointed. The wings (some spicy ranch and some garlic Parmesan) were soggy from the grease and extra chewy. The burger appeared to have been  put in the fryer with the wings. The bun was soggy and the patty doused in pepper. They did try to make their greasy food healthier by handing out sandwich bags with carrots and ranch. Good effort. The one star it gets is for decor and fries. The fries are great, just covered in salt (shake then it off and they will be fine.) The decor will keep you entertained and avoid awkward silences.~~#~0
Ahh Sun City: population who cares...the place you live to die.  This food is for the dying soul.  so if you're ready to go....itadakimasu! (japanese for bon appetite)~~#~0
Pure and utter dog poop. Asked for an "Anaheim Scramble" with some orange juice. The cashier told me they didn't have juice. I asked if they were out. She replied no, and that she even thought it was weird they didn't carry any juice being a breakfast place. My scramble comes out and the waitress who brings it to me looks at it oddly before serving it to me. I ask her why she looked at it that way. she said no reason. I insisted there would be some reason to eye my eggs like that. She showed me the eggs were under cooked and runny and returned it to the kitchen.What she brought back was some sort of Frankenstein's monster of a scramble with stale toast.  See picture for further reference.~~#~0
Over the last year, I've noticed a rapid decline in the quality of service at Rula Bula. It used to be my favorite place to wash away my college woes, but now I don't ever want to go back.On a Friday night in May I was out celebrating a friend's birthday with a group of 10-12 people. We were all ordering food, booze and overall having an excellent time. When time comes to mosey on home, the waitress informs me that my credit card has been lost. Problem #1: If a guest's credit card is lost, a manager should always come discuss this with the guest, not the server.The waitress, Maddie, was horrified and worried, and suggested I leave my phone number with her so if she found it she could call me. She also gave me a comped beer, which I later found out wasn't comped but a beer she paid for herself. True true to her word I received a phone call shortly after close that night. For a variety of reasons, I was unable to pick up my card for a few days. Because of this Rula Bula put a pending charge on my credit card for $25 because my card was "left overnight".Problem #2: management. In conversing with the manager via email, I received excuses, and was told several times that I was wrong about the credit card charges about which I complained, even after verifying them multiple times with my card company. In my emails I also listed several shortcomings I had noticed regarding the level of service, and received absolutely no input from the manager.There's no excuse for poor service, lost cards, non-comped drinks after such an egregious mistake, and no real apology. The managers really don't seem to care, which is an attitude that rubs off on many of the employees, save for Maddie. I'm sad to say goodbye to the best Guinness in town, but I simply can't keep justifying the poor service and lack of concern for customer satisfaction.~~#~0
Good food, bad service or actually no service.  We never saw the server after we ordered our food.  No water refills, wine that was ordered never arrived.  Also you have to get your clothes dry cleaned as the greasy smoke from the kitchen permeates the whole restaurant.~~#~0
Very bad experience here. Service was beyond bad and the sub was at best just average.~~#~0
Very over priced and not very high quality.~~#~0
The prices at this place are ridiculous. They charge $4.50 for 1 pancake and the quality is sub-standard, several tiers below grocery store pancake mix; in the category of a failed home cooking experiment. Even if I was a billionaire I couldn't eat here as it would entail a contradiction; you don't get what you pay for, plain and simple.  It's a sad state when the supply and demand market equilibrium of the Mesa restaurant economy allows this place to stay in business; perhaps people in Mesa, AZ have low culinary standards, but I think people should demand more for their money.~~#~0
Asked for an open and honest deal and they slapped on additional charges at signing.  I guess typical for a car dealership but it seemed like a overly shady financing department - buyer beware.  Haven't evaluated their service department yet.~~#~0
Awful.The selection still consists mostly of t-shirts from the 90s and out of style clothing. Yet, when I bring in my VERY RECENTLY purchased designer clothes to sell to them--- they take nothing. Hmmm... someone needs to take a second look at how they manage their inventory.Today I went there for the last time. I brought a never-worn Banana Republic cashmere sweater, T-bags dress, JCrew dress, and new CHLOE dress (among other very good, wintery items) that the girl at the counter didn't take. She was about 18 and obviously wasn't trained to recognize good merchandise!! That's just lost money for them... considering they mark up what they buy from you by about FOUR TIMES as much as what they gave you for it.I suggest My Sister's Closet.~~#~0
Very disappointing... expecially for the price.  I ordered a turkey sandwich, my husband the cheesesteak.  Our bill with a couple of sodas was $24.  Ouch!  The cheesesteak was pretty forgettable.  I would go to Uncle Sam's - theirs are much better.  The turkey sandwich was pretty awful.  The turkey had lots of dark meat and was finely shredded.  The texture reminded me of canned pet food.  I initially thought the sandwich had been made with tuna by mistake.  The too-sweet russian dresssing didn't help matters.  Save yourself some money and get a better sandwich at Jimmy John's.  Their service is much quicker, too.~~#~0
Sons of fucking bitches. Three orders of food and when we pulled up to the drive-thru window and asked to add a taco to the order, we were told by the young man working the drive-thru window that NO, there are no "extra" tacos, they are made to order. "Yeah, we want to order one." He then responded by saying we cannot add any food to our already existing order, and that if we wanted to add any food to the order that we would have to exit the drive-thru and drive back around and get back in line again. No joke, he said "no seriously, you can't order a taco. It's business, you understand." No, I don't understand. Your business is to sell me artery-clogging food, and you are refusing to do so? To top it off, when I called later to talk to the manager, a co-worker answered the phone giggling and then finally said "uhhh. EHH ... HELLO?" "Hi. Is this Jack in the Box?""Uhhh. YEAH." Looks like JITB needs to step it up on the employee training manual.~~#~0
This place needs improvements in so many areas! Our experience was very similar to some of the other reviews. We went there for breakfast on a Saturday morning. There was plenty of open tables when we got there, but we were still had to wait 10-15 minutes to get seated. The hostess explained to us that the cooks were 'catching up' on the orders and that's why we had to wait. When I asked if she could just seat us and take our order 10-15 min later, she looked completely confused and said, "uh...I...don't know...I was told not to seat anybody". So there was a bunch of other people just standing there, waiting, and you could see they getting frustrated by this too. We finally go seated and the waitress got our order, she was nice, but took a long time to come back after she took our drink order. We waited at least 20 minutes to get our food. When the food finally arrived, we were not impressed at all! My husband got the El Jefe Omelet, it looked soooo good on the menu, but he was very disappointed. We paid $8.50 for a below average omelet with 1 slice of toast. They charge extra for sides like home potatoes...most restaurant places we go to include the toast and potatoes with your meal, especially when you pay that much! So yeah, their prices are not the best, especially for the quality and quantity of food. I got the El Gallo Torta, and it was OK. We also paid $3 for 1 egg and a slide of toast for our son, and never got a refill on our coffee.This place has potential, I like their concept, but they need A LOT of improvement if they want to keep customers coming back. I know we won't be back after our disappointing experience.~~#~0
I won't be going back to this place.  I went here while waiting for my show to start at Stand Up Live, the comedy club next door that has the same owner.  There was a live band playing that was playing soooooo incredibly loud.  The place is only so big, but the band was playing like they were at Madison Square Garden.~~#~0
Have tried twice to visit this restaurant.  Never able to find parking.  Hopefully will be successful one day!~~#~0
I don't want to spend too much time on this restaurant. I've already wasted time eating there.Too salty! Too dry and too salty.I know you want more, but I've wiped it out of my mind.~~#~0
Mission not accomplished.....Let me start off by saying that I am not trying to trash this restaurant but I was not impressed by my experience that I had there the at all. I decided to check it out because of what the reviews said on yelp and ended up being a bit of a let down and that kind of makes me wonder if some of the Yelp reviews were done by family, employees or friends. I love to eat out and try to do so as often as I can (or cash flow allows), so me and girlfriend tried 2 apps with 2 main dishes trying to get a feel for the food and enjoy a good dinner. First, when we walk in the place it was very empty and it still took the hostess a bit long to seat us, why? I don't know. Second, we have a seat take a look at the menu and the server greets us (by the way nice server but kind of spacey) he takes are drink orders and recommends a few dishes. After a while we get our drinks but not the bottle of water that I wanted and paid for (it never got there) and the cocktails were imaginative but bland. To spare going into details the food was not bad, but just okay. After all the hype I was expecting more but honestly if I wanted great modern Mexican/Latin food I would definitely go somewhere else like - Mucho Gusto or Barrio Cafe ECT.... I think that what made me realize that I would not come back here is, when I felt the snotty and stuck up feel of this place when I responded to one of the employees about what I thought about my meal. I wasn't rude but said it was just okay but they made me feel like I was wrong for not loving it. The staff is a bit arrogant or at least similar to how this town seems to be and the prices reflect that... I am by no means cheap but $12+ drinks?, portions that don't match the prices(way over priced for what it is) call me what you like but I'll stick to great food and some what reasonable prices somewhere else. If the food were amazing the price wouldn't even be an issue i.e. Mastro's City Hall. Like I said earlier seems kind of odd that some people have given this place 5 stars when it's avrage at best. In a city were there are places that deserve high praise(4-5 stars) this is not one of them. The Mission honestly gets 2.5 to 3 stars for food, 3 for the setting (kinda cool but trying to be too trendy) but lost it when it came to the service, drinks and overall lackluster food, portions/price. I love Matt's other place Zinc Bistro but this just makes me wonder about chefs crossing over to cuisines that they enjoy eating but perhaps don't understand. I might give it another try sometime to see if it improves but I don't think I'll be back... So sad so sad, I guess I'll just have to wait for the next big thing......Mark-~~#~0
This place seems to have a nice selection of linens but somehow they never have IN STOCK what I NEED. I came in here for a Bed-In-a-Bag Set and they had tons of them but none in the size I needed. I asked the employee if they had any other sizes in the back and she said "no" and walked away. She didn't offer to locate a store that had it or anything, lol! On the way out she had the nerve to ask if I found what I needed... "ummmmm No!"~~#~0
Do not go here if you are dark skinned or look in any way, shape or form ethnic. . . The people who work here will be very rude to you and will give you the cold shoulder. That is, unless they walk up to block your pathway with their body and start shouting LOUDLY at you in broken Spanish NO MAS, NO MAS, NO MAS! Because they THINK you are Mexican. (When I answered them politely in fluent English their eyes widened and they glanced at each other awkwardly. . .) Or telling you to put down your things and leave RIGHT NOW because the clock just hit 8:40. I'm actually surprised they didn't take me by the shoulders and push me out the doors and then lock them. :L Especially the guy with the rat's nest growing on his face. They are just no good, no class people who don't understand what good customer service is or means. ***YOU WOULD BE WAY  BETTER OFF TRYING THE GOODWILL RIGHT NEXT DOOR.***~~#~0
Arghh... where do I start? Well, allow me to say that I am not a big fan of Macaroni Grill, but the hubby and the kids seem to like it, so we go there once in a while.Come to think about it, I think we have gotten better service consistently at the Agua Fria and Tatum locations, we also went once in Mesa. However, the few times I have been to the Gold Dust locations... huge disappointments. Once our daughter's wheat pasta was uncooked, and missing the pine nuts (we ordered it because she didn't know what they were). We like the Chianti BBQ Steak, and we have had it at Tatum location, delicious.We went to this place for Christmas Eve, and we were expecting them to be busy. To our surprise, we didn't have to wait that long to be seated. We got a booth (4 of us) and ordered fetuccini and  Penne Rustica for the kids, hubby the Chianti BBQ steak and the Parmesan Veal Chop for me. We ate one piece of bread. We asked for one more. We ate it. Our server apologized for the delay. Long wait. Our server came back and apologized again. Long wait. Our server nowhere to be seen.  Over 50 minutes went by since our order, which I think it is beyond a reasonable delay. We caught the attention of our server and asked for the manager.After a while a manager stopped by and explained they had 2 very big parties (he mention the number 17 each, I think) in a back room. Honestly, in my mind this translated to 'we do have customers more important than you'... we said this was beyond reasonable and were considering leaving, he said being Christmas Eve, everywhere would be busy and we would be better off waiting here, he offered a discount... and left. I tried to get his attention to ask how much longer but he didn't hear me or else... About 8-10 min later he brought our food. As he was leaving I said,  pointing to the Chianti steak: this should have prosciutto and crostini, 'and garlic dip', added my husband. He said, the prosciutto is in there... and left. Well, in my mind I translated that as "I am in a hurry, so I am going to treat you like an idiot'. That is the utmost disrespect, and hence the one star. There is no discount that makes up for that. There was no prosciutto in there. At all. We caught the attention of our server and mentioned the missing ingredients, and he brought a side of prosciutto, some garlic dip, and a piece of bread... nothing like the crostini we have had at the Tatum location. Also, the veal chop is usually huge, and this time it was like half of what I usually get somewhere else. Also, sadly this still may be an improvement, because last time we ordered the Chianti steak here, they didn't even believe us it was supposed to come with garlic dip... honestly... geeezz, can't they read their own menus? oh well, no more Gold Dust in my macaroni... ever.~~#~0
Okay the only reason this hotel has a star is because one is the minimum.  My daughter and I came out to Tempe for orientation at ASU - upon entering the front lobby I realized this was a hold over from 1970 - don't know where they got the pictures online but not at this flea bag. We walked into the room the air - conditioning smelled like it was causing an electrical fire - there was a hole in the wall near the outlet - the place was filthy right to the towels hanging in the bathroom. Do yourself a favor and skip this dump! We didn't stay more than 15 minutes and even at that I was afraid of what else I would see. The front desk thought it was amusing to inform me that the computer and printer in the front lobby are ancient and probably picked up at a second hand auction.~~#~0
When I ate there the service was slow and the food came out just warm. This was after quite a wait. The perogies were very doughy and the filling blah. The sausages had been cooked much earlier and were dry. My group will not be coming back.~~#~0
The place is terrible. I don't understand why it is so crowded. The pancakes tasted like they came out of a box. My son's tatter tots were reheated frozen ones you can buy in a store. The granola tasted and looked like it came from Safeway next door. Save your money. You can make a better breakfast at home.~~#~0
Lord was the service bad. Yes, it was one of those places. It took the waitress over 20 minutes and 4 requests to get us a little balsamic vinaigrette. Seriously, I mean, come on. And you then come and tell me that no one could find it ? Like really? So that was the beginning of the end. When the waitress rolled her eyes in displeasure at us not getting wine the mood was set and there really was no coming back up. The service continued to be appalling.. at best. The food was ok. yea, just ok. Nothing to rave about. Even then it would have got 3-4 stars if the dining experience was pleasant. Avoid if you are going to unwind after a long day.~~#~0
Today was my second time visiting. First time was okay. However, it appears that today the owner/manager was more interested in his bottom line. He missed me ordering their below average breakfast selections and less than okay coffee, so as lunch was nearing he asked that I please move to smaller table (the place was not busy). This would be fine if he had asked everyone in a similar situation, but he did not. Not to worry as I took my business up to Copper Star Coffee.~~#~0
After months of passing this place and wanting to try their food, we finally made it to KKL.  What we weren't expecting from this place was the very pricey menu for fish, shrimp and chips (french fries from a bag, I'm sure)!  The shrimp was different and tastey, I had 4 pieces with chips and also a side of mushrooms.  Chris had clams, chips and a side of cole slaw and of course we ordered the hushpuppies which everyone raves about.  This meal was close to $30 dollars!   Some people may feel that isn't bad for lunch at a seafood place, however for the area the food, which isn't like just from the ocean, it's from a bag - it's way too much money and your gut will feel like a grease pit after eating here!My advice, skip this place if you can!~~#~0
I took my 3 year old here for a haircut and he walked out with the worst one ever.  I understand he is a kid, but he always sits still for his cuts.  The stylist looked as if she was not comfortable cutting his hair and completely rushed through it.  We were out of there in 10 minutes!  To top it all off, she cut his ear with the clippers and didn't even bother to wipe the blood off.  When I made my appointment, I made sure to tell the receptionist that I was bringing in my 3 year old.  Not sure why they gave us someone who clearly isn't good with cutting a child's hair.  We will definitely not be going back.~~#~0
The food was overpriced for something you get so little of and the food tasted like it was frozen not fresh. Service wasn't great but there was only one guy doing everything. Of course everyone has their own opinion. This is mine~~#~0
I really wanted to like this place.  But, I too was grossed out  by the flies crawling on all the pastries.  I have been in there 2 separate times to see if they had done anything about the flies -- nope.  I would love to try one of their award winning cupcakes but not while the flies have first dibs.~~#~0
The food was unimpressive. The hummus wasn't good at all. The fish and chips were ok, but really nothing extraordinary. Plates and silverware were greasy and kind of dirty. I won't be returning. Well, maybe for a drink, but not to dine.~~#~0
Today I notice a Toyota Prius (White) with California License Plates (plate number 6RRM802) illegally parked in the Handicap Parking Space in front of this store -- it was the third time this week that the same car has been parked there.  I went inside to inquire if they knew who owned the vehilce, and a very nice young man responded that it was the "owner" so he really could not say anything about the illegal parking.Then a lady came from the back of the store and asked if I was the guy that was complaining about her parking.  I indicated that I was, and she said she was not really parked there (yet the vehicle was not running, and nobody was in the car -- I guess she has a different definition of parking).  I asked her if she realized that she was in a Handicap Parking Space and she acknowledged that she did know that, and did not really care.  She then asked me if I felt better about myself and I indicated that I was fine, and asked if she felt good about herself parking in a Handicap parking Space -- she said she was fine with.People, we need to collectively do something about this.  The owner of business intentionally parking in a disabled spot, and making no apologies for doing so, and to top it off she owns a business in Arizona and does not have Arizona Plates on her vehicle  ... I say we should all boycott this location of Edible Arrangements ...I am only giving one star, because YELP requires you to give at least one star.~~#~0
The Detour bar and grill is closed, out of business.~~#~0
Just stopped in for lunch and ordered the grilled mahi, but received the fried version. I specifically asked to substitute the brown rice for white rice, which the grilled comes with, but she didn't clarify. At first she was nice, but after their gaffe, her demeanor turned and she didn't even give me utensils or napkins until I asked repeatedly. To make it worse, she went to the kitchen, and the guy ended up giving me the fried fish even though he said it was grilled, which it clearly wasn't. :(~~#~0
My review is basically a repeat of the others. I got a LivingSocial deal as a gift from a friend, and had a bad experience. They cancelled my first appointment at the last minute due to an emergency, which I totally understand. Then the second appointment they were late for, which I also understand, you never know when someone hits traffic or whatever, so that's fine. However, they were supposed to clean for 2 hours and they only cleaned for 1, and they didn't move a single piece of furniture in the house to clean behind it. They rushed out of the house so quickly that the floors were still wet when they peeled out. Very unprofessional, I would not recommend them.~~#~0
If you like your service poor and your food with hair cooked in it, you've found the right place. Nummy!I let the hair thing go ONCE. After all it's not as bad as MY cooking, but the second time it happened I let them know they had permanently lost my business. Their food is below greasy spoon quality as they do things to meat (at least I THINK it's meat) that are unholy. Like cooking their hair in your food and using salt by the pound on any dish. I used to love Kyoto bowl back in the nineties, but  I can see why so many of them are closing now. Bad food, bad service. Steer clear.~~#~0
Our waiter smelled horrible! It wasn't even that busy where I could understand him having B.O. We orded soup and mac and cheese for our dinner. Im not a big fan of the steaks from here. Its hit or miss and id rather not risk a miss and end up with a steak that isnt tender. We could tell right away that our waiter had an attitude after we ordered. We werent very hungry and i was craving the mac and cheese. It is a kids dish but i would order it if they raised the price and made it a dish on the menu. Its so good when they dont make it watery, which they did this time. We had to wait almost 10 minutes after we ordered for our bread and for my drink. After we got our food our waiter never Checked on us. He walked by a dozen times but no refills and no more bread. There was also a small fly buzzing around and a Tiny gnat on our table. When we got our check there was a charge for 2 drinks we did not order! I was furious at that point. When I told the waiter he didn't even seem surprised but rather almost annoyed! I get that our bill was not going to be huge but it doesn't mean our service has to be so bad. Whenever I split a dish or order small items as my entree I always leave a good tip. The bill usually comes out to about $20 like this time and normally I would have tipped $5-6 if the service was good or even decent. I just can't believe he thought he could add onto our bill and get away with it!~~#~0
I ordered the Nachos which is just a huge try of fried wantons with cheese, pepperoni and some type of meat. That tasted interesting but it was a huge tray for $10.00.My friends ordered a Sausage Pizza which had hot dog meat for sausage. The Chicken Alfredo tasted like the hot dogs which some weird cream. For my waffle fries I was given cocktail sauce instead of ketchup... wtf.i'm never going here again.~~#~0
Nice guy behind the counter, but very stingy on the meat. I asked for 2 dishes, both "Large" meaning extra meat but it still was paltry. I asked for a meat/chicken combo w/brown rice and he got it right. I also asked for a large white meat chicken with NO rice, but more veggies. I guess that was too complicated.Both dishes served in a plastic bowl 5/6th full of rice, a thin layer of veggies and a thinner layer of meat.It took exactly 75 seconds for my order to be passed to me. If this was McDonald's , that'd be normal.  For a teriyaki place, that's an obvious indication of 'pre-cookery' so who knows how long ago the meat was made.I just moved here and I really hope this isn't the best Teriyaki this area has to offer.I also got some chicken wrap thing, which was actually pretty good, well 2 of them as that was my own "delivery reward".Paid $19 for the entire order.I won't go back since I'm not into paying all that $$ for a huge bowl of rice and very little meat.This place would not last 1 week in Seattle. (or many other places for that matter)~~#~0
This is the worst Zipps I have ever been to. I have given it more than enough chances to change my mind but the service seems to get slower with every visit. I generally really enjoy Zipps but this location SUCKS!!!~~#~0
We went there last night, had an almond joy milkshake, which tasted terrible, we shared a half size and couldn't even drink it. The burger was ok, in n out makes a better burger for a lot cheaper.~~#~0
Not much I can say, it is a Wal-Mart.  Low, low prices, rude employees.  I guess you get what you pay for.  If Rita the night mgr is working, RUN to Target!!  If Target is closed, find another Wal-mart.If Wal-mart was a Mom&Pop shop, they'd be out of business due to horrible customer service.~~#~0
Quoted to replace parts that were just replaced, plus parts that didnt need to be changed and was told I had a bent torsion bar??? Considering that I am a ASE cert tech and currently working in a dealership, not only was this bad intel but flat out lies. I told a family member to take it there for a quick alignment, this is what I got. This shop I would not let work on my kids bike. Shade tree techs at this shop~~#~0
The worse. He clipped half my dog. I had to tell him he forgot the other half. When people saw my dog they started to laugh the job was so bad.~~#~0
Sorry folks, but this place is terrible.  I had heard my friends raving about it for awhile, but finally had the, uh, "opportunity" to try it out myself.When I first walked in, I noticed it was just $9 for a big bowl, far cheaper than what I'm used to paying at Genghis Grill.  Sounds good, right?Well, when I got to the food selections, I noticed a few things.  First, the meat was frozen. Second, there are only four meat options (frozen chicken, frozen beef, frozen turkey, and frozen pork).  Third, the vegetable selection is limited.  You'll have your lettuce, carrots, cabbage, tomatoes, onions, mushrooms, noodles, tofu, and bean sprouts, but there's not much more.  No eggs, baby corn, or anything else that might be interesting.  Oh, and no dry seasonings.The sauces were encouraging.  I liked the idea of mixing and matching the different components.  After I tasted my food, however, backtracked on the sauce.  My bowl was quite soupy, but very bland.  The sauces have almost no flavor whatsoever.  Now I know why they provide that hot mustard... You need it if you want to actually taste something.The portions were great, but I didn't even finish mine because it was just a bland, soupy mess of frozen garbage.  I think I'll spend the few extra bucks on Genghis.~~#~0
fatty meat low quality with inflated prices. this place has went down substantially~~#~0
POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE:I have been a long term customer --- Always a cheese or sausage and two pieces of  cheese cake and chicken wings. Last night my wife wanted KFC - so I went there and got her meal - I called Mamma Mia from KFC and said I would like two slices and a cheese cake ---- the girl said we don't take orders for slices over the phone. Are you kidding? She said it was a rule and it had something to do with being ready for walk in customers. I said I am a customer. I explained that I had my wife's food with me and I did not want to wait for the slices as sometimes it is not that quick and I didn't want her food to get cold. She then gave me another girl - who said the same thing - the manager Chris was out. I asked her to have him call me. No call back - and I called back twice for him and he was always out. I cannot believe that they would be so customer unfriendly and cannot believe they have some silly rule about not being able to order slices over the phone - I guess that includes cheese cake. That is ok ---- I went to Spinatos which is much better. Mama Mia has lost my business of the last ten years ------ I am out of there.CHRIS MAYBE YOU SHOULD RETURN A CUSTOMERS CALL - THE OWNER SHOULD FIRE YOU. MAYBE YOU DONT KNOW WHO I AM. I AM THE CUSTOMER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!~~#~0
ahhh back in the day!!! when it was fresh and good, then fucking Fresh an Easy came along{ yes i do love me some f@E but damn}and they ruined it for all of us... Now it is like going back to an old boyfriend that you pretended was not that bad, righhhht... They tried, really they did but it is just a shell, the magic is gone.. I've always been in love with you, i guess you know it's true, you took my love for granted.... why? the show is over say goodbye....SAY gooodbye....you broke my heart...~~#~0
Worst of airport food.  Since the owning company is in Arizona, they obviously need to come out unannounced and do a quality check.  The meat was very gristle ridden and almost flavorless. Salt and pepper are desperately needed.  The onions were totally under done and the meat seemed precooked so it was overcooked when served.  The fries were not completely cooked.  They should strive to be like Charlies in the Atlanta airport and less like an greedy food vendor who doesn't care about quality.~~#~0
This location have ruined multiple pieces of clothing.  For some reason I kept going back thinking it wouldn't happen again but invariably it did.     If you want your shirts beaten up and destroyed, shiny shimmery slacks, broken buttons, destroyed ties then by all means go to Prestige cleaners.  If you want your clothes properly taken care of go to Raves Cleaners.~~#~0
I am glad to see that some of the reviews on here also show that this place has poor ownership and management because this is exactly what I experienced.  We went by this place for a boxing match one night, and our service was absolutely awful all night in every manner and degree possible.  It's not the first time that we have had bad service and most of us have worked in the industry so we sort of just let it be and watch our fight, as really, were adults and complaining won't get us anywhere anyway.  We realize that bad service happens, and sometimes it's not even the server's fault.  However, after the fight we had been waiting on our bill for about 10 minutes, and the room we were in was then being used for a party, so they were clearing it out.  They forced us out of our table and then the owner approached us to unruly command us to leave the room, at which juncture I tried to explain to him we were just trying to get our bill and wanted to stay in the room so that our waitress could find us.  This old man continued to be unruly at which point I then brought to his attention that not only was he being out of line but that the service had been awful all night.  He then started yelling at me about why we did not say anything earlier and basically insinuated that I was lying about bad service.  To top it off, he was so upset that he then started chest bumping me and picking a fight with me.  This resulted in the bouncer using physical force to remove me from the room, while yelling at me to respect the owner.  Frankly, I should have called the police. Then, I had to wait OUTSIDE of the bar for my bill  for another 30 minutes!  This place is awful and I wouldn't even wish upon my enemies to have to go here.~~#~0
The food was not very good. My pasta sauce tasted like it was from a can and the salmon was fishy tasting.  I only ate a very small amount.  My husbands dish of stuffed pork also was nothing to write home about. The salad and app and good--but that was it.  Also the band plays in the bar where we ate and the sound system is terrible.  You can't hear the music very good and certainly can't understand a word they say.  Overall this place wasn't very good and I would not waste my money to go back.~~#~0
I wish I could give zero stars. I live nearby so I was hoping I could use this dry cleaner. I went in yesterday with a few clothing items. Problems: 1) They didn't have their prices listed anywhere in the store 2) The woman behind the counter was rude when I asked her how much it would be to dry clean my clothing items. I found it strange that when I asked her the price to dry clean she didn't know and had to punch a bunch of numbers on a calculator to finally tell me that my suit pants would cost $6+, the skirt would be $6+ and the jacket would be $7+. I couldn't believe it. No thanks. I will be driving two miles out of my way to go to the cleaners futher north on 7th Ave that charge less than $2 per item.I can't believe people patronize this business. Anyone who pays $7+ to get a suit jacket dry-cleaned must be a millionaire with money to burn or a moron. Don't be a moron.~~#~0
Totally agree with the other reviewers about Einstein's being overpriced. A small coffee alone costs $1.91 after tax and adding cream cheese to a bagel costs more than the bagel itself. Sure, the bagels are pretty good, but this is Mesa, not New York City.My real beef with this place, though, is the customer service. Although there are always plenty of people behind the counter, I have waited numerous times in a line that reaches the door. On my visit this morning, I saw a customer walk in, see the line, and turn right back around. Also on my visit today, I tried using a coupon for a "free bagel thin with light shmear." The picture in-store advertised the bagel thin with pink cream cheese and my kids were excited to get their bagel with strawberry cream cheese (which is also listed as one of their reduced-fat options, which means "light," right?) When I ordered this, however, I was told that this was not possible because corporate is only allowing them to use ONE kind of light shmear for this promotion. Even the general manager refused to make a substitution, while watching my 3-year-old cry with disappointment (I know, it's a little thing, but come on, he's 3.) So congratulations, Einstein's at Gilbert & Baseline. You've just made a customer never want to return over your refusal to substitute 2 tablespoons of cream cheese. Do you think that's what corporate had in mind?~~#~0
Eek!  Me thinks not is the truth!  HORRIBLE with a CAPITAL HORRIBLE!  About 3-4 weeks ago I took in a 20x20 poster to be framed.  The guy told me it would be ready 9/19.  Notice that It's 3 days later than 9/19 and I have not yet received a call from them telling me my frame STILL isn't ready, but I have also called multiple times since Monday and I sit on hold for 10-20 minutes only to find out they still haven't done my frame.  If you quote a date, it needs to be available to be picked up that day or before in my opinion.  After speaking to the manager just now, he says they have "125 customers that they deal with weekly in the framing dept."  uh-huh.  That's NOT that many customers for a big name store and if they can't get their s*** together by the day they say they will, then they better back it up with a phone call or in the future recommend a later day that the item should be finished and ready for pickup.  Total crap. Two thumbs DOWN, wayyyy DOWN.~~#~0
I came here with a big group and was excited to have a good dinner, however that did not happen. First, half of our party was going to be late so we decided to put in an order of appetizers and order two bottles of wine for the table. Ten minutes later the rest of our party showed up.. Another five minutes our caprese appetizer came, then the wine a couple minutes after that. Finally after 10 more minutes we reminded our waitress about the garlic bread we ordered and only then did it come to the table. Then as the rest of the party was getting their drinks the waitress spilled a tray of three ice teas all over one of the women in my group and her purse. Since we were a big party and the waitress obviously messed up I thought it would be appropriate for her to offer to comp some of our drinks, this did not happen. Later, we were ordering all of our food and we decided to just split all of the entrees. Since I'm a vegetarian I decided I was going to order the gnocchi to be sure there was a dish I could eat, however our waitress informed me they were all out of the gnocchi that night. So not wanting to make a big deal about it I informed her I was vegetarian and since one of the dishes my party had already ordered was the Quattro al Forno (which included the Cheese Manicotti, Chicken Cannelloni, Baked Ravioli and Stuffed Shells), she explained that all were vegetarian except the chicken cannelloni. I hadn't really studied the menu so I trusted what she said and told her that i could get by on eating off of those plates. Fast forward to when we finally get our dinner, someone in my party advocated for me to get first pick at the plates "without meat" so I got a stuffed shell and some of the baked ravioli. After eating the baked ravioli i started chewing some of the stuffed shell and realized there was indeed meat in it. I quickly spit it out but couldn't believe there would be meat in the dish. When the waitress came back a member of my party asked the waitress again if there was meat in the stuffed shells and she said no. Then I spoke up and said there was and that I had tasted it. She responded that she would go check on that. She came back a few minutes later and told me what I already knew, that there was meat in the shells. She offered no real apology to me, did not offer to bring me out another dish or comp anything. I was so upset and felt so sick after that it really ruined the rest of my dinner and night, not to mention I have been vegetarian for six years and this waitress couldn't even offer me an apology for something that was clearly her mess up.~~#~0
If I could give it negative stars, I would. The only good thing about them is their price. They are also a pretty good size, but everything is cheap, broken, and poorly made. I guess if it's all you can afford and you don't mind sharing your home with hundreds (probably thousands) of roaches, then they aren't bad. We moved in almost a month ago, and have been begging management to do something about the roaches but all they do is spray on Wednesdays and that does nothing. We have sprayed and fogged and baited and nothing works. We kill between 30 and 50 a day/night. It's horrible! We even have bites from those nasty things..seriously, google it. I'm not walking back in that place besides to get my (probably roach infested) stuff out. Besides the roaches, their playground and gym and everything else is always closed. The pool is so chlorinated it burns your skin for days. And it's not the safest place to walk around at night. I would rather be poor in a decent place than try to save money at that hellhole. I could go on for days, but just ask yourself, do you really want to live in a place that doesn't care that they are completely infested with roaches. All the residents I talked to said their place was just as bad..am I the only one who can't live like that?!~~#~0
Needing a quick bite to eat, I thought I would try a new place in my very own neighborhood...big mistake!I ordered the chimichanga plate and the beef burrito plate... the rice and beans were good, and they were generous with the guacamole (only plus), but it is what was inside that disturbed me... shredded beef, stringy onions, and canned tomatoes cooking on a stove in a pot for an entire day (maybe longer)... then shove that into both the beef burrito and the chimichanga... I don't think so!Reasonable prices, friendly staff, and great beans.. but I can get that at home from a can. Pass on this one, trust me. sigh...~~#~0
Sad excuse for a dog park. I was so disappointed, especially because the regular park itself is gorgeous! No trees, grass, or benches, and no where for your dog to get water. The place was filthy and tiny, I could barely throw a tennis ball!~~#~0
I just don't get it? I eat at 4* steakhouses all the time and this one missed every where. The ingredients were good but not cooked properly. Not even close. How do you deliver a 4 oz Filet raw? It would be over cooked on my grill in 8 minutes! I pointed out the problems immediately but they just didn't listen. The manager stopped by and I indicated it was a C- at best halfway through the meal. She didn't seem to care and vanished for about 30 minutes. When she came back Everything she said made my son celebrating his birthday and I feel worse. I have never run into such abrasive management. I understand things go wrong and that's OK. Step up, show you care and make it better. At least try?When the manager returned she saw we had eaten less than half the meal and passed on desert.??? We were celebrating a birthday? Who doesn't have desert? Then she asked how things were and I said not good. That we came expecting a great meal and it wasn't right. She asked why I didn't say something sooner? I was floored! When someone says you are delivering C- quality to your face early into the meal how could she be so attentive after that or be surprised by our disappointment? Then the check arrived and it was clear she could care less. We were just a couple of out of town diners she couldn't wait to get rid of.  I let her know in no uncertain times that Capital Grille is supposed to be all about The Experience. that by their own claims they desire "that everything, and we mean everything, that arrives at your table at The Capital Grille delights you." As much as the food was average at best the least delightful thing that arrived at my table was the manager. Everything she said made it worse and I don't know how she ended up in that job? She ended up comping the meal and I still felt like I overpaid. I would have happily paid $200 for the food cooked properly and the level of service I routinely experience at Ruth Chris, Donovan's, LG's, Fleming's, The Palm etc.Earlier in the day I spent over $500 for a 2 hour desert ATV tour with my son. It felt like a bargain in comparison. We left after dinner feeling lousy and i didnt want my son ending his night that way. We went to a Coldstone across the street. My son asked why I was taking him there as he didn't want ice creme. I said that I wanted him to see someone deliver a quality product with cheerful service. We each had a spoonful and threw out the rest. I left a $20 tip for ice creme we didn't even want or eat. But on the way home he understood the difference.~~#~0
IF you want a waitress that puts you down for complaining that the mac and cheese is cold EAT HERE!  "Personally I would't eat it, it's too hot for my taste." As she sets it down after they re heated the mac.  UMMM....Yeah I LOVE eating cold mac and cheese. ( THE NEXT DAY! as left overs!)My husband ordered the steak salad and  he asked for it to be cooked medium, but it came out raw.  My flat bread was burnt almost black, and crispy, not the way I would or anyone with food sense would eat it.The only thing good about this is place that the one star gets is the lemonade mango juice.~~#~0
My dog has fine hair that naturally tangles and, despite the daily brush, gets slightly matted at times in a couple of spots; when I say slightly, I mean it: I can fix it with a comb in just a few minutes. It used to be no problem when we lived in another state, where I would take her to a Petsmart salon and she would come out with a nice cut. Here, at this location, they don't bother brushing her and insist on shaving her every single time, plus they charge extra for having to deal with matted hair. It feels as if they look for the easiest way to deal with her rather than give full attention. Must off to find a more dedicated groomer.~~#~0
The last time we dined at Beckett's was about a month ago, and the last. We have been big fans of the place since it opened, and have been there several times. The food is always good, and we found one server we liked a lot (sorry but her name escapes me) but the last time we were there, our server lied to us to cover up for the huge ego in the kitchen that would not accomodate a special request my husband had for his dessert - which was to add another scoop of ice cream to it. That's it. Game over.~~#~0
I'm from the east coast, and recently moved to the area.  So I bought into all the hype and the good ratings on Yelp and tried In And Out.  Boy, was I thoroughly disappointed.  I checked out their website before I went and knew what was on their regular menu and their "not so secret" menu.   I was ready to order as we pulled up during the dinner hour to a very full drive thru.  It took 10 mins from the time we ordered to the time we got our food.  I was prepared for this and wasn't really an issue for me.  So I get home and unpack my food and get ready to eat.  The fries are very cold, bland and had a lot of burnt fries in the mix.  I just smothered them in ketchup and had them anyway.  Nothing special there.Now for the burger.  I have never in my life eaten a burger with more than one patty (except for a Big Mac) just because I never need/want that much ground beef on my sandwich.  Well I could have gone 4x4 on this one because these beef patties were the thinnest I have EVER seen from a fast food joint.  They were black, charred, and leather looking on the outside, yet somehow despite the microscopic thinness of the patty were still pink on the inside.  Yuck.Overall this meal was pretty disgusting and certainly did not live up to its reputation.  I seriously doubt I will ever visit an In and Out chain again.~~#~0
The dancers are awesome, the food is horrible. My friend had a living social/groupon type thingy for this place....what a scam. They make you order entrees instead of tapas. There was no fine print about minimum entree orders. It was a nightmare. Honestly I thought the food was gross & just plain blah. I can usually find something nice to say about a place...in this case its only that the dancer was great.~~#~0
Terrible.  I was craving French food so my boyfriend and I tried it out. It looked nice enough at first, and the pastries/desserts looked good. I ordered the croquette misseur (sandwich). He got a creamed asparagus soup with coconut somethin in it. My sandwich was not French at all. The bread was thick and not a baguette, the cheese was cheddar, and the ham was thick cut, super salty deli meat. No bechamel sauce as I know it came on the sandwich. It came with an American style side salad. The soup was stringy! I was expecting satiny goodness with a refined, slight coconut taste. No way. They covered the soup with spices that didn't compliment the taste. After our server brought out food, she never returned to our table! We had both put our napkins in our plates and sat there quietly (there was hardly anyone else left in the restaurant). She continued to chat with another employee behind the counter that was 3 feet away from us. I was going to order some crepes to try, but got too frustrated. Finally, we spoke up for our check and left. I will not go back here.~~#~0
Sorry folks, Chuy's is no longer open at this location. It is now a restaurant called "Bisquits"' serving breakfast and lunch.~~#~0
The hostesses didn't say a word to me until I had been staring at them and tapping my foot for seven minutes while they talked with each other. Later on getting the check and then processing it each took ages. It wasn't even a full section. The food was okay...~~#~0
This event was miserable.  I was really jazzed all week to try some cool food trucks and I ended up leaving having had waited 30 minutes for half a hot dog that my boyfriend and I shared. We never did get a beer. A couple of ideas for next time, that is if anyone would show up again...1. A REAL VIP tent... I would far prefer to drop a bit of coin to have tables, chairs, an open bar and food samples brought from across the event. Call me lazy, but id rather spend between $75-100 for a great experiance than $38 for a horrible and frustrating. 45 minutes plus walking to park.2. 86 the kiddies stuff... Add more food trucks, or better yet, more places to get beer and soda. 3. Local,draft,craft beer... 4. Groupon, really? Did you think you needed this? Who was going to pass up a $5 per person event. Aside from being completely over crowded, the event was bait and switch as far as cost (food tickets for $2 were nowhere to be seen). Glad it brought us to that side of town to go to another of our favorite restaurants to ACTUALLY eat.~~#~0
Went in on a Saturday late afternoon, not sure if they were made the day prior but the 3 cupcakes my daughter and I got were all dry and even HARD on the edges. obviously stale. what a waste to pay $3 a cupcake for stale, DRY cupcakes.  so disappointed!.~~#~0
Hey, we know what we're getting with Filiberto's... cheap Mexican grub in large quantities! Some Filiberto's are clean and somewhat nice, this location definitely isn't one of them.  The dining room was dark, grimey and dingy, the tables are too high for the bench seats, and whats with only turning on a single light in the entire space???  The restaurant had a weird odor ( I probably don't want to know what it was) and our food was all extremely over cooked, probanly spending an entire day under the warming lights because most people have abandoned this location.  Every single thing in the restaurant was worn out and dirty. Time to spend a few bucks on a rehab or close this dump down. What a waste of a meal!~~#~0
The service at this place is horrible. I hadthreepeople walk past me while i waited at the counter. Had no idea if i was suppose to sit down or order at the counter to eat in. Nobody asked me. When i told them i had never eaten here before, the gal was NO HELP. I clearly stated that i did not want some thing on my sandwich and it came with it anyway. I also got my sandwich served in a bag at the table, i guess that answered my question about where i was suppose to order. If this place plans to stay open in Scottsdale, they better get some better service going. Now i know why places with good food don't survive!~~#~0
If I could give them less stars, I would.  We arrived to the festival at about 5:00pm with tickets to the tequila tent.  The tent was shut down, most of the booths were sold out of tacos and we basically left after about thirty minutes.I have contacted this company three times to get a refund because I didn't get to use my tequila passes and I don't think it is right that I paid entrance for an event that was practically sold out (Hello, stop letting people in if you know that there is no food left.)  I have yet to get a response, so I am hoping this will garner some sort of reply to my request.  The level of customer service exhibited by the people that put this on is AWFUL. If this issue is not resolved, I, and my group of friends, will not be returning in the future.~~#~0
So Fox Sports Grill has become The Canyon Grill....new concept with live music venue, same very very disappointing food. An upscale looking place in an upscale location should serve at least half way upscale food.....I would rather eat at Chili's . It is too bad because the ambiance and viewing options are great. PLEASE change the menu, change the food quality, change the chef.~~#~0
Well folks...it is a sad, sad day up in North Scottsdale.Blue Wasabi in DC Ranch has served its last piece of sushi.  They were closed as of Saturday.  FYI: it is rumored that Kevin, the owner, did not want to renew his lease.  Also closing will be San Felipe across the street.~~#~0
Paul's personnel were courteous, prompt, and professional - but even after 6 or 7 visits, were utterly unable to eliminate  - or apparently even slow down the termite infestation.   Inexpensive termite control contract came with house purchase- only $99 per year.  No problem for couple of years but then the beasts arrived. IDespite 6 or 7 treatments there was no apparent effect on the termite invasion.  They did not appear deterred in the heavily treated areas - and were spreading even after repeated visits. They were not only apparently not deterred, they didn't even appear mildly discouraged. Gave up after last treatment by Paul's in 10/08. Paid a comparative FORTUNE for treatment by Truly Nolan - but they stopped the invasion.~~#~0
Second time here. Very disappointed. It's one thing to own a land rover and frequent the service department regularly, but when the service manager is unhelpful and totally vacant you really question your choice in service centers. This will be my 3rd time here and they still can't find me in their system. Oh wait $5,000 in service needed. I'm in their system now.~~#~0
Amazingly disgusting yet mildly charming. Odors of all sorts, dirt & filth plus sweet sound of pigeons outside my window. Spotted: two coke cans circa 1990s in the gutters. A gem of a place :)~~#~0
Yesterday was my second time at Primp and Blow. The first time was pretty good, and I needed to have my hair done for date night so I thought I would give it a second try. It's only $35 right? Wrong. My advice is to save your $$. First of all, the ladies up front were completely rude. I showed up early for my appt. (WHAT A CRIME) and was basically treated like dirt. They told me to come back because nothing was available until my appt. time. OK, That was all good until the owner walked up and told the girl helping me at the front desk that she had to do my hair. Turns out they are both stylists (not receptionists) and just didn't want to take a walk-in appt. AWKWARD!!!!Not only that, but my hair was already shampooed, I had just come from home. Talk about the easiest client ever! She was so obviously upset about having to do my hair that I almost walked out... Not at all welcoming.Service was poor from the beginning to the end. She spent about 20 minutes on my hair (While the girl next to me was given much more time and attention by her stylist)... and the blowout was terrible. Not good. In fact, parts of my hair were still wet when I left. HUH???? That is your only task... to dry hair. I paid my $35. Didn't tip, and won't ever be back. In fact, I think i'll check out their competitors.~~#~0
My wife and I have been looking at this place for a long time and finally decided to give it a try tonight.  She ordered the fillet w lobster tail, garlic mashed potatoes and green beans.  I choose the 16oz porter house with baked potato and dinner salad.  Both steaks were very tough.  For the "prime" cuts of beef that they were said to be, these didn't come close to what you'd expect for a top quality steak house.  The dinner salad was close to frozen, the bread was very dry, the lobster tail was good, but nothing special.  The service was average.  All in all, we were sorely disappointed and I'm sure we won't return.~~#~0
Went there tonight just to find that they're closed. :(~~#~0
A nice gym, but they make canceling the membership very difficult.  They require 30 days notice, in writing or in-person. they will not accept over the phone or electronic cancellation.~~#~0
One its a McDonalds and two  its a McDonalds.  There is two places to order in the drive thru but for some reason the drive through allays has a huge wait.~~#~0
The guys working here seemed very bothered I wanted to purchase a smoothie.  Very unfriendly!!~~#~0
Called us on Father's Day, an hour before our reservation, to tell us they were going out of business!  Horrible!~~#~0
If Kurt Cobain had been here in the summer time, he would have sang "Smells Like Athlete's Foot." Thank goodness, he lived in the Northwest.This 24-Hour Fitness, especially the men's locker room, is disgusting. I took a shower once after a good workout and I had to count the years from my last tetanus shot. Filthy, shaky, rusty partitions in the shower. The rest of the gym has an "I love the 80's" vibe. It's one pastel short of a Richard Simmons' color scheme. There were gym rats who perspire so much at stationary bikes that sweat drips from the machine and forms a pool on the floor. If you have an over-active sweat glands, please have the courtesy to wipe. Worst of all, on my fourth (and last) visit, a petty thief broke my locker and stole all my cash. I reported the incident, filled up a form, and got valuable advice: "Don't use combination lock, it's easy to break." Ummm...really? When some gym members have bolt cutters instead of fitness gloves, it's time to move on to a different gym.~~#~0
There are too many ice crystals in Mojo Yogurt.  I threw half of mine away.  I prefer creamier fro yo.~~#~0
My husband and I decided to check out the Chymist for lunch today.  Parking lot busy - The Chymist empty..... We  seated ourselves as instructed and waited to be noticed.  The bartender/waitress finally came over and had such a bad attitude!  She was very short and snippy with her answers and not very interested in us.  My husband put down his menu and without hesitation said "let's leave"     We walked over to Wildflower Bread Company where we were greeted with smiles and wonderful food:).  Stick to the Chymist for happpy hour - where you will get half price apps and a drink for the attitude.~~#~0
This place sucks...it could be a nice laundromat as laundromats go but unfortunately, they let 20 little kids run through the store pouring cherry flavored sugar straws in with your laundry, and not cleaning up the place..there is always one Mexican lady there who never speaks...I don't think she speaks English, but is never very helpful. I hate this laundromat with a passion they need to get some better help in here and have more control over the people that wash here. Plus that it is virtually in possible to get a hold of any one if you want to complain and no one has ever answered one of the comment cards I have left, most of  the time they do not have them, I have been ripped off here had laundry ruined.Not worth it to go here.~~#~0
WORST AIRLINE SERVICE EVVVVVER!!!!!!!! I arrived at the airport only to realize that our check in bags weren't coming out of the carousel. WTF??? So everyone from our flight went to US Airways bag claim/ customer service and find out OUR BAGS ARE LOST!!! Numerous customers in line who have flown with US Airways before said this always happens when you fly US Airways. So I decided to wait patiently in line like the rest to give my 2 cents when randomly boxes and bags began to trickle in and "they claim they don't know how they got there or where they came from" So how did some of the passengers get portions of their belongings????  Oh and the employees with company apparently know how to talk back at frustrated, angry customers. Well then....~~#~0
We were also one of the customers who used the restaurant.com coupon. I had been to this place once before and thought it ok enough to return. Both myself and my daughter love salmon sashimi so we ordered it as usual. What they placed on our table was NOT salmon sashimi. It had the look and texture of smoked salmon. We brought it to the attention of the staff. Unbelieveable that they truly believed it was how it was supposed to look. I've had more than my fair share over the years and have never come across such stupidity. How can you serve sashimi to people that has been cooked and is obviously not RAW? So the guy took it back and brought out another serving of the same exact thing. Same conversation again. I finally had him take it back and got the tuna instead which I didn't want but was ok. I can't walk into the place again knowing that their sushi chef can't tell the difference... it's embarrassing for them. Even before the food was served my three year old knocked over a small cup of water. Not one single person on the staff... who by the way weren't doing anything but talking behind the counter, made an attempt to offer us a towel to wipe it from the table or the floor. We tried to get their attention but they ignored us. We finally got up and grabbed towels to clean it up... only when we did this did they take notice. I will never go back to this place.~~#~0
Sunday was the 3rd chance I've given this place, becasue I like the decor and the music.  But the fact is, the food is bland, over-priced and the service is bad.  This last visit, the waiter only showed up to take our order, and pick up the check.  The food was delivered by others.  I watched the waiter walk around aimlessly like he had nothing to do, and was even standing on the main floor watching TV a great deal of the time.I had a house margarita, which I know is not supposed to be quality, but I have a low resistance to alcohol.  It tasted like lime-flavored water and no alcohol at all could be detected.I'm done!  Sorry Jimmy!  Better call "Bar Rescue" !~~#~0
Terrible....TERRIBLE!  Zero customer service.  "Dan" (manager?  service manager?) was particularly unhelpful.  If they don't want to provide customer service they should stay in the mail order business.  Try Landis, Slippery Pig or Focus for service.  Buy parts at Beyond Bikes, Jensen or Chain Love, forget these bozos......~~#~0
The WORST experience I have had in a store.  Recently went to the store to pick up a few items.  There were 2 prices for one item.  When, I got to the cashier, she huffed and threw things around.  Called customer service and they gave a lame apology.  I will never go back!~~#~0
Although there wasn't much customers in the restaurant, the waiter took a while to come to our table until my wave my hand for their attention.I ordered Nem Nuong roll and Bun Rieu (which is noodle shrimp in a crab soup base). The Nem Nuong roll is horrible, the noodle was cold when I took a bite. Usually the roll should  be somewhate warm and the rice wrapping is soft. But in this case, it was cold. When the Bun Rieu bowl came out, I was surprise at their portion. It is way too small for a price of $6.95. They should just consider that size for a lunch menu for $4.95. I was not impressed with the taste either. I think I only ate 20% of the bowl, and I feel bad for wasting it. The broth has no taste, I had to add some fish sauce to make it saltier, which is not something you add to a bowl of Bun Rieu. The blood pudding was hard and not soft. And the cook are going cheap with the ingredients, I did not taste any crab or shrimp. Most place would mix some eggs and crab paste which is soft when you take a bit of it, but instead I got some shredded pork maybe mixed with 1% crab paste roll in a ball and just drop into the soup and hard when you bit into it.  It was horrible.I would not return here.~~#~0
Got take out tonight. Wow this place is the worst Chinese food I have ever had! Ordered Vegetable Crispy Chow Mien which turned out to be a box of spouts and celery with a handful of Crispy Noodles from a can. Also asked for extra spicy Orange Chicken which was very runny and all breading. I think the only thing that was edible was the steamed rice and stale fortune cookie. I don't recommend this place to anyone. (I don't like Panda Express either, so don't think I am that type of food person.)BTW... My fortune cookie taught me "ce sou" which is Chinese for RESTROOM and is where I will be after trying this place.~~#~0
This place evidently has been closed since the 17th of November for good.Would have been nice if they had updated their website. We went last night, and the windows are papered over and there's a note in the menu window telling you they are done for good.Weak sauce!~~#~0
See more reviews at city search. In short, this is a horrific company that is not honest, unresponsive and hell bent on misrepresentation. Hire a company that owns it's buses. This company has nothing but an ego and a desire to take your money. You will be disappointed with this company and all of their lousy employees.~~#~0
As I already stated the item was broken.  It was a key chain.  The internal spring was broken and is not going to show up in a photo.  Amazingly when I told Amazon.com about this they refunded my money no questions asked.  They didn't even ask for the item to be returned.  NOW that is customer service.  Something that this company knows nothing about.  DO NOT BUY FROM this company.~~#~0
Vegetarians can usually get a good meal at Middle Eastern restaruants.  Not at ZKB.  The hummus and falafel were just awful.~~#~0
Oh, Filibertos... how we Arizonans hate to love you.Anyone who's lived in the Valley long enough knows someone who has eaten tainted Filibertos and spent a sleepless day/night on the floor of their bathroom curled up in a ball with paralyzing stomach cramps and severe dehydration from vomiting and/or diarrhea. But until it actually happens to you, the warnings usually go unheeded. My food poisoning came from the Apache Junction restaurant, but the widespread stories are all the same (give Yelp a search).Much like nicotine or alcohol, something about the food is addicting. It's definitely not the quality of ingredients or the bland flavor (more red and green sauce, please). Maybe it's the portion size? Maybe it's the price? Or maybe it's because it's one of the only places open at 2:00am when you're coming home after a night of tempting every other vice in the book and you figure you'll roll the dice one more time... Good luck!~~#~0
Ganem came recommended by a friend.  I took my Breitling watch to them a little under 2 years ago.   They recommended sending it into Breitling to have a full service overhaul at the Breitling factory.   I got it back, the watch worked great and I paid $600.The problem is Ganem never sent it back to Breitling.  They DID have someone work on it, however, when I had another issue with it this year and did send it to Breitling, I uncovered the fact they Ganem lied aobut having sent it in.  Breitling had no record of ever having serviced my watch.That to me is really shady.~~#~0
"Maybe next time".  Brak must be prophetic.  On our next visit, we got to experience the famous "warmth" that Grandma is known for.  Let's put it this way - this joint can be about as warm as Hitler's bunker during a power failure in January.  There are too many excellent breakfast options in the area that deserve our business to have to put up with such foolishness.  Sayonara, Grandma.~~#~0
I had a horrible experience with this place so I may be biased. I went in the middle of the summer to reserve a spot for coworkers. I was sweating, overheating, hungry and miserable. I went next door to get a snack, the bartender completely ignored me for 10 minutes. When he did come over he was snooty and a real bastard. I ordered olives to keep myself from passing out, that took another 15 minutes. He brought it, I gave him a 5 and he never returned with my change! He didn't deserve my money!!But once we finally entered the pizzeria it was boring and overhyped. The wait staff was just as uninterested as the bartender and never brought refills or a glass of water!!Seriously, eff this place~~#~0
My husband and I were very disappointed after our most recent trip to this location. My husband received a coupon via email for $14 off an oil change. He called yesterday and asked if he had to print it out or of he could just bring in his phone. They told him he could show it on his phone, and then my husband informed them he'd be in the next day to redeem it. They said okay. So fast forward to today (1/24). My husband shows the guy the coupon when he went to pay, and the guy said he wouldn't accept it because they were already running a $10 off deal. Obviously we knew we weren't going to get $14 off the already discounted price, so we just asked him to price it at regular price then give us the $14 off since our coupon was worth more. He didn't budge. We had another coupon for 15% of the other services they did but they still wouldn't take it. So I'm angry for two reasons: 1) our coupons were completely invalid when they shouldn't have been and 2) nobody told my husband that he couldn't use it when he called about it yesterday. Although it was only 4 dollars, it's really the principle. We didn't even get an apology for this inconvenience. Pretty poor customer service on their behalf. These guys have officially lost two regular customers over this. I hope the 4 bucks was worth it, Jiffy Lube!~~#~0
Based on my recent experience: Warning..... Do not do not do kitchen granite counter tops through Home Depot. They did incorrect measurements, wrong cuts, & installed defective cracked granite. They do not stand behind their product or installations as they claim. They were unethical & deceptive to me. I am in shock over the poor customer service levels. I will never do business with them on any level ever again.  Very disappointed as one would think Home Depot would be a go to place.~~#~0
For the past year and a half, it seems like every article, TV program, and person I know who raves about pizza in Downtown Phoenix that isn't at Bianco has been telling me that I must try Cibo.  "It's amazing! The food is fantastic! The service is wonderful! They're so friendly there!" they all cry with passion.After my experience tonight, the only things I can think of are either (1) I somehow entered a parallel universe around that block and entered a different Cibo, kind of like that episode of "Star Trek," or (2) every one of those sources from my first paragraph is full of beans.  Given that no one working in the restaurant had the necessary Evil Spock-esque goatee, I'm going to assume the latter.  Lest you think I'm being too negative about this place, let me say this: Cibo is definitely a place that serves food.We (there were three of us) came in at 6:45 on a Friday and were able to get a seat within 5 minutes, even though the patio and inside were both packed - score!  It was a table tucked away in a corner, which we felt would be good for keeping ambient noise to a minimum,After scoping out some of the food at the other tables, it was determined that a shared appetizer and two pizzas should have been enough for the three of us.  We chose the Schiacciata Maremma, which, besides being impossible for me to pronounce, was described as a roasted vegetable on focaccia-type sandwich, and the margherita (traditional) and funghi (mushroom) pizzas.The sandwich came first, and we thought that the order may have been put in wrong.  While it was definitely two pieces of bread (that looked and tasted nothing like any focaccia that I've ever had, and not in the good way) with stuff in the middle, it seemed to be missing half of the ingredients.  Billed as being filled with "mozzarella, roasted bell peppers, eggplant and zucchini," we discovered that there was neither eggplant or zucchini anywhere to be found.  Additionally, the whole sandwich was cold, depriving us of gooey, melted mozzarella-y goodness.  We would have complained to our waitress, but she had disappeared, deciding early on to abandon our table after taking our order, serving every other table in the section except for ours.When the pizzas came (brought by a different waitress), things looked up.  THIS is what Cibo is known for, right?  Quality pizza with fresh ingredients!  Tasty, simple pizza.  Maybe it was a bit TOO simple.The margherita pizza was a disaster.  The sauce was thin and runny, tasting like the tomato water left over from the can after the tomatoes were used to make the actual pizza sauce, with a lot of salt added in to attempt to cover for the lack of actual spices and seasoning.  The basil was haphazardly thrown on top, most of it still attached to one sprig.  I suppose that if Cibo was billed as an interactive cooking and eating experience, I might have appreciated that a bit more.  After the first slice was eaten, I figured that maybe I had grabbed a bad one (which can happen sometimes with pizzas), so I tried a different slice from the other side of the pie.  It was cold already, and quite soggy.  Since Cibo makes their pizzas with those "brick oven blisters" on 'em, this means that the remaining slices all had that watery charcoal flavor that tastes like the cooled-down grill you licked on a dare while drunk last Memorial Day.The funghi pizza was passable.  The mushrooms did a good job of hiding a lot of the issues (mainly the sauce) that the margherita pizza had.  It too, however, decided that it should freeze up like the surface of Hoth (sans tauntaun innards) after the first slices were taken.Fifteen minutes after we'd decided that we were done eating soggy pizza, our server decided to stop by our table again.  After all, the folks who were seated ten minutes after we were had completed their dessert, so she realized that she should probably see how our meal was going.  Drinks that had sat un-refilled since our appetizer was served were topped off without warning, and she walked away again, our napkin-covered plates still waiting to be picked up.  "Do you want any dessert..." she muttered in an almost muted tone after a different waitress cleared our table.  We said no and asked for the check.  Seven minutes later, she remembered to bring over the check.We paid in cash and got the heck out of Dodge, wondering how so many people could have led us wrong, how the place stayed so busy, and if maybe, our taste buds had betrayed us.  After all, the denizens of the Arizona Republic, Yelp, and even "Check Please! Arizona" had vouched for this place, to say nothing of our friends and work acquaintances.  We decided that there's a massive conspiracy going on, and Cibo has either paid you all off, or laces their food with hypnotic suggestion drugs to which we are somehow impervious.The food is bad. The service is awful. Stay away.~~#~0
I am so sick after eating here today. The plates and silverware were dirty. I tried to ignore it and just eat the food. The tomatoes were brown. I asked our server if they were meant to be that color and she replied surely yes. It is now 5 hours later and I am puking my meal up and have no appetite.  My boyfriend is just as sick and we will never go back.~~#~0
Hit every one of my pet peeves about contractors:Did not return first call, took two calls,He told me to send email and he would follow upTook two emails and another callHe came out to look at work I needed done, said would send estimate.No callI emailed him again asking about estimate - was told "can't do it, flat on my back" and never heard from him again.If you can't be relied on to return calls and follow up - how can one trust you to be reliable once work has started?~~#~0
The coffee is great but the service is TERRIBLE! Waited 25 minutes as 4th in line because the barista is chatting to his peeps and going slower than a slug in ice. The counter crew needs to lose the attitude and realize good service is what keeps customers. There are other great coffee shops like Lux and Drip in Phoenix. I will not go back to Cartel.~~#~0
I've avoided yelping this place for a reason; that reason is that it sucks just as badly as their other location in the Hilton Village. The food is horrible, the  diners are mostly douches and although this location features less popped collars than the one in SDL I cannot figure out for the life of me why certain people and bloggers can claim this as some of the best pizza in the Valley. Sub-par food, service and experience in both locations.~~#~0
Everyone on the planet darn near has visited McDonald's. It's worldly icon and it will probably be the first form of food to be available on the ISS (International Space Station) which I think is only fitting! However there is a problem that "McD's" needs to fix before "they boldly go where no burger has gone before." McD's management at the store level and at the corporate level need to train their employees on how to get an order correct when it comes to what the customer says they want. Now I'm not saying don't up sell apple pies and drinks but the people who work in drive through and in-store need to really listen to the customer and hear what they want! When I go to McD's drive thru or in-store I like to order a "Quarter Pounder" an original "core" sandwich at McD's. The Quarter Pounder was invented in 1971. When I place my order the employee always ask me do I want cheese on it? I say no and they turn and tell the cook "One Quarter Ham" please. Now I have learned over the years of ordering at McD's how to order to get exactly what I want, so I figured I would say what the order taker would say to the cook to get what I wanted. Sounds pretty simple to me...Not so fast! The order taker still ask me if I wanted cheese on my burger.So when I return another time and I order my Quarter Pounder I say "may I have a Quarter Ham please" and what does the employee do? Ask me if I want cheese!!! I say no again! Then they turn around and say "One Quarter Ham!" What's up with that? I ask for for a burger in McDonald's employee terminology and the employee disregards the terminology and hears only what they want to hear.Then to top things off they want to charge me the same price for a Qtr Ham as a Qtr Ham with cheese which makes no sense to me! So when I inquire about the differences in prices or lack there of, the employees tell me that they must charge me the same price for a "Quarter Ham" as a "Quarter Pounder with Cheese" there is no pricing difference. Why not??? (Considering a regular hamburger cost one price and their regular cheeseburger cost is a little more because of the cheese being added.) By me not adding cheese to my sandwich the employee has to do more keystrokes than the single one touch entry for a Quarter Pounder with cheese! More work= more time in line for the employee and the customer.I know I'm crazy for blogging about this but if nothing is said people will not get what they want when they go to McD's and that's not right and I really do enjoy the food there. I have been going since I was a little kid with my father and brother and it was a weekly treat and I have done the same with my son some 30+ years later. What your training your employees to do is not good customer service this is cattle herding!!! The days of customer service have all but dissolved away and as a corporate entity you know this and instead of going back to what got you where you are today you change your own corporate model and do business as usual!!!On a side note! if your going to put someone in drive-thru, put someone there who speaks intelligable english. I could barely understand the girl working in the drive-thru and I also speak spanish and when I realised it would be better to talk to her in spanish she dismissed my ability to order in spanish and used English but when I'm in the store (same transaction because something was wrong with my order) I heard someone make their order in spanish and she spoke it back to the customer for the whole transaction! Can a brotha that speaks spanish not be slightly discriminated against because I don't look like I come from a spanish speaking country???~~#~0
First and Last Visit. I went here with my mom as she was craving a burger. She had a bacon burger and a drink. I had a grilled cheese with jalapenos, some cajun fries, and a drink. What you notice visually at  first are the multiple, pasted-everywhere signs about how great they are. Red flag. The music was blaring so loud, and was quite a turn-off.  We found our way to the order counter, passing by the big bags of peanuts. Really? In a burger joint? Ordered, attempted to eat inside, but due to the music went outside. There are way too many fries in the order. The cajun seasoning was sparse at best. Mom said her bacon burger was good. My cheese sandwich was ok, and I liked having the jalapeno choice to put on it. I have to tell you I am unimpressed with this place. I think having the choices to put on your burgers/sandwiches are nice but the presentation was lackluster. Every order is placed in a bag as a to-go order, even if you're eating at the restaurant.~~#~0
I don't know what all the hype is about this place.I find their deserts pretty disgusting, and i have tried numerous ones because so many people rave about them.  They have all tasted like metal, and the cookies are always dry and hard on the outside and chewy on the inside.  I like my cookies to have a consistent texture.They don't have any vegan options.Their coffee is horrible.  It always tastes burnt, and they charge $.75 for soy.  Most places no longer charge for soy, or if they do it is $.25.  I feel $.75 is exorbitant.I am done giving this place one more shot.~~#~0
This business operates like it's 1950. I went in to buy some Italian sausage and a sandwich and my bill was about $9.00. I was told I could not pay for it unless I spent $10.00. I was not offered any type of alternative. I was just looked at by a double digit IQ moron behind the counter with a blank stare. How do places like this operate in 2011? They at least should have someone in there who has more than a GED slinging grub.~~#~0
Back to my belief that service needs to weigh heaviest on expectations in the "service industry," I've got to share an experience at Local Breeze from a recent visit.  My friend ordered a salad without the bacon, but the kitchen apparently missed this request and made it the normal way.Fair enough.... accidents happen. But as we then tried getting the server's attention to fix the situation, he was less than responsive. Finally, after my friend had picked around at her salad for a while and the rest of us finished our meals, the waiter insisted on bringing a new salad. My friend declined the replacement since it had already taken so long and asked, instead, that it be removed from the check. After much ado from the service staff/manager, this was the agreed upon solution.But when the check came, there was a miscellaneous charge of $6.... That was for the portion of the salad that our friend ate. Serious!?!?!? The restaurant would not back down from this position, so they got our $6 and will not likely get another dime. Ever.Too bad... Local Breeze otherwise seems like a nice place with decent food. If only they were better at being a restaurant, I would fully support them.~~#~0
I was craving great pizza and this place was recommended by a friend so I went to check it out. The service was awful and was given by high schoolers who obviously had more important things to be doing. I think they must of screwed up the batch of sauce because it was so sweet I couldn't even have bite number 2. I don't like sweet marinara or pizza sauce. The party I was with was a bit less picky but needless to say we didn't box the left overs which were plentiful.~~#~0
Shithole full of drama queens~~#~0
Played the Wigwam golf courses during my stay in the valley.  They are by far in the worst condition I have ever seen a course.  The locals have nicknamed it The Pigwam, and members I spoke to are outraged by the new ownership/management's apparent lack of interest in the courses conditions.  The greens were not puttable, punched and sanded but not rolled or cut.  Very little grass in the fairways, and the rough is nothing but weeds of varying heights.  One of the courses is so wet, mowers and golf carts have left huge tire ruts in the muddy rough.  Tree limbs down for days.  Grass growing in all the bunkers.   Large areas of dirt around the greens.  I played several other courses in the valley during my stay, and all were near pristine, with only minor seasonal issues.  Save your money and play elsewhere.~~#~0
Been going here for 23 years... Never clean... Last night was the worst filth I've ever experienced and may never return. If the bathrooms and eating area is that bad... What's going on in the kitchen?~~#~0

Worst meal I've had in a long time.Was here on a very slow Tuesday night, there were maybe 10 other patrons. Seated promptly. Our server told my date the specials while I was in the restroom, I got to hear the last one before he walked away. Nice. He returns to take our drink order, repeats it. Walks away. Returns with chips/salsa and my dates beer. No margarita for mama, I think maybe the bartender can't keep up with to 10 people here. Nope. Server forgot. Cuz he's so slammed, right?  We ask for more salsa, which finally comes with my drink. The chips are stale and the salsa is just blah, but we are starving.  After what seems like forever server comes back around offers to get my date another beer. Ignores my empty glass and tells us that our order should be next. 10 minutes later the food arrives. We can immediately tell it's been sitting for a long time. Plate is extremely hot and the food has a thick hard outside, cold in the middle. My meatloaf was dry, hard and flavorless. Potatoes might have been good had they been served within 20 minutes of being ready. My date's meal was also overcooked and bland.I checked in via yelp and there was a free dessert offer, which I decided against since the rest of the meal sucked. No need to waste my daily calories on more sub par and disappointing food.Slow/inattentive server+bad food= no return visit for me. Ever.I think most of the reviews praising the cuisine and service have to be after several of  their "limit 2" margaritas have been consumed.~~#~0
Hospice of the Valley for someone with dementia. They will drug your loved one up so much that they fall into a comma and then 10 to 15 days later will die of dehydration. Although your loved one's quality of life was zero there is a difference for the person that signed the paperwork allowing it to happen and when God allows it to happen. End of life care is hard on the person who signs and people should know this is what they are signing before it happens.~~#~0
Took a guest to Abuelo's for dinner. I was very embarrassed. First off, the atmosphere was nice. Very unique! Our service was great but there was not a lot of people there. The chips were good but the salsa tasted like they squirted Macayo's taco sauce into a bowl and called it fresh!( My guest came up with this comparison!)  My guest had a steak fajita chimi plate that came with rice and beans. The presentation was gorgeous! The cheese sauce on top tasted like the canned Nacho cheese sauce you might get at a state fair. In fact...my guest said that was all he could taste! The refried beans were very bland. No lard for sure! The rice resembled a Chinese fried rice which was just weird!  He hated it so much that he didn't eat much. I had the steak Fajita's which were supposed to be marinated.(NOT)! It was over cooked(some spots were even burnt and crunchy) fatty cheap steak. My guess, Flank or Skirt steak! The veggies under it were not Mexican! They consisted of broccoli, zucchini, yellow squash, a few peppers and a lot of onions. It was served with a bowl of pinto beans. They were soupy and tasted like liquid smoke! I didn't eat much of my dinner either! I have traveled many places and dined in many exquisite establishments. This in no way resembled Mexican or Spanish cuisine in any way.  Just gross and VERY over priced!http://spoonfulpersuasion.blogspot.com/~~#~0
The reviews of Zoe's Kitchen so far have been more than generous. Yep, it has cute decor but other than that it's some of the worst food I've ever eaten. I would give it zero stars, but Yelp won't allow that so I had to give it one.My partner and I ate here and both wound up getting very ill. We each missed a day of work and he was so sick they have to put him on an I.V.Stay away.~~#~0
We went in just before the lunch rush. We sat down and our drink orders were taken. It took another 15 minutes for our food order to be taken. I will say that in that 15 minutes the lunch rush came in, so we understood. However, there was not apology or acknowledgment of our extended wait. We saw several of the parties that came in after us served before we received our food. About 25 minutes after our order was taken we received our food. Just as we saw two parties who came in after us headed out the door.  We were finally asked how the food was by an employee (not our waitress) and after telling him about our experience. We were told the full kitchen staff was working, but the wait staff was short. He said he did not know why it took so long for us to be served.  Our main problem was the lack  of apology or acknowledgment.  I really wish I had a pen so I could tell them that the two dollar tip that was left was not an indicator of how cheap I was, but how bad the service was. As for the food, i was good, but not amazing. It definitely was not good enough for me to forgive the faults and try this place again.~~#~0
Blah Blah..Where do I begin?? Well lets start off with the basics. This used to be a Bravi Pizza joint on the Northwest corner of Germann & Gilbert just off the SanTan 202 loop... AS for the food.. My wife and I ordered the "combo" app.. It had Zukes, Mozz Cheese sticks and Onion Rings.. Not bad, interesting flavors of batter. Served with ranch. Oh they served some sort of bread thing with a little garlic or something.. Stale and cold. The only thing that was warm was the marinara.. We ordered a 14" pizza with pepperoni.. The umm pizza showed up GREASY.. Above and below.. Sauce or crust or cheese or roni's were salty, or all the above. The crust had a flavor of garlic butter, at least we think it did.I hate to give 1 star for my first time ever at a SNY, but next time we will go to Patsy Grimaldi's instead and stick with REAL pizza! We won't be going back anytime ever!~~#~0
umm, so i was really stoked to try this place, and stopped by there one day after class. terrible parking situation, i had no idea where to park and didnt want to get towed. after driving around for 10 minutes trying to figure out which way was out and where i could park tow-free, i walked up and was extremely confused as to where the door to get in was. the one i tried to open was locked, and another one up front said use other door. it really bothers me when business are a.) difficult to find and b.) difficult to get in to.three roots. FAIL.~~#~0
There was a "For Rent" sign on the door as of 7/15/12.~~#~0

(  o  ) (  o  )    Boobies = cool.   Hooters = stupid crappy place.   Food sucks. Chicks are stupid. Having some cleavage showing does not give them a free pass when it comes to poor service.   I didn't pick this place, a buddy of mine did.  That bastard, I might not talk to him anymore.  I never understood the pantyhose with the shorts, what no talent ass clown in upper management came up with that brilliant marketing ploy?~~#~0
For this review, I will simply cut/paste my letter I sent to Lexus regarding my recent 60,000 mile "service." Simply put, if you don't mind paying $600 for a "service", then feel free to use these criminals."We recently had a 60,000 mile service performed at Bell Lexus in Phoenix. I am completely appalled at the prices your company and this dealer charged us. $386.82 for what amounts to a glorified oil change. I feel like I need a police officer, since I was just robbed. There is nothing done in this service that isn't done by a standard Jiffy Lube oil change for $40.Labor costs of $257.40 for a couple hours (if that much) of checking and topping off fluids!!?? Is this some kind of sick joke??$125 to program a key that already cost us hundreds of dollars??? 10 seconds of typing onto a keyboard for $125??My total bill breakdown is $444.90 of labor, $169.37 parts. (that include some oil and 2 wiper blades)Another $40 of "misc charges". I am appalled, and will NEVER visit any Lexus dealer for any kind of service again. And I will post my bill information on every review site I can find. Your company should be ashamed and embarassed. And no, some kid in a tux with a muffin and coffee when I arrive does NOT help.Jeff ClayInvoice # LECS210612Invoice date 6/23/10"~~#~0
I've gotta agree with Jesse on the only other review.  HOW IS THIS GYM STILL IN BUSINESS?The manager is your classic gym jackass that makes people who work at gyms look bad.  Pushy, dishonest gym membership sales.  I've seen a personal trainer and the manager ogle girls, rarely see them doing any work.A few of the front desk staff were cool.  Just very underpaid and obviously passing through.The men's locker room is disgusting.  No joke, more than half the equipment is broken or has something wrong with it.I do believe about 80% of the problem is with the manager.  A quick renovation and new management could do wonders for this spot.Why did I keep going?  Convenience and locked into a 1 year employee benefit type membership.  I visited the gym about 40 times over 5 months while I was recovering from injury and at least it has a pool, 2 large jacuzzis (jet therapy), steam room, and free weights...when they are operable.  I can't tell you how many times I've seen customers waiting out front with no one out at the front desk.One Sunday morning no one on staff bothered to show up to open the gym.  I eventually just left after 45 minutes, who knows when they finally showed up.  I saw about 40 members either waiting or came and left.Worst. Gym (Management). Ever.~~#~0
Worst pizza hut I have ever been to. We have given it several chances and no dice. The main problem is the fact that this location never seems to honor any deals that are in ads and If they do it's more expensive.~~#~0

Apparently these guys hate women. After having my car for three weeks and doing no work on it, I made the mistake of asking when my car would be finished. I was told by Whitey that "they didn't need my business, they had plenty of work."  I was also given less than 24 hrs to get my car off their lot or they would have it impounded. Another $70 out of my pocket. I asked to speak to the owner, who called me back later and left me a message stating " they were sick of me dicking them around and he was giving me the best customer service in the Valley". He claimed i was "dicking him around" because I did not pay in full for repairs BEFORE the car was worked on. They also refused to give me my keys until I paid $60 for having my car towed in. These guys are rude and seriously suprised there in business if what I recieved was there best customer service.~~#~0
It's closed CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED.  GET IT OUT OF HERE~~#~0
My husband and I had heard great things about this place, so we ventured over there this morning. It was a rainy Sunday morning, and the place was packed (which was definitely a good sign).  We inquired about the wait and were told it would be 10-15 minutes.  Thirty minutes later, I was turning into a slightly friendlier version of the Incredible Hulk, and we were finally seated.  Upon being seated, the waiter took our drink orders and walked away with my menu (I know that was not on purpose, but it definitely didn't help the wait). We ordered coffee, which tasted like dirty brown water. When we asked about the other types of coffee (it says they have a gourmet flavor of the day), I was given an option that didn't sound great so I ordered an orange juice (definitely not fresh squeezed, mine was still fizzing from being poured out of the machine). I ordered a bacado omelet and the cinnamon bun that I heard they are famous for. My husband ordered a bacon eye opener combo with pancakes.  I had been told that the cinnamon bun would be there first, so I was pleasantly surprised when our food arrived within five minutes of being ordered.   My pleasant surprise quickly turned to disgust when I noticed that the plate I had been served on was crusted with old food (egg yolks, avocado or spinach, and an assortment of other things).  I let my waiter know and he took it away to get fixed.  I assumed that even at the worst they would put the food on a different plate, even if they didn't refire the whole order. Nope. They brought me the same plate, which they had just wiped off (I could tell by the oily feel of the edge and the chip on the corner). To make matters worse, my food had gotten cold by that point and they hadn't bothered to reheat it.  The cheese on the omelet had completely congealed, and try as I might I could not locate the brie that was supposed to be in there. Needless to say I was completely turned off by the meal. Meanwhile, my husband had received his meal and had not gotten any syrup. We waited around a while before someone finally brought it.  Quite a while later, the server asked if I still wanted the cinnamon bun because he had forgotten about it. When I said yes, he informed me that he would have to reheat it, because it had been sitting there for a while.  When I got it, it definitely tasted like it had been reheated and had been sitting around drying out for a long time.  The only positive thing I can say about this place is that they serve good bacon, because my husband was kind enough to share a bite of his meal with me.  We heard similar grumbles all around us while we ate. A man at the table behind us asked my husband for his syrup, because he had asked the server for it three times. Another guy sent his glasses back because they were dirty.  I watched a busboy drop eggs all over the floor while wiping down a table and not bothering to pick it up.  Next time we have a craving for brunch, we'll visit the local breeze, (or heck even IHOP is usually better than that).~~#~0
Dishonest don't trust them or go there. Told my elderly parents they needed a new AC system. All they needed was a few dollars worth of freon.  Dishonest~~#~0
At this store on Sunday, I was paying for a pair of men's running pants with a price tag of $59.99.   The clerk rang them up and said that the total was $71.  That would indicate quite a hefty tax on the item.  I questioned the total, and it turned out that the pants had rung up for $64.99, not the price on the tag.  The clerk ran a credit for the difference, but didn't volunteer that such a price discrepancy shouldn't have occurred or indicate that she would check into the matter further.  I wonder how many other people have been overcharged on this item, or will be in the future. Another deceptive practice of this business:  I had been by the store on another occasion and had asked a salesperson about the return policy on pants I was considering buying for my husband.   She said that there was no problem, just bring them back within 30 days.  I've just looked at today's receipt, and it says that gear can be returned "for an exchange or store credit."  There is no chance at all for a simple, uncomplicated return, and clerks at this store should be clear about that fact when they are asked.  On the receipt, the store claims that its return policy is "awesome."   Hmm, not so much. . .~~#~0
This place is pretty sketch.~~#~0

It pains me to write this review. I'm hurting. But, I must yelp the truth. Let's start with the positive because I want more than anything to feel good about Kachina Dry Cleaners. The location is good (40th st and Indian School) and I love the kitsch of their name and the sign. It's so old Arizona that I wanted so much to love them.The woman who (I think) owns the joint is SO SWEET. I just love her. She's always happy and you leave thinking that your clothes will be in the tenderest of care. I also have made up this story that she and her husband moved out here in 1950 and opened up this dry cleaners on the outskirts of Phoenix and her husband has passed away, but she carries on the business. (Understand that I've made all of that up in my head.)There are two OTHER women there though that are the most unpleasant creatures I've ever come into contact with. I've tried. Seriously. I've often pulled up, sat in the car and screwed up every bit of nice I had in my body to try and get them (especially one) to smile back. But, no. I get a downright grimace, no eye contact and barely an utterance. Oh, I've tried!!!! Plus, they always need at least three days. Then, they lost my clothes once. Someone ELSE had picked up my clothes. But, I kept going back because I just love the owner. So, I'm sorry, Kachina Dry Cleaners lady. I love you. And I want to support you. But, I can't.~~#~0
This restaurant is made for people who don't really know Arabic food, specifically, the kind that eat hummus with potato chips. You will not see real Mediterranean folks eating here. It's a joke. The hummus shouldn't be called hummus, a gyro without tzatziki sauce shouldn't be called a gyro, and falafel served out of a box shouldn't be called falafel!  Especially when the batter is super OLD and tastes like last decade's gingerbread.I was surprised to hear a Syrian started this place up -- especially when I didn't see a single Arab in the kitchen! This explains the lousy food. Everything here tasted like it came out of a box, a Trader Joes plastic tub, or a Costco bag! SHAME. I looked around to see what other people were ordering, and it became crystal clear that the majority simply came to order drinks -- knowing the food sucks.~~#~0
I was visiting AZ from California yesterday and a colleague recommended this sushi place.  It was terrible.  The service was slow. I even told our waiter we were in a hurry and we still waited 40 minutes for one of the rolls only to find out the chef dropped the roll and had to remake it.  Would not recommend.~~#~0
Way over priced for the quality. I thought it was nasty. Made me gag. Didn't like what I got nor what my husband got. I'm pretty picky though...I don't even like serranos.~~#~0
Just wanted a small cup of coffee.  Maybe it was old but pH was low enough to etch metal.  The soy milk they added curdled upon impact.  I had one sip and tossed it immediately.  I won't go back.  Where can one get good coffee and not a blended drink?~~#~0
My family and I tried to eat dinner at Genghis tonight and where very disappointed.  My husband is allergic to gluten and we checked them out online before going and they where suppose to be very accommodating.  When our server came to our table we made it clear of his food allergy, when we made the food we made it clear to the lady helping you load your bowl, and when we got to the grill we told the cook about his food allergy and even asked for it to be made with rice.  The cook was suppose to cook his food separate of all the other gluten dinners so as not to contaminate his but the cook just threw it on the grill with everything else.  We told our water and he said he would correct the problem but when his dinner came it was with noodles witch contain gluten and would have made him sick.  In the end my husband left hungry and I left mad.  The service was bad and the place felt like a fast food restaurant.  I love Mongolian grills but my food was disappointing and even without the food allergy mix up I would not wast my money and go back.  They did offer us a free desert but they looked bad and contained GLUTEN.~~#~0
In just a couple of words... Absolutely horrible! Worst wings I have ever had and shameful overall experience for a place that specializes in wings. Do not waste your money here as there are many places to go where you can get quality wings, homemade, and fairly priced. Enough said.~~#~0
This is a place to stay away from.  Because they have been in business so long they think they can do what they want to the customers.  Despite the staff recommending a shoe as a good tap shoe, and despite the owner putting taps on the shoe, when it didn't work for the dancer as a tap shoe, the owner not only refused to stand behind the sale of the shoe and his workmanship, but he was rude about not making things right.  In a day in age when online shopping is quick and convenient, retail stores should be bending over backwards to be helpful to their customers.  Barry is not.  Stay away from Dee's Dancewear.  Poor Dee would be sick to see her sons doing such a lousy job with her namesake.  Shame on them!~~#~0
My husband and I just moved into the neighborhood, not far from this restaurant.  The week we moved in, we took his parents to try this place in hopes of it being a new favorite Chinese food place.  It was a complete waste of money and a total disappointment.The layout is similar to that of Panda Express, but the food is far from edible.  The portions ARE big, I'll give them that, but they have to make up for the lack of taste somewhere.  We all felt sick after eating there and we'll never go back.~~#~0
I've lost all faith in Trader Joe's at this point. They are supposed to be all about the customer experience but I guess that's not profitable anymore. I sent an email to customer service and even though it says I will receive and email back, I never did. Apparently my experience is the norm and negative shopping experiences do not get acknowledged or addressed.~~#~0

So, I have this habit of taking all of my slacks and suits to the cleaners at once and it has never ever came back to bite me in the ass. That was until I found out this past Friday night that I would have to be present for an important meeting the following day and of course I would need to be dressed accordingly as usual. Damn. It's 8 PM on a Friday evening and I must get a pair of slacks as quickly as possible. I had heard of Burlington Coat Factory carrying KC, RL amongst a few others so I figured I'd give it a try seeing as though I simply needed a basic black slack. The store locator directs me to Arizona Mills Mall as it has the closest Burlington Coat Factory to Chandler, so off I go.Before I even get inside of the damn store I notice some idiot in a lime green thugmobile actually following me around the parking lot. I'm not talking about the two of us turning down the same aisle either...I am talking about deliberately driving in circles and hitting the same aisle three times only to see this guy's grille in my rearview the entire time. You know, some real Simon Sez kind of bullshit. He had followed me all of the way from Baseline & I-10 to the mall's parking lot only to continue following me, so of course, I am immediately thinking "Okay, what is this sorry bastard thinking of carjacking me or something?"After finally reaching the point to where I was really concerned and about losing my patience I decide to abruptly park in the middle of the lot surrounded by no one. I sat ready and willing to surprise the shit out of this foolish bastard when he finally decides to go and park up in front of the store near the other cars. He gets out and sees me looking directly at him and clearly judging by his body language he is aware that he has been detected and is being watched.I watch him go into the mall and purposely walk over past his thugmobile to check his plates. I actually enjoyed this part. Little did I know this would be the high point of my shopping experience at this place. I go inside and see the store packed with people that I want no where near me and a staff and store layout that is clearly oriented towards theft prevention.And to think I called myself avoiding the hustle and bustle by not going to Chandler Fashion Mall. In hindsight, clearly I would have been much less annoyed had I just taken my happy ass to Chandler Fashion Mall as the congestion there is much more tolerable than what lied ahead at Arizona Mills Mall.Anyway, I got the damn slacks and got the hell out, but if I could describe Arizona Mills Mall in two words they would be: "Umm, no."~~#~0
I can no longer hold myself back from speaking out against this unscrupulous tire dealer. Yes, J J is a true professional but his boss, Ralph, the owner, leaves a lot to be desired. I started doing business with C & R Tire back in July 21, 2009. I bought a set of 4 tires for my pick up. I continued to buy several sets of tires from C & R up to July 2010 for my trucks. We then started having tire failure problems and this is when the owner got involved and destroyed any hope of any future business from me. The tires started to form bubbles on the side wall or the thread itself. This is not just one tire but every single one we bought. The last set failed this week. So far I have replaced 10 tires that I bought from C & R over the time period all with the same defective problem, bubbles on the side wall or thread. Upon the first 2 occurrences, I called C & R. JJ put me on to Ralph, the owner. The answer from Ralph was it was not their problem. It was a road hazard and we were not covered. In his own words, I will never forget this because I wrote it down "You buy the lowest quality tire we have and you don't buy the road hazard protection, what do you expect". Basically, he was telling me that his lower priced tires do not meet the standards of the road without the extra warranty. Road hazards happened to all the tires I bought from C & R . I now buy my tires from another reputable and well know dealer in town and I can tell you that I do not have to worry about the tires, they stand behind their products. I have not had one tire failure from this other dealer. All tires from C & R failed. Can that be just a coincidence. I don't think so.~~#~0
I have had way better chinese food. Not fresh and bad stomach aches later at night. Sick- not overeating. Good walnut shrimp.~~#~0
All I can say about this place is save your money!!! If you are looking for ambiance and terrible food, this is the place.  I have waited a long time to try a Rainforest Cafe and I was really disappointed!  The food around us did not look appealing so we ordered the appetizer platter.  The artichoke spinach dip was so thick and overcooked that the chips kept breaking.  The mozzarella sticks were overcooked and the cheese was rubbery. The chicken egg roll things were awful and had some kind of funky sauce. The chicken tenders were probably the most edible thing on the plate.  I still think for $15.99 this appetizer plater was not a deal!  We had also called and made a reservation for a booth by the waterfall and of course when we got there there were no booths left! So don't waste your time with reservations!  I really would like to say something nice about the place but between the food and service, I won't be back!!~~#~0
Wow! So I work at a prison and I've had inmate meals occasionally, so there is a certain standard of food and taste that I have developed. It's really not that hard to please me with food, especially after having prison food but Sam's cafe really questioned whether or not I was an inmate that night. I ordered one of their specials, which was the pork enchiladas. When I got the tray, I initially thought they had mistaken the dish for a three rolled tacos, with mole-like sauce? First I had to decipher if it was fried, which was later confirmed. Then the sauce on top was definitely something that you cannot label. It had a sweet, mole, yet bitter taste, with sour cream that was light and fluffy and made it look like whip cream. I know . . . strange you say? The pork was dried out and even the two of us could not finish this one meal that was split. The beans tasted hallow, if that's even possible and the rice was extra dry. I am sorry to give this such a harsh review, but it's the truth and sometimes the truth hurts. I have to say they do have great margaritas and the best part was the complimentary white chocolate, pecan thing they gave at the end. Sorry Sam's but this will be my first and last time.~~#~0
We have ate here a few times, this visit was one of the worst experiences we have had in a long time.  The host who sat us (2+our baby) was very rude, acted like we were inconviencing him by coming in. (Took about 5 minutes before he even came to sit us).  He also clearly saw our baby however didn't offer a booster or a high chair.   He did however give us a kids coloring menu (but they don't have crayons??? Really?)  The waitress was also in some type of mood and for some reason decided to take a job at a brewery knowing nothing about beer.  I asked what wheat beers they had, she suggested a house beer---umm, not a wheat at all....food took about 30-40min after ordering to come...awesome with a restless baby and no crayons...  terrible experience (crappy employees, took to long, burger was really dry, waitress dosent know anout beers at a brewery, no crayons for their kids coloring menus)... ohh I also forgot to add the floors in the restaurant was disgusting, looked like it hadent been swept or moped in quite some time.....bathroom was much worse....   what a waste of a trip~~#~0
Arrived to check in at 6:30pm and was told my room wasn't ready yet! Only request I had was for a quiet room, so of course they put me facing the main street. Besides the traffic noise, the idiots next door were hanging out outside talking loud until I finally got up about 10:30pm and asked them if they were serious! Seems like that's the type of hotel this is. TV was a joke it was so small and old. I wouldn't use the pool if I was on fire! And I wouldn't stay here again if it was free and I was homeless!!!~~#~0
Canned peas and carrots in shrimp with lobster sauce.  Service was friendly but it couldn't overcome what was quite possibly the worst Chinese food I've ever had.~~#~0
Was there on 4/1 for a birthday party.  Bowling alley was great.  Restaurant not so much..  ordered carne asada fries, quesadilla with green chile, taquitos and 2 pizzas.  The fries were edible but had little carne asada on them. Quesadilla was edible.  Forgot my taquitos and when I finally got them they tasted like overcooked frozen food.  We were not given any salsa, napkins, plates, we had to hunt them down.  The pizzas were bad versions of red baron frozen pizza's.  The tastes was pretty bad even for frozen pizzas.  Overall we were the only customers at the time yet took close to 45 minutes to get the food.  I would give it zero stars but that wasn't possible.~~#~0
SOOO Disguesting...  cool idea, but nasty, and the food does not even taste good.  I felt sick after 1/2 of my burger and I would not let my daughter eat hers at all.~~#~0
The biggest mistake Solis made was when they noticed a spot on my mammogram and then didn't inform me about it.  I later felt the lump, which turned out to be cancerous, and only then did I discover that the lump had been noticed by Solis 9 months earlier.  I advise everyone to get copies of all your records and look at the images yourself.~~#~0
i have to put up a disclaimer stating i did not actually partake of their pizza.  but the reason i could not taste it was because i waited 4 hours total and the hostess was extremely rude when we checked on the wait time and basically stated we could not get a table.  after 4 freakin' hours waiting, are you friggin' kidding me?  i don't care how good the pizza is, with service so poorand inconsiderate i don't ever want to eat there.  our group was supposed to eat there on a saturday night, so i stayed in line for 40 minutes and finally it was my turn.  the hostess informed me the wait would be 3-31/2 hours, which made me think " WTF?this pizza better be damned good.  in fact, it better be the best frickin' pizza i've ever had."  i had a guinness over at the pub next door, andwhen we checked with the hostess, she told us we had to wait 3 more hours in no uncertain terms.  i always felt this place was over-hyped, but i wanted to taste it for myself to see what all the buzz was about.  our group ended up checking out an asian tapas bar to kill time.  when we came back 2 hours later, the hostess snapped at me like we were supposed to stand there and wait like idiots for the whole 3 hours.   even if we had waited at the bar next door, was there a way she could let us know our table was ready without us checking in with her?  there was no pager system, so forgive me if i'm a bit confused.   i don't believe there is a pizza worth waiting 4 hours for.that's the problem with pizzeria bianco, the glowing reviews have made them busier than they can handle, and the service does not befitthe best in america rating because the food is still relatively inexpensive pizza and they don't hire servers that are up to par at the elite level. IMHO they should be handing out complimentary antipasti like salumi in seattle and apologizing for the unusually long wait.  but they don't have to, because pheonicians enjoy getting treated like dog crap i guess.  i'll be one person that won't ever go there again.~~#~0
This store is so suburban 1998.  Everything is embellished or bedazzled.  The woman who owns the place is probably one of the rudest people i have ever met in my life.  She is about 68 years old and dresses like she is 12.  The prices are very high.  Don't waste your money or time.~~#~0
This was one of those restaurants that you knew was bound to fail in 18 mos. great location but completely over priced.  their signature cheese steak sandwich was 'steakums' minced to nothing w/ some pieces of onion and a couple of green pepper pieces throughout.  All this for $8  I brought my daughter there and her chicken fingers and drink and my sandwich and drink and fries was over $20....    not in this town ... there are just too many other options where you get a better value for your buck .  Just keepin ' it real.~~#~0
Unphogettable price, phorgettable taste!~~#~0
Managers need to help the staff at lunch time. Horrible service.~~#~0
2 things:1) Ive had better sandwiches at Subway. Their bread is stale, meat is dry, and if you get a sandwich "Mike's way" they *smother* it in oil and vinegar.2) There were ants all over the drink counter and IN THE NOZZLES. My husband pushed the button for Sprite and got Sprite w/ a power boost of live ants in his glass.Dirty place, bad food.~~#~0
US Airways knows nothing about customer service and refuses to correct, and admint they were wrong.  Their flight attendant Bambi wet out of her wany to berate me in fromt of all the other passengers because I didn't have a pen on board.  I wrote US Airways explaining that I am a passenger and the one thing I do not deserve is a horribly rude flight attendant.  US Airways refused to even apologise for the situation and kept sending response letters that had nothing to do with what I wanted.I warn everyone that Bambi on US Airways flight 1966 from Charlotte to Punta Cana to stear clear of her, she will ruin you flight and vacation.  US Airways got my money and refuses to refund it.~~#~0
Straight from Wal-Mart to your plate.  This was the most disappointing meal I've had in ages.  I watched the staff pull retail boxes of breadded fish from a freezer in the middle of the kitchen and serve them up.  The portions were adequate, but not outsanding.Throughout my 20+ years in the Valley I've heard Pete's was a great fish-n-chips place, but yikes!   Looks like i'm stuck with LJS for my fish and chips fix.I'll never visit again.~~#~0
The only reason I've continued to go to this office was for Peggy DeCarolis.  She is (or was) completely, undeniably the best part of this office.  Now she's no longer there.  She was probably too nice and thorough and caring for this office.  They won't give you any info on where she went either which is kind of weird.  The few times I did actually see Dr. Wilson I had to wait about an hour.  And the appointment took about 10 mins each time.  She did not act like she gave a rat's ass about me or my problems.  One time for a consult she basically told me to do what I wanted to do...the whole reason for the consult was to get her obviously-more-educated-than-I-in-gynecology-department opinion.  Ugh.  Whatev.Now I have to find a new gynecologist.  Peggy where are you?!??!!~~#~0
The first warning sign should have been the fact that this place was practically dead at 9 pm on a Saturday night. From previous Yelpers, I was prepared for the complete and total lack of authenticity for a so-called Irish pub... but I was not prepared for cold food and having to constantly fend off the drunk and/or homeless people who unabashedly walk right up to the table and brazenly harass you or ask for your leftovers. Some may find this kitschy. I do not. Really, this place deserves less than one star. It gets a quarter-star for our poor server, who seemed sweet and somewhat embarrassed about the goings-on. It gets another quarter-star for the seasoned waffle fries, which were probably totally delicious when they were hot.Bleh.~~#~0
We went there last weekend, it was very loud and the food was poor.  The fish taco's were poor, the fish must have been old and not fresh.  We will never go there again~~#~0
HORRIBLE... underscore HORRIBLE.  While visiting Scottsdale we happened upon the Culinary Dropout on the corner of an upscale shopping area.  Our waiter highly recommened the Fried Chicken and the Rainbow Trout.  UGH!   The Fried Chicken was too greasy and upon slicing into a piece a river of grease poured out.   My rainbow trout was dry and overcooked with a hard crust on the outside.  It required using a knife to cut into the fish... who ever heard of such a need with a delictable fish.  On top of the fish were green beans from your grocers freezer section and a handful of sliced almonds and voila!!! you have a $19.00 dish without flavor, delicate  texture, and care in the cooking.  These dropouts should be fired or sent to retake  their highschool Home Economics class. I give this restaurant a thumbs down .  There are so many other wonderful restaurants in Scottsdale with fun ambiance to enjoy.... don't bother stopping here.~~#~0
Area was convinient but the hotel was way over priced! Arrived to room and the hall way had NO AC felt like a heater. THen the toilent was stopped up and took them 5 hours to fix! Later that night a huge light fixture from the hallway fell and block us in our room not a good experience at all.....no one even apolagized for any of it! Dont stay here~~#~0
Very disappointing. We had dinner in new years eve... plates came out over one hour late, quality substandard relative to pricing. Nice setting. average service, horrible food.~~#~0
Visited Portland's last Tuesday, nice ambiance, very short staffed, the food was so-so, we went to try the parmesan fries which were decent, but sub-par in comparison to Chelsea's Kitchens', and at $7.00 for a side order, a bit pricy.  The dessert, apple strudel/ice cream was comparable to a grocery store bakery, and had absolutely no flavor.~~#~0
It wouldn't let me give no stars.... Worst Customer service, no service updates and misses deadlines for repairs.  DONT GO HERE!!!~~#~0
Got a Jumbo Jack - it tasted like a veggie burger, not 100% beef, tasted like it was full of fillers and only 20% actual beef.  I wonder if certain JITB franchises order their beef from sources that give them beef with fillers to save money.  There is NO WAY pattie was 100% beef.  I could have made a veggie burger at home.Coke was watered down.Going back to Wendy's - they never used pink slime, 100% beef.~~#~0
This is in response to the condescending owner of Genghis Grill.  Unfortunely for you, I'm a bit more educated than your average diner.  I am a registered dietitian and I am smart enough to know the your comments on my initial review are misleading to your other customers.  First off, I have a 30 minute lunch break therefore I dont have time to drive to your restaurant and sit there for 45 minutes.  But I understand many people have 1 hour lunch breaks and they may have time for your restaurant.  This is why I chose YC's because I can get in and out of there on my time schedule.Your goober sauces are more unhealthy than most sauces with the consistancy of water.  The only way sauces get that thick consistency is being made with excessive sugar and/or fat just like BBQ sauce and mayo.  Anyone who knows anything about nutrition and asian dishes should know that "Kung Pao" sauce is one of the most calorically dense sauces.  This goes for any asian restaurant not just YC's- along with other thick sauces like General Tso and Sweet & Sour.  I could really care less about these YC's recipes considering I always make my own as many people do.   I do not want a place that pre-makes the sauces for me.Your comparison is clearly ridiculous considering the portion size you are comparing must be dramatically different.  YC's does not specify a serving size.  Neither do you!  Genghis Grill Serving Size = 0.5 ,1, or 2.  What does this mean????? g? oz? tsp? tbs? cup?  Not exactly what I'd call legitimate.   YC's charges .50 cents for a take-out box not $1.  I was charged 9.99 for lunch on a weekday for a to-go order.  So if your lunch is supposed to cost 8.99 well then you do the math.You only solidified my decision to NEVER GO BACK with your rude response.  I have only ever rated a restaurant with 1 star twice.  I usually rate generously.  My initial review was my honest opinion.  I had nothing against Genhis Grill- it just wasn't for me.  Now that you have responded this way- I will now go to the extent to letting friends and coworkers about the situation.  I'm sure you will stay busy but I will not be visiting again.~~#~0
I called this office based on reviews I read here on yelp. When called I was greeted with "can you hold" I did for 25 minutes. A few times they holding call was picked up with a confused hello? They were obviously unorganized. When I finally reached someone they were very unhelpful, not giving any answers but one word. I was asking questions to clarify while they were trying to say goodbye and hang up. needless to say I will not be giving them money!~~#~0
Plus's  - Free WiFi, no arms on seats.Minus's - Long distance between terminals. Bus service between terminals slow. Have to go thru security again between terminals. Security checkpoints REALLY slow. Three columns for going thru security, regular coach, first class, parents w/children and wheelchairs. What this means is that for regular coach passengers it takes more than a half hour to get thru the damn security screening checkpoint so Good Luck if you're trying to catch a flight in another terminal.  Also, hardly any screens that show flight/gate information. If it's not on your boarding pass or if your boarding pass gate # is wrong, good luck finding what gate you're supposed to be on.~~#~0
I know why they have 5th in their name (the street they are on) but not sure why they even have Wine in their name....the wine list is terrible!  My wife couldn't find one decent wine to have so we ordered one cocktail and left immediately.  Very unusual atmosphere, definitely not a place to watch the pretty people.  I felt like we were at a Steak & Ale.~~#~0
I used to like Lola until I learned the owner is a sexist pig.  I will never visit again!~~#~0
Some friends and I went out for some pool and drinks at spirits. The doorman told us about a $5.00 wristband deal that would allow us to drink $1.00 you call it's until 11 pm. It was about a little before 10:00 pm so we figured it was a pretty decent deal and the 4 of us paid. We each had 1-2 drinks before ordering our next round. At this point it was 10:30 pm and when the waitress brought us our drinks she graciously informed me she would let us buy these drinks for the $1.00 price but that was it. I then informed her that the doorman told us it was until 11 pm and was told, "oh they don't ever tell us anything until last minute, it's 10:30 not 11:00" we got the same awesome customer service from the clueless doorman. Now, 5 bucks isn't going to make or break me but I feel like we got screwed over and it was our problem so we could deal with it, oh well. I think that's just shady business and we left after finishing our drinks. I wasn't about to give them more of my money and I don't ever intend to in the future. If you choose to spend your free time here, make sure you synchronize your watches...~~#~0
My fiancé and I have been loyal Lux customers for sometime now. While out shooting some engagement footage for our upcoming wedding we decided to stop in get some coffee and maybe a clip or two of us in Lux since it has been one our fave date places in the past. Upon sitting down the owner abruptly came over to our table in a very rude fashion and informed us that this was His property. Very sarcastically asked our videographer if he was professional. And basically gave us the boot.  We would have totally been willing to put the camera away if he had been even slightly courteous. There coffee quality pails in comparison to cartel but in the past we thought it was a chill atmosphere. Needless to say we will no longer be fans of Lux. Viva Cartel!~~#~0
I went because I was given a $150 gift certificate. I ordered the steak & lobster combo, steak medium, my wife the salmon. The steak came well done, then it was returned rare - finally it was cooked medium, and the cook personally comped it, which was nice because then the gift cert covered the meal with a decent tip. Get the picture? Also, the lobster was tough. The ambience is ok but crowded, and unless you have a gift certificate or too much money, I can't think of a good reason to burn money here. You can get a comparable steak-lobster combo at a number of other venues at 1/2 to 1/3 the cost.~~#~0
We stayed here only because a wedding we attended took place here. We were part of the wedding party. We reserved two rooms. We were told that since the wedding was at 4, we could have early check-in, to get ready for the wedding.They lied, Other friends and family were told the same thing, and were treated the same way.When we arrived at 11am, we were told that the earliest we could check in was 4pm! I told them that was impossible, because the wedding was at 4, AND THEY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT.The staff at the front desk really did not care. They were rude . They did not even try to solve the problem. Only after begging and pleading for a couple of hours did we finally get a room at 2:30pm. We were told that we could only use the room just to change in. It was the WRONG room and did not fit our family, The " witch-with a b" at the front desk acted as if she was doing us a favor by letting us use it. The front desk never followed up on getting us the correct rooms,. We actually never got the 2nd room, so after the wedding reception, half of our party had to leave and stay elsewhere.Room service food was horrible, cold, burnt, and over priced. The food in the restaurant was awful, too. They also over-charged us for the room that we used. I can't recommend this place to anyone.This is a shame because it is a really nice facility,....but with a really terrible staff. The only person that was nice to us was the bellman.Room Tip: Tip: Stay somewhere else.~~#~0
The food may be good, but I wouldn't know since this place asked me to wait for over two hours to be seated for a table for three.  To be fair, we went in on a Friday night around 7:00 with no reservation.  There were quite a few people waiting for tables and the restaurant was overflowing with people.  I placed my name in with the hostess and was informed it would be a 45-55 minute wait.  Fair enough - seems like a reasonable amount of time to wait on a Friday with no reservations. We wasted time by walking around Scottsdale Quarter and having a juice drink at True Food. We ventured back to Sol and were able to find a spot at the bar.  I had the skinny margarita, which was tasty enough, but nothing special. My guy had the house margarita and he said it was average.  After an hour of waiting, I went to check on our table. The hostess said it would be another 25 minutes for our table to be ready.  We were enjoying the people watching, but growing hungry nonetheless. We decided to wait sice we had already waited this long.  After another 35 minutes, my beau, who is not as rational as I am, went to speak to the hostess and was told it would be yet another half hour. At this point we were looking at a two hour wait with no end in sight. How could we trust them not to ask us to wait another 30 minutes? We left, but not before my cranky guy chewed out the manager. Maybe you could chalk this up to the growing pains of a new restaurant, or the inability of a young staff to properly gauge the wait and manage their tables, but my experience left me thoroughly disappointed and I will not be going back to try the food any time soon.~~#~0
We originally bought our BMW SR1000rr here and thought there were a stand up bunch of guys, but after a terrible experience with our recent 6,000 mile check up all I can say is GO TO SCOTTSDALE. Victory BMW's service department either honestly doesn't have the competence to know what they are doing or are actively trying to rip you off. Our bike went into their shop working beautifully and came out not starting and stalling to point it was un-rideable. Problems dragged on for 2 months before the bike is finally working again.  Things happen. We just wanted them to own to the fact that the mechanic made a mistake and fix the bike. Instead they repeatedly tried to charge us for parts and service that were covered under warranty, showed a complete lack of initiative to resolve a problem that they caused, and ignored the symptoms only to waste time fixing parts that weren't broken.  Sorry to say we would strongly recommend you avoid Victory BMW's service department and watch any bills closely for false charges.~~#~0
Wow.  This could possibly be the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant.  First, they seated us in a back room that had a completely different ambience from the main dining room... this was like a bad addition with high-watt fluourescent spotlights and rickety tables crammed into the corners surrounding a party of ~20.  The worst part, however, was the insanely loud party of Scottsdale douchebags that were having some sort of party in the room.  The staff acted like they didn't even notice and made no attempt to quiet them... I'm talking slamming on tables, screaming across the room at one another, and just general douchebaggery.  The food was mediocre... the appetizers were cold and my pork chop was certainly nothing special.  Do yourself a favor and spend your money somewhere else.~~#~0
Hello? GeekSquad?I purchased a GeekSquad install of a wireless router and was told the next available opening was a week away. No problem. Sunday, between 12 and 4 they said. I called about 10am to confirm. No problem they said, we'll see you between 12 and 4. No one came. And when I called the store at 4 to find out why, there was no answer on any of their lines. Thanks GeekSquad for nothing more than a $149.00 bill and NO SERVICE!~~#~0
Three words: bland, expensive, bland. I went with a friend and she ordered a ham sandwich and I ordered crab cakes. We were both disappointed and found this place way OVERRATED. I think you pay for the atmosphere because the food is just your average lunch.~~#~0
Anyone that calls what they serve here chilaquiles has never had a decent plate of chilaquiles in their life.  I was really disappointed to say the least when I was served a plate of soaked tortilla chips in a pasty, canned-tomato sauce... My husband said his huevos rancheros were ok, but then again he'll eat anything.  The place was getting pretty full for lunch, so maybe other menu items were better Phoenix, AZ 85008than the sad and pathetic dish that I got.~~#~0
We recently attended a wedding here and had a very bad experience with the owner. I suppose the place is probably fine as long as you don't plan on having children, especially those with special needs, at your wedding. If you're planning on inviting your entire family, and not just adults, then you're better off finding some place more tolerant.~~#~0
I can't give this place 0 stars?  Too bad.We've been here a couple times and have liked the food however my most recent trip led me to 5 days (and counting) of the worst bacterial gastroenteritis, two trips to urgent care and countless hours of misery.  Will be making a complaint to Environmental Health.For you health - do not go.And the service sucks.~~#~0
I was visiting Phoenix and found Tod's card.  I called him because he said he would do a  2 for price of 1 massage $140.  I asked that the massage room be warm.  I arrived for the appointment and the room was very cold.  The massage was ok.  I booked the 2nd massage.  1.5 hours before the 2nd massage he cancelled with me.  He said he would refund me on my credit card but he has not credited me yet.  My experience with Tod is he says he will do something and does not do it.I was frustrated and unimpressed.~~#~0
This facility is over rated and not reliable. I asked on a few occasions for requests and the service would brush me off. Granted I'm not in the industry where I wear a white collard shirt everyday, but I deserve to be listen to and taken seriously. It is like a large rock rolling down a hill and no one cares to warn the village. It's damned due to it's size!~~#~0
oh hell to the naw...I went to this place for the first time because hubby said he saw it on tv the day before and let me tell you, the service or lack was sooooo bad.  We waited about 45 minutes for our food, 45 FREAKIN MINUTES!!!!!!!! and the only reason my hubby didnt complain was because sports center was on.  Now let me get to the food the fried rice is ok and the the red jade chicken was fine also, but nothing I would drive 20 minutes to get to ever again in my life.  But I will give them one star because my better half liked his food a little better than I did.  Oh and let me not forget those free cookies which we got about 8 of probably because they had us waiting so long.  And that would have been all good if they didnt crumble and taste like sand paper in your mouth except for the huge chunks of chocolate chips that my hubby pointed out.~~#~0
Had a bad experience... Found a chicken bone in my burrito, food took 45 minutes to come out, never saw our server, and it wasn't busy at all. There was no excuse for the terrible service and wait times, let alone the bone that I almost broke a tooth on. The atmosphere is kind of cool, but they could care less about you and it shows. We finally asked to speak with the manager (I have never done that before in my life), and she quasi apologized and informed us that she would discount our bill- When the bill arrived she deducted a whopping $4! That was less than the burrito cost with the chicken bone. This place must be kind of good because of all the positive reviews, but I would NEVER recommend going to this place.~~#~0
I was going to stay here tonight as my apartment was going to be fumigated and it's right around the corner from where I live.I asked the girl at the front desk what the price of a room was for a night. She gave me a stern look and said the price and put a LOT of emphasis on ONE PERSON. I said, yes, just me. Then she looked at me again and said all of our rooms are NO SMOKING. Again with the emphasis. Which was fine with me as I don't smoke anyway and did in fact notice the sign on the door that said it was.So I gave her my ID and said that I would like a room for the night.When she gave me the total I pulled out $60 and handed it to her. She didn't take it and told me that if I was paying cash that it was $100 for a deposit.I was confused as to what she was saying and I was trying to verify that it was refundable and that I would get the other $40 back at checkout.She informed me that it was $100 on top of the $60 for the room and that they would check the room before I could leave before refunding the deposit if there was NO DAMAGE. (Again with that vastly irritating emphasis).Listen. I know the address on my license told you that I reside just around the corner. That doesn't mean that I was getting a prostitute and planned on smoking in your non-smoking establishment. It doesn't mean that I plan on throwing the TV off the balcony. I know that you are right in the middle of the Mesa hood, but not everyone in the hood is a hoodlum. I just needed a place to stay while my apartment is fumigated.Went to Best Western instead. No problems. Little more expensive, but for the hassle this lady was giving me and undoubtedly would give me tomorrow in regards to my deposit....I think I still won out on the bottom line there...~~#~0
Nasty beef lo main #nasty egg rolls taste like theres curry and something else....oh no meat when we came~~#~0
The wife and I used to frequent the SanTan location often, when we lived in Mesa. We always had great service, and the place was always clean.However, after moving to to the N. Phx area we tried this location, as it was the nearest.We were in for a shock, it was a completely different experience.We were seated fairly quick, and immediately noticed that the BBQ sauce assortment looked as it had not been cleaned in years. Every one of the containers had crusty discolored sauce caked on the tips. It was disgusting, but since we don't eat the sauces we were willing to overlook that.The table was not clean, it had obviously gotten the two second wipe down. This is unacceptable at a BBQ place where most food is messy.So, the food. I can't comment on this as we were never served, or even waited on.We sat in our booth for a solid 10-15 minutes watching several of the wait staff walk by us, look at us, and do nothing.The most annoying part were the seaters. They had 3-4 seaters huddled around the little podium, and one (the tall/larger one) kept looking at us. It was obvious she knew what was going on. Other tables around us even noticed we had not been waited on. None of the seaters bothered to do anything. There was no manager in sight either.We got up, and proceeded to the door, when the taller seater woman blurts out "Leaving Already?"I turned and said "We have been waiting for 15 minutes, and have not even seen a waitress." She kinda gave a "whatever" look and said "Have a great day!"So, after frequenting the SanTan location and receiving nothing but great service and a clean place to eat, we are NOT going back to the Peoria location. We drove ~10 miles to get there, and had to take our money elsewhere because they couldn't be bothered to serve us. We frequent places we like, and get good service. We eat out nearly every night as we both have busy careers and don't like to cook. Famous Daves Peoria lost out on "regular" customers, and we will not recommend them to any of our co-workers, or friends.~~#~0
Worst service and mediocre food. After being seated, we waited over an hour and waitress never came back to take our order. We had to ask another waitress to serve us and might I add that this place was empty for a Saturday night. I will NEVER come back! Also, the food taste like it was warmed up in the microwave. Avoid Gallagher's at all costs!!~~#~0
Talk about bad customer service. Husband and wife team - the wife is a total sour puss and seemingly hates you for walking in the place. No smile, no greeting, she has one purpose - to take your money. Pointless signs are everywhere such as the one notifying you of a charge for the second refill of your drink (really what percentage of people actually have a second refill??), and don't dare move the chili peppers from the condiment area or you will be shot!! Pizza is good especially if you are hungry - could be better if they had a wood oven.~~#~0
worst return policy in the world!even with a receipt! be careful if you do a partial payment with a gift card!!Experience 1 - I purchased Nip/Tuck season whatever ($40), a sweater ($28) and the Black Eyed Peas cd ($12) online from target.com. I paid mostly with my debit card, but I had used the last $9 of a gift card as well.I printed the order confirmation everything showed exactly as I ordered it. I get my items and instead of the Black Eyed Peas Cd I get the Nip Tuck soundtrack. I go to return it to the store. I can'y because althought they carry the cd, that portion of the order was fulfilled by amazon.com NOT target.com. So I bought the cd there in store and called target to find out about returning it for a refund and a credit on the shipping. They would only refund the cd to the gift card and no refund on shipping since the nip tuck soundtrack was on the invoice, it must be my mistake even though my order confirmation shows no signs of the nip tuck sndtrk. When I read them their own return policy stating simply that refunds will be credited to the original form of payment and since the cd was priced higher than the value of the gift card the refund should be credited to my debit card. The representative then lead me to a SECOND return policy that was similar but stated that the entire amount would be refunded to the gift card since i used a target gift card for a portion of the payment. Now to get to this second refund, I had to type the URL into the address bar of my browser. The rep was unable to tell me how to navigate to it from their site. There were no links to get to it. It was a static page that required you to type the address in manually. How would I have ever known that??Experience2 - I purchased some nice metal shower curtain hooks ($16). They kept catching on the shower rod tho as the rod was too thick around. I went to return them. I had no receipt and I paid cash. My fault.  I went to exchange it for a $65 mirror which I was told I cannot do since I didn't have the receipt I could only exchange it for something of equal or greater value (the mirror was greater) and from the same department. IT WAS FROM THE SAME STORE WHO THE FUCK CARES WHAT DEPARTMENT IT WAS FROM??Oh and I couldn't get store credit I had to use it that same day.~~#~0
Painfullyyyyy sloooowwww. Very hard to describe, but with no wait, took 30 minutes for an omelet because they lost our ticket twice. Incompetent. I really love the Paradise chain... it just seems the manager here hasn't a clue about a customers time...~~#~0
If there was a way to give negative stars, I would. This place has been a constant disappointment in every way. They keep charging me the fees and the "manager" only comes in once a week and doesn't return phone calls. Worst customer service of any local business I have experienced. My saga started over a year ago when I went in for the first massage, it was great. When your feeling relaxed and happy, then they hook you into a year long contract and that's where it gets messy. All of a sudden the therapist you started with no longer works there. Come to find out the amount of turnover here is out of control and you can rarely get the same person twice. They are mostly straight out of massage school and have no experience. The ones that are any good leave for better places like Elements. If you try to cancel, no such luck! Wait it out. I waited, thought I cancelled but apparently it was just a freeze for 6 months. Time goes by and I notice a charge on my card again, yey!  No phone call from them to say hey we are charging again, no email, nothing. Go to find the place, and they moved. Now its officially cancelled, but I have to wait 30 days and another billing cycle to make that happen. So thats one more charge for a membership I have no interest in ever using. DONT SIGN A CONTACT HERE.~~#~0
Went to OHSO on a Sunday afternoon for some Beers and Grub. Being that I mostly find myself hanging out in Downtown Scottsdale and Arcadia I had felt bad by not showing them some love. Wish I could say the love was returned. For only being open as short of a time as they have been what a dirty place. I sat and watched at least five of the beer taps constantly drip which in turn created rust spots dripping down the same cabinets that were just painted over from German Corner. The food was a two. Brisket sandwich was a gut busting stomach rock and if you are going to try to do breakfast/brunch it really shouldn't be that difficult . As we were leaving we ran into some local food industry people we knew and found out about a back patio which you really wouldn't know was there if it wasn't pointed out. Was hoping for a mind-blowing patio to save our overall experience but ended up being a bar made of 2x4's with a bunch of fruit flies and a not so great view of the Scottsdale drainage canal. Woohoo.~~#~0
I haven't gotten confirmation on this, but a bartender that was waiting on me last night, told me that The Great Escape have shut their doors.  Shit.~~#~0
Salt, salt salt then add a lot of oil.  This usually means your fast food place will be a success but these guys stepped it up about three notches of salt and oil over mcdonalds which I thought was impossible to pull off.  I couldn't stop laughing and feeling bad for the old man across from us because when he got his meal he grabbed the salt shaker and poured it on before tasting the salt lick they serve.I ordered the BBQ burger, sweet potatoe fries, and onion strings. All of these would of been good, but I couldn't taste anything but pounds of salt.  It got even more comical when I tried to gulp down some soda,and the dr. Pepper was as flat as a tire.  Dumped it out and got some coke, and same thing. Usually reviewers hit the nail on the head at yelp but this places reviews I don't get at all.~~#~0
It was bound to happen sooner or later, my first 1 star review.  I have, up till this point, not needed to write a 1 start review.  Usually a place has 1 or 2 redeeming qualities.  This event did not.My wife bought the groupon online, so the two of us got in for only $10, instead of $20.  The first thing we noticed as we went in, was everyone walking out complaining.  I didn't really see a single person leave (and they were going by the truck fulls) that wasn't complaining about something.  Just getting in was a hassle for some people.  The ticket takers didn't really know what was going on so had some people standing in some lines twice and going back and forth.  It was pretty much chaosOnce we got in we decided to take a walk around a little and see what there was to offer.  There was a decent selection of trucks parked on the outside of the event but the lines were HUUUUUGE.  In all honesty, the average line to get to a car was probably somewhere along the lines of 120-150 people.  We walked around trying to find a truck that didn't have such an enormous wait.  There weren't any.  We were just going to leave without trying anything, but figured we had to atleast try the food, it must have been amazing, right?  Wrong. We got in a line to get some little sliders.  While waiting in the line I jumped out to the ice cream stand next to us.  We had some "homemade" ice cream that had decent flavor but giant ice crystals which made the texture very of putting.  We finished the ice cream and still had about 15 minutes left to wait before we could even order the food.What we ended up getting was a little slider burger, a little pulled pork sandwich, some fries with both of those and a bacon fritter.  My burger was decent.  Nothing great.  My younger brother (who is COMPLETELY not into food) makes a better burger and he doesn't really do much to it.   The burger wasn't even "not hot", it was room temp at best.  My wife's pulled pork sandwich was good, not great, but good.  The fries that came with both of them were a great idea that was poorly executed.  They were like a cross between a french fry and a chip.  I really wanna make some at home.  The fritter was good, but flavor profile wise, it tasted like a McDonald's  McGriddle.  So not that great.  For all of this we ended spending like 16ish bucks.  So WAY more than it was worth (considering we had another 10 on top of that just to get in)From start to finish (starting standing in line to done eating) was about 45 minutes.  That is just for two tinny little sandwiches.  That is by far the worst thing about this.  The beer lines were enormous, the food lines were enormous, the even lines were enormous and to do any 1 thing would easily take 30 minutes. To me, the worst thing about all this is the fact that people that went last time said the EXACT SAME THING.  The lines were way to long and no one could really enjoy the different trucks.  They knew this going into it and did nothing to fix it.  I WILL NOT be going to the next "festival" they do here.~~#~0
Upon first arrival the place was nice.  I liked the decor and it seemed like a great place to dine with some friends.  My first (and only) visit was on my birthday, and the service was less than desirable.  My duck was served extremely rare - to rare to be crispy as described, and my friends were not all that impressed with their food either.  Napa-Italian... there was nothing that remined me of the wonderful Napa valley here.  The cocktails were very weak, so we quickly switched to wine, which was nice.  I had a slight cough, and we were told - as we were handed the bill after our main course - that it was beginning to make the other patrons wonder if it was there food and they wanted us to leave.  No joke!  Asked to leave the restaurant on my birthday, without even getting dessert, over a cough!  Unfortunately service like that has lost my future business.~~#~0
A cup of Ice for $3! Are you Kiddin' me?Three tacos for $5 is a good deal!A can of Soda for $1 not a bad deal...But when you order the lemonade for $3, it's 95% crushed ice & comes with a cute little umbrella in the straw, well this part is a "rip off!""Seriously! "I usually order differnt Tacos & they are good! All the ingredients are fresh...The  fish, carne asada and chicken are my favorites.  The green and red salsas are tasty. Also freshly madeIf I didn't feel so ripped off on the lemonade, & I've made this mistake several times, I would give this place Five Stars!~~#~0
OMG, this place is horrible. So, for many years I've enjoyed Paradise Bakery on multiple Phoenix/Scottsdale trips. I noticed this location and had about 1 hour to kill in between 2 meetings.First problem: Cash register is a single point of failure. There's probably 220 feet of counter space with one cash register. Really bad design!!! Of course, I go when the "not so bright" girl is working and the elderly man and woman change their mind and re-order the single coffee and single tea 3 different times. There's no one else working and I really need something to drink.I'm gasping and exasperated, and at this point spot a tray of large paper cups. Though, I'm tempted to just steal a drink and leave money on the table, I remember this is Phoenix and they shoot Californians for this. So, I take my paper cup and fill it with ice water and go start using the "Free wifi".  After a bit, I assume the elderly couple has moved on, so I go back to order. Now she has a line because she's show and the patrons aren't helping. I go back to my laptop and get a message that my 30 minutes of free wifi is done. At this point, I'm both pissed and hungry, so I left.This place should have their franchise licensed pulled as they give Paradise a horrible name. They left such a negative impression that I didn't visit the Scottsdale Paradise, nor will I.~~#~0
I decided to branch out and try a new Korean place.  I wanted to see how good/bad my usual place (Cho Dang) was.  I wasn't surprised to find out that Cho Dang is in a league of its own when it comes to Korean BBQ in CHandler.  Takamatsu was as underwhelming as it gets.The decor is like a cafeteria.  Patrons are very loud.  It seems that everyone goes there for the all you can eat sushi.  The person who sat us thought we were there for it and our server did a triple take when we didn't have anything filled out on the sushi form.  Call me a sushi snob all you want, but I don't go to a Korean place to get my fix, and if I did, I wouldn't go to an all you can eat place.  I'm not trying to maximize calories, I am trying to maximize flavor.We ordered two dishes we routinely get at Cho Dang, Bulgogi and another dish. we had some miso soup that was included which was good.  That is literally impossible to screw up because it comes from either a powder or a cube.  No points for not screwing that up.  Out came the sides and the dishes.  This is when it got very disappointing.  The sides were inedible.  Most were very bland while others were just bad.  I don't think any side was edible.  The bulgogi was decent, but still not as good as I'm used to.  The other dish was poorly executed and just tasted bad.  Overall, the place was really bad.  They deserve 1 star but if I could I would be generous and give them a 1.5 stars because we ate the bulgogi and didn't leave completely unsatisfied.  I'll never go back considering there is Korean food that is in a different league just down the street on Ray and Arizona.  This place looked like a chinese buffet, and the food execution was on the same level.  I didn't see a single Korean there eating which is a bad sign.  I saw a ton of wannabe sushi eaters, a few SE-Asians and several old people. I gave it a shot once and won't be back.  Worst Korean food I've ever eaten without question.  Yelp reviewers are really starting to get a bad rap with me.  If this is the best Korean BBQ you have had, what places could possibly be worse?~~#~0
We were greeted in a friendly manner and promptly seated. Water and menus immediately---went downhill in a hurry.  Waited twenty minutes for the appetizers---my husband's arrived, but mine did not. Waited more-- complained-- was offered a glass of wine. I don't want to be placated with alcohol and excuses about the kitchen. I would like service. My appetizer finally  arrived. Waited another twenty minutes for dinner-- same thing. His arrived; mine wasn't served for another ten minutes. Cold and mediocre. THEN we were charged for a bottle of wine when  the only beverage ordered was one glass of wine.Who needs this with so many good Chinese restaurants in Scottsdale??????Never again!~~#~0
ONE WORD: Gross. My cousin and I compared the texture of the ground beef kabob to that of her dog's food. The filet kabob, while the taste was ok, had a very strange texture - almost like it was steamed or something. I definitely agree that they are VERY skimpy on the meat, which I guess doesn't matter 'cause it sucked. The hummus was just blah - I could make my own better. Their only saving grace was their basmati rice, which wasn't even all that great either.~~#~0
I am not writing this review to be mean, but I truly disliked this place. The place needs a facelift, it's struggling in comparison to any of the other places in close proximity- and yes I understand it's much cheaper. I tried it on a Tuesday when they even had a special, so it was cheaper than usual even. The decor is a little bit of a timewarp, and it wasn't very clean- there was 1 person in the place; usually a major red flag but hey 2 tacos for like 5.99 what the heck? Then I realized it was 7pm, so I almost walked off. I was drawn to a sign that was implying there food was somewhat healthy. Wrong. Now for the bad part- the food. Really sad and bland, reheated food. Those tacos were bad, and I'm not very picky. The beans might have been the most pathetic thing I've ever tasted, and were a little burnt from sitting in that pan all day. How do you mess up beans if you're a Mexican restaurant? I guess the 1 star should go to the nice employee who nobly served me the jail food. He had a very defeated look, as if to plead with me to RUN. He was nice though- he would be wise to apply at one of the many stellar places right in tacos del mar backyard. If I was the owner of this establishment I would probably renovate and reinvent the joint quite a bit, the rent can't be cheap in this area and there is quite the competition.~~#~0
I love the food at Fatburger, I just don't love this particular location. They always close ridiculously early and the times on the website are different than the ones here listed on Yelp: "Operating Hours: Sun-Thu: 11am-8pm | Fri-Sat: 11am-10pm". I've been in this location at 7:30pm and seen customers turned away around 7:45pm being told that they were already closed.I recently went there on a Friday night at 9:30pm and almost all of the chairs in the restaurant had already been put on top of tables and employees were already walking out. My party and I ordered food and found a place to sit and I was enjoying my meal... until I found a long dark hair wrapped around one of my fries. I asked for a refund on my fries and was given one, yet without any apology. Even though this location is closest to me, I only was able to visit a few times since they always closed too early and now I will never go back that I've found hair in my food. Find a cleaner Fatburger where employees care about quality and aren't rushing to get out of there.~~#~0
My family insists on going to this Chipotle because they like the food.  I go next door to AJ's and buy my food because I would never eat in a place this FILTHY!  Every time I go, same thing.  I complained to management and they don't seem to care.  Doesn't matter what time we go - busy or not, tables are never cleaned, floor has food all over it.  And the bathroom?  Ugh - I won't even go there.  The health dept really needs to pay this place a visit!~~#~0
I am so disappointed with this office. I purchased a certificate online for a stone massage. Sounds great, huh? Yeah, I thought so too. Problem is that the advertising on the website offering the certificate didn't state that you had to get the massage on specific days at specific times - all of which are during the standard working hours (M-F, before 5p). I work full time at a doctor's office and have to have appointments in evening for a massage - or a weekend. Which, by the way, they indicated on the website that you had to call for Saturday hours. That's why I purchased the massage - for a Saturday visit. When I called to schedule - AFTER the purchase is made - I'm told they don't have Saturday hours and the last appointment during the week is at 5pm. I don't get off work till 5pm. Okay, I'll give them some credit (that's why there's ONE star) - they made an exception and allowed me to schedule for 5:30pm. Well, the long and short of it is that the day I'm supposed to go for the massage, I forgot my phone at home. When I called from work to confirm, I was told that because I didn't return their call earlier (which I didn't know they'd even made), my appointment was canceled. CANCELED! I'm so upset!! But now I figure, if they are that uncaring about my appointment time, then how caring will they be with me?? I'm very, very disappointed and although they said they will refund my money, I'm still upset with how the overall experience has turned out. I will not attempt to use their service again nor will I recommend them to anyone.=(~~#~0
3/29/10Came here after work as Mom needed to do some light shopping at Mekong supermarket.  Since it was already 815p, she started grocery-shopping, while I placed an order for spring rolls, which Mom specially-requested, and a combination pho.  I've always wondered if the meatball dish was any good, so I ordered that, too.  In less than 10 minutes, our dishes were ready, so I texted Mom to come on over.Mom didn't really enjoy the fresh rolls- she only had half of one, and the other sat in the fridge for three days until I tossed it out.  We also didn't enjoy the meatball platter.  What a waste!  Terrible presentation (unflattering color- could've used some searing action to give the slices a nice crust), horrid texture (clammy/rubbery), and very bland in flavor.  Two bites, and I wondered who would ever order this again?  Not us!  Thankfully, the pho saved the evening!  That is, until it became quite clear, from the heightened energy levels of the cleaning crew, that they were anxious to close for the evening.  We were trying to eat as fast as we could, until I finally looked at my watch and noted it was only 8:45p!  What the...?  Then I remembered that the last time we were there, we were treated the same way, too, but it was understandable, since it was closer to 9p then.Sorry, Com Tam, but lackluster spring rolls, ghastly meatball dish, and rushing us when there was still plenty of time are two reasons too many not to come back!~~#~0
The high school portion is VERY different and ran differently than the grade school. I ended up pulling my kids out of there. High teacher turn-over, the inability of the school to cope with any special needs. bad.  Years ago the administration was good; but not its just.. bad (in my openion).~~#~0
I typically agree with Yelp ratings, so the cognitive dissonance I've experienced twice now going to Cibo is really strange for me. I have to chalk it up to going both times during lunch, when they don't serve pizza, because people seem to be crazy for the pizza here, but everything I've had at this place just plain sucks. From a mushy "meatball" sandwich that played more like an Italian sloppy joe to the criminally dry, flavorless salad topped stingily with tiny, cold chunks of bland chicken. I don't have any good words for any of the entrees I have tried here and nothing my companions ordered looked especially appealing either.Oh cool! They start you out with some bread on a cutting board. Ask them for butter though, and you'll be informed that they don't have any. No butter! A restaurant that is devoid of butter. Let me talk about this for a second. First of all, I don't believe it, so just right there, I think you're lying to me. Saying "our policy is to not give our customers butter when they ask for it" doesn't sound so good though, so I understand. The service was otherwise acceptable, if not terribly friendly.If you ask me, and I know I'm only one small voice amid a chorus of four and five star reviews, this place is long on atmosphere and location and short on everything else. Expensive prices for the stingy portions of mediocre food. I don't even know if I'll go back for the pizza.~~#~0
This is for the Event Planning services department only: TERRIBLE.  My fiance and I were due to get married here in October of this year and we had to cancel in March because LeAnn wouldn't return emails or phone calls.  So we had to start back at square 1 in March - it was very hard to find another location to have our ceremony and reception, so we had to split the locations.  Now i have to deal with finding rentals for chairs and tables, worry about space for musicians and my photobooth, and parking - thanks Palm Valley Event Planning!~~#~0
Just don't go here, period.  A filling I received while in the military needed to be replaced after it cracked and came out.  Long story short I went to Weldon Dental and had it redone.  Low and behold I needed many other things done.  Almost 2,000 dollars later I still cannot eat without severe pain that was non-existent before.  my fillings were drilled to deep and never ground correctly, even after 10+ visits.  Two of the teeth I had work done on still have sharp edges that are aggravating as hell.  Also before even finishing all the work I payed for, Dr Jafari thought it would be a good idea to sell his practice to a husband and wife team of dummies (without notifying me mind you) who refused to repair/finish/honor any work he had done without charging me again.  The next to last straw was the new dentist trying to convince me that I needed YET ANOTHER 2,000 dollars worth of work done.  When I said no I can't afford it because I'm a disabled vet and don't have that kinda money she tried to pull a fast one and send her pretty little secretary in to talk me into it and sign a contract.  Then when she realized I wasn't gonna fall for that, the dentist came back in and snapped at me "YOU KNOW YOU NEED THIS WORK DONE!!!" and told me to leave and come back in a couple weeks.  I have no clue why I made another appointment but, when I got a call at 9:30pm the night before to tell me that the doctor wasn't going to be able to see me the next day because she had forgotten about some tennis match she was supposed to play in, that was the last straw.  I wish I could sue the hell out of this place for my money back and the cost of having my teeth PROFESSIONALLY fixed!!!~~#~0
Thankfully they're still closed. That's it.That's my update.Drink Folgers. Drink Sanka. Drink malted battery acid. Just know you're lucky you didn't drink the "coffee" here!~~#~0
Went mid afternoon order a pulled pork sandwich, rack of ribs... wouldn't consider this place authentic by any means... I've had better frozen meals in my time. Also so called "handmade" root beer wasn't as good as I expected. Pulled pork sandwich bun was stale, and actual meat on sandwich was dry. Not worth the 20 or so bucks I wasted.~~#~0
These guys have been horrible. I wanted a ring from knight rider they suggested we go to the other store.. (didn't bother offering to get it in) so we decided on another ring. i will not name names, but "she" had to order it from germany. she never touched base with me, i had to call and email several times before she ever got back to me with updates. finally, i get the ring 2 months later and it's the wrong ring. they discontinued the one she ordered and sent her a one that was like it. really? no one told you it was this had been discontinued SIX months ago? so then i make a deal for the knight rider ring that i went in to purchase orginally... again, the contact and coorespondence is horrible. i sent over my CC information to purchase the ring 4 days ago, still haven't heard back. i'm SO frustrated. i will never use these guys again. I DO appreciate the fact that "she" tried to make up for the debacle by getting me a great price on the knight rider ring.. but to be honest, this was supposed to be an anniversary present for 2 months ago. my spouse has no idea what's going on with her ring.. it's just been horrible. i asked around and got really bad reviews from random people. i guess i should have asked around before i went to shop there.~~#~0
The surroundings are lovely, as other reviewers have mentioned, but the staff is aloof at best, the patrons are into pointing out that X across the room is wearing LAST YEAR'S Prada, while sipping huge over priced martinis. The patrons can range the gamut from the blue haired crowd at 5 to clueless tourists, yuppies, and then later at night turns mostly gay. It is a place to see and be seen. All superficial with no substance. The place is horribly noisy with hard surfaces everywhere, you cant hear people or make yourself heard without shouting, the food is mediocre (but dependably so) and much of the furniture is weirdly uncomfortable. Am I on a rant? Ok... I admit it-- I hate this place. And many people will totally love it for the same reasons as listed above. :) If you love pretension and overpriced food and drinks, THIS is totally your place.~~#~0
Food was okay, nothing too special.   Service was awful.  Drink refills were non existent, finally hot refil after the meal was completed.   Asked for roll refil which never came.   Never received at condiments that were requested (one person had a burger and wanted mustard).Staff all was not overly friendly to the point the impression is nobody wanted to be there.Waitress nor the manager ever came by to ask how everything was.Would not recommend this location~~#~0
I bought a Kitchen Aid Mixer on December 6th at the Kitchen Collection Store at the Outlet Mall in Carlsbad, CA.  It was given to my son and his wife for Christmas.  When they got it out of the (NEW) box to use it, as the beaters turned, it made grinding noises.  I called the KC in Carlsbad and explained what happened and that my son lives in Phoenix.  They said to take it in with the receipt to any of the Arizona KC stores.  My son and his wife and baby took a 40 mile trip to go to the Kitchen Collection store at Anthem.  The experience they had was way less than pleasant. After lugging the Mixer in and presenting it (in the box with everything it came with) and the receipt to the person workiing at their register, my son was told that they don't take returns or exchanges on the kitchen aid items.  My son told her what I had been told and also showed her on the bottom of the receipt that stated they DO accept returns and exchanges and she told him it was Company Policy not to do so on Kitchen Aid appliances.  He asked if she had that policy in writing and she said "NO, it is an understood policy and is not in writing." After trying to talk with her and ask to speak with someone else, she was still rude.  They were not nice and not helpful and did not follow the policy stated on their receipt.  My son left with his Kitchen Aid Mixer, went home, called Kitchen Aid's 800 number and they are sending him a new one.  Sad experience and  the money I would have saved with a rebate, was spent on gas.~~#~0
I ordered the phad thai medium with beef, and didn't like it. The "phad thai" is actually a tomato based noodle dish, and smelled like ketchup. Even though it didn't say anything about a tomato base on the menu! They switched it for me to "traditional phad thai," made with tamarind sauce, but it was really lacking the taste I associate with thai places I like. Bland. It didn't have much of a peanuty or fishy taste.Might try their curry if I go back, since it seems like people like that.Loud Music was, I assume, from Thailand. It was over the top poppy, and very loud. They even left it on for a long track that sounded like someone interviewing the band in thai. I'm all for authenticity, but the food was bland and the atmosphere was bizarre~~#~0
sriracha and Tabasco are your only hopes at hippies--Bland, greasy and undercooked potato dice--coffee quality (like everything else here) is piss-poor--pancakes from a box, agave syrup doesn't do much--plastic plates and utensils ruin whatever's left, like a fly-infested bowl of potato mush at the neighborhood pot luck, now scooped to mouth with a flimsy twist of soft sporkage. --regular commercial radio accompanies...with commercialsMISS IT~~#~0
I had my transmission replaced here and 2 months later it went out again because they installed it improperly. They tried to then make me pay for labor to replace it! After I threatened with a law suit they said they would cover their work, but It has been three weeks since then. ABYSMAL COMPANY! WATCH OUT! Did I mention that they haven't even started working on it in that 3 weeks?~~#~0
Arrived at 11:30 on a Wednesday and ordered promptly.  It took 30 minutes for a salad and a french dip (and they weren't very busy).  The fries were cold.  The sandwich was cool.  The au jus was hot enough to burn my lip, thereby rendering the whole thing inedible until it cooled.  The ranch was so runny it was like water.  And, to top it off, got a touch of food poisoning.  Won't ever go back!~~#~0
Dear person who decided that we would have our "after party" at Chez Nous,It is with the most utmost regret that inform you that you're choice of after party venues was teh suck. And no, I did not misspell "the". That's how we say it these days. Get with the times, sucka.But seriously, wtf?Through what twisted logic did you come to the conclusion that the best way to top off a birthday party at fez laden with free appetizers, cake, and drink specials was an over-priced, overcrowded jazz bar...on a Saturday night?Now before I go any further, I shall confess to you that I was spared the $7 dollar charge. My friend and I managed to talk the doorman down to $4 for the two of us. Perhaps he was desperate to get more ladies into the establishment. Perhaps he's just a chump.In either case, you'll be interested to know that while waiting in the parking lot for my friend's boyfriend to show up, I witnessed the doorman using your $7 to help pay for a pizza and hot sandwich from Dominos. Unlike some of the other ladies in our party, I will not complain about the ass-grabbing and creepy smiles I received. Because I didn't receive any. No, menacing glares and bathroom gossip was my lot. Feeling that my safety was in jeopardy, I was compelled to make a hasty exit in the middle of the chorus of "Ladies Night". I'm not going to fault you for inviting me to a totally UN-safe space (because maybe I should've done some research before I took you up on it), but if you were a vegan I wouldn't invite you to a place that I knew had no vegan-friendly options. I'm going to leave it at that.And I'm not going to expect you to ask all of us our age, but please be aware that there are a great number of us who were NOT products of the 70's and have little use for disco and gold chains. The average patron had to be at least 10 years older and 20 years more behind on fashion than even you'd ever tolerate in a date. I take solace in the knowledge that you were just as unlucky as I would be (if I was single and into cougars, that is).I know that the overall cost of Chez Nous might seem a little exaggerated, considering we just had free appetizers and cake at FEZ, but nothing ruins a birthday party afterglow like inane ATM fees and greedy, smooth-talking doormen.Regardless, I want you to know that despite my displeasure with your recent choice of after-party locales, I still love you. In fact, I'm grateful to you, in my own way. It's so hard to be funny and snarky when you're writing a 4-5 star review of a place. In a time where my ability to nitpick and rant, it's refreshing to finally find a place so terrible I am justified in my neurosis. In the event that all of this is too wordy and convoluted to understand, I've made you a chart. =Things That Are Awesome=YelpMartinisZombie moviesLesbians=Things That Are Not Awesome=Overcrowded bars with unreasonable cover chargeSee you at the next UYE, you jive motherfucker!Hugs and kisses,JettaP.S. Nathan, I still have your coat. Let's make arrangements to get it back to you. The longer I have it the longer I'm going to be tempted to use it the next time Misty S and I have "roleplay night". Which I might do anyway if I find out all this was your idea : - )~~#~0
I had never been to Sweet Tomatoes until today. I have been to Souper Salad many times before and I expected it to be similar but better.Well, I will start with the good.Okay and now the so-so. I had the chocolate bread muffin. It was tasty, and chocolaty, but dark chocolaty. Not sweet at all really. Like I said, it was good but as it was not sweet, it was not dessert, and as it was chocolate it didn't really go with anything else.I moved on to try the chocolate bread pudding concoction they had. That was REALLY good, but it was almost gone so I only got the edges. I got hardly any of the gooey chocolaty messiness that I truly wanted. This dessert probably would have been in the good category if I had gotten some 5-20 minutes earlier.And now for the bad. I'll just start from beginning to end. Raw beets = not good! Dry, stale spit most of my first bite out. The light ranch tasted like it was on the verge of going bad. The regular ranch was watered down. They were out of Coke, Dr. Pepper and Rootbeer and only had ice at the cashiers station, not in the soda fountain. The Chinese orange happy chicken salad had no chicken and I was not happy! I moved onto the soups. First I tried the 3-cheese tortellini soup. I couldn't taste any cheese and the tortellini was mush.The broth was flavorful but I still only had 3 bites. I moved on to the Irish Potato and Leek soup. It was pretty tasty actually but I still had to doctor it up with salt pepper and cream cheese because it was otherwise rather bland. I also took a bite of the chicken noodle soup. It had big chunks of chicken in it. Big, dry, overcooked pieces of chicken. It was also bland. Should have had some veggies in it. The mac n "cheese" was soupy and also bland.You won't catch me back here anytime soon!~~#~0
We had a cheese and mushroom pizza. We order salads before the pizza and they showed up at our table 5 minutes after the pizza. I like a cheeze pizza where toppings cover the whole piece. The cheese covered only about half or 2/3 thirds of each piece and they were chintzy on the mushrooms The pizza is simply overprice. The manager apologize for the service and gave us an employee discount. I would not go back again unless someone picked up the tab.~~#~0
I had a plumber from Scottsdale plumbing come out to check some work that another plumber had messed up.  He said that he thought sewage gas was leaking into the home and that we should contact the other plumber to fix it and that when we did he would come back and check the other plumber's work and include that return visit on the same invoice at no additional charge.  He was in the house for a total of five minutes which is why he said he would come back and include the return visit as part of the same invoice.Apparently the company expected to be paid in full before the plumber returned to our home.  And so a representative called me and said that I needed to pay the full invoice before the plumber returned to the home.  I said that I thought it was reasonable that we would pay after the plumber came back and visited the home to complete the work he said he would do.  The representative was very rude and began yelling on the phone and saying that they did not work for free.  She actually said this: "It sounds like you're trying to screw us."  I was meanwhile very calm and was telling her that I had every intention of paying but wanted to pay when the plumber returned to finish the work.  This was of course contingent upon the other company finishing what they had to do.  I wanted to work out a timeline of when this would be reasonable but she told me that the plumber would not come out until we got paid.  I told her that I would not pay until the plumber came out and before I could work out a timeline of when this should happen she hung up on me and said she would send me to collections.To be fair, I was able to call back and set up a payment timeline with another representative from the company who was more reasonable, and the plumber that visited the house was indeed friendly and appeared competent.  But the way that I was spoken to by the first representative left such a sour taste in my mouth that I will never do business with them again.  If those are the types of people they employ, there is something wrong with the business.  If that's as well as they train people that talk on the phone to customers, there is something wrong with the business.I can't believe that a company expects to get paid such large amounts of money for not doing any work at all and then accuses clients of expecting free work when they don't want to pay until a job is completed.I am not a customer who doesn't want to pay.  I have every intention of paying Scottsdale Plumbing company once they complete the work they said they would do.  But I was cut off by this rude representative before I was even given an opportunity to establish what would be a reasonable timeline or deadline for when this plumber would return to our home.  I have never had a company representative hang up on me before.  I thought they were all trained not to do that.  And here this lady was trying to collect money from me, but instead hung up on me.  She kept stressing how they could not afford to do work for free (which I was not asking anyone to do).  I suppose what they can afford to do is to lose customers, which is what will continue to happen if they speak to them the way that I was spoken to.A tip to the company: if you want people to pay you, try being a little nicer when you ask them for money.~~#~0
Sat down and first thing I notices was price. Embarrassed to walk out I gave it a try to see If any good. Ordered a margarita pizza for it was cheapest. What I got was a cheese sprinkled with basil and that was it.  I questioned that this was not a margarita and all the said was this is the way they make it.  Should change name on menu. At any rate the pizza was plain and a little dry.  Also there was no wood oven taste.  Overall we paid before tip $35 for a 12 inch pepperoni and a 12 inch margarita. Two cokes cost $7.  Not worth it and was not very good.Wil~~#~0
This seemingly is JUST for the home--not for people's clothes. I thought it was a JoAnn's competitor.Bolts and bolts of fabric on hanging rolls. Also carpets. No one said hello or offered to help us. No patterns here. They have designer fabric but i didnt check the labels.~~#~0
i heart that i saw Oasis and FOTC there, but i mostly love that i was kicked out of this A-hole venue for dancing to the CURE!  The Cure! that's right, the Phoenix heat bakes the life and Cool outta most everyone in the Valley of the Sun; so much so that if you are too lively at I dunno, a flippin rock concert, the cranky geriatric ushers act  up because they have no funds to retire. The dodge can SUCK it...and so can the mean old bitches and meth head grampas that work there.~~#~0
Very disappointing.  Had to go to Phx for a training and arrived later than expected last night and HUNGRY.  Our hotel was super close to RL and we were excited to get dinner.  I'm not sure if the fact that we arrived at 8pm explains how lacking the food was... or if I'm just trying to find an excuse for RL and how bad the food was.  L and I have been fans of Red Lobster for years.  We don't often get there but when we do, we are all set with our regular order of the popcorn shrimp.  Our server was very quick to get the food out,  which seems like a good thing but was also ready for us to leave ASAP.  I'm a bit confused by this because the restaurant is open until 10 and we left by 9:15.  Back to the food. Generally, I love those warm biscuits that are absolutely terrible for you. Last night, I only had one because it was neither  warm or tasty.  The salad was meh.  The popcorn shrimp was on the cold side and the fries were not terrible but were very salty.  The salty fries may have been my favorite thing and that is just plain sad.  Decided to go all out and have a specialty drink, which was really nothing special.  i ordered the Malibu Hurricane and it sure wasn't anything to excitedly Yelp about!  Red Lobster does an excellent job of tempting you with yummy looking commercials and endless shrimp for $15.99 but the reality doesn't come close to expectations.~~#~0
Check in screenflow might have more upsells and ads than a godaddy purchase. I lost count.  Red carpet club--snubs Amex plat members,--snubs continental (same alliance) club mbership cards and vouchers,--doesn't take cash, and--doesn't allow outside food or drink--wireless coverage is same as rest of terminal (piggybacks city of Phoenix free wifi) --leather chairs are tired and cushions lost their cush--coffee cups spotted and stinky--barman sits in a corner texting~~#~0
This is my very first Yelp review and I'm writing it to save others the experience I just had. I just ate at Teharu for the first time. Everything was going well, the sushi was pretty decent considering their awesomely cheap prices. The service wasn't the best for sure but my boyfriend and I were totally enjoying the experience....UNTIL....a nasty cockroach crawled right up the wall in front of me and made its way onto a ceramic jar sitting on the counter in the kitchen. No one noticed it, not even when the sushi chef stood in front of it to wash his hands. It crawled in and out of the jar and all over the counter top. My boyfriend and I took pictures of it and still no one noticed. Since our appetites were completely gone at that point (there was no way were going to finish the rest of our sushi) we asked for a manager. There was no manager working so I asked for a supervisor. A lady came to us and asked us what we needed. When we told her she just walked away from us and told another employee to come talk to us. He came over and I told him what happened and he just said, "Oh, really?" So they gave us our check, we paid, and that was the end of it. There was no apology or anything. It was disgusting to say the least. One would think that having a kitchen open in everyone's view would tend to be a little cleaner, but after closer inspection I noticed that the glass surrounding the kitchen was very nasty and obviously hadn't been cleaned in some time and I could only imagine what the floor looked like beyond the glass right where the roach came from. I wouldn't have even given them one star but I guess Yelp requires at least one star.Take a look on Maricopa County's Environmental Services website regarding this restaurant. http://www.maricopa.gov/envsvc/envwebapp/tabs/results.aspx?navigatedFrom=businessResultsDrillDown&mc_perm_id=217877&business=HARU%20SUSHI&address=9845%20%20%20S%20%20PRIEST%20DR&permitid=SG62199~~#~0
Stopped here for lunch with my wife at about 11:30 - food steam trays were cold - asked if there was a problem - was told steam trays were not working right - they would give nothing off the bill even though we ate only a couple of spoonsful. Should have called the health dept. Will not eat here again.~~#~0
Skip it.... No taste and pretty bland. Don't skip, unless your a starving college student on a budget. They do give generous portions~~#~0
We keep giving this place a chance, but we always seem to head home disappointed. The space is amazing, so we really want to love this spot!!  I feel like I could sit in the garden all day.  Then the food and "service" come and we get slapped back to reality.  My girlfriend is done attempting to get eggs that don't come out cold.  I mean, really, we may sit on the far end of the garden (our favorite spot) but it's not like we're down the street!  Cold watery eggs, even with the yummy fillings, are never a treat.  I've tried a little of everything, but I am a sandwich guy.  I used to argue in favor of the turkey, but on my last two visits it was lacking turkey and extra bacony.  I tried to go for the french toast instead, but it was just soggy and cold.  All I end up asking is who's running the show?  I often feel bad for the service staff, because they generally look unhappy and frantic.  They frowns definitely transfer to the people around them.  This place should seriously look at having a normal service, because most of the time it just looks disorganized.  I've watched servers walk the garden 3 times to find the table they are looking for.  3 times!!  No wonder Sarah's eggs are always cold!We gave it several shots because we kept hoping it was just growing pains.  Sadly, I cannot justify giving them more of my money to leave unhappy.~~#~0
RA is awful. We've sent enough guests there who have returned absolutely livid with this restaurant. No serious complaints about the food, but the service is just atrocious. I admit I'm mildly addicted to the ginger dressing they use on their side salads, but the methadone for that addiction is my abhorrence for the service. I will never go back here, but I may just convince my significant other to pick me up a side salad.~~#~0
My boyfriend and I went to happy hour on Sunday. They had great deals, and we were excited to try something new. I had a long island, and he got a beer that he had never tried before. It was obvious that he did not like the beer, since he asked me to finish it. The bartender came by, and double checked to make sure everything was ok. When he told her he did not like the beer, she was gracious enough to let him order another drink on the house. She was very kind, and friendly with this situation. We were both really appreciative and wanted to convey our positive experience to the manager. I told the manager that we were having a great experience and really enjoyed our time. He then proceeded to role his eyes, walk away, and yelled "Did she pay you to say that"! UNACCEPTABLE!!!! I was astonished at how rude he was when I was trying to give him a compliment. I have tried reaching the store owner/general manager with this complaint. I will never give them any of my business every again.~~#~0
I am asking conscientious consumers who believe in voting with their dollars to boycott this establishment because they tow the cars of paying customers.A week ago me and three friends met at the IHOP (International  House of Pancakes) on Apache and Forrest.   I left a HUGE tip to make up for the fact that we didn't purchase all that much food, and the waiter was quite nice. When one friend arrived at IHOP, he thought we were meeting by my dorm (which is literally across the street) and walking over, so he parked at IHOP, called us and walked across the street. And in less than 30 seconds walked BACK across the street and into IHOP.His car was towed WHILE HE WAS INSIDE IHOP. We walked out, couldn't find his car and didn't panic. We knew in our hearts that as PAYING CUSTOMERS, an honest mistake was made and they would take care of us. Nope, not the case. I immediately went back in and asked for the reciept, which the cashier gave me. She was very nice and apologetic and reassuring. As I did that, the one who's car was towed was on the phone with the towing contractor who told him we needed to get a note from IHOP's manager. OK easy enough. So we asked and he began writing the note, and then for whatever reason he called the towing company.Because the towing company's payed spotter (you know that this towing is lucrative for them if they pay a spotter to look for students) saw him cross the street he refused to write a note saying that we were paying customers. I still can't believed this happened. We argued with him for a while, started out quite nice but it degenerated. I swear the manager was smiling for most of the time while telling us "there was nothing he could do." Ultimately he lied to us and said it was the responsibility of the hotel because they had contract with the towing company. So far, we have been unable to resolve this in a reasonable way.It kills me how businesses here treat students. Because there are so many of us, they realize that they can treat us poorly and take advantage of us all over the place, and no matter how many they drive away there will always be more students. I feel really powerless about this, I don't know what I can do to fix it except tell everyone what happened. So I am asking you to PLEASE not go to IHOP while they maintain this policy of abusing students. We can fight back by boycotting them!~~#~0
John Ghiz with Arizona Mobile Pet grooming did a horrible job on my two dogs. He was rather wheezy and tired looking and had my golden and corgi in the van for over two hours and when I called out to him he opened the door and the dogs were only half done. He missed some nails on both dogs, did not clean out their ears, brush them or trim them. He just washed them. Worst and most expensive grooming EVER.~~#~0
I was suprisingly displeased this time around. It was my 2nd time there and it wasn't anything like I remembered. The salad was DRENCHED in dressing (which I hate) so if you don't like that, get your dressing on the side. All I ordered was the soup and salad lunch special. They brought me my first salad which consisted of, literally, maybe 11 pieces of iceberg lettuce, 3 slivers of carrots, 4 slivers of cabbage, and about 8oz of dressing!! absolutely disappointing. I ordered my second salad with the dressing on the side and, of course, they brought me a REAL-SIZE salad the 2nd time. They should have done that the first time. The service was slow as hell and they brought us 2 loaves of bread (bc we had a party of 7) with only 1 knife. It was retarded all around. Just about everyone else was dissatisfied with their meals. It was lunch hour, I'll give them that....but they weren't even busy!!! Never going there again :(~~#~0
Worst OB office I have ever been to. Originally I thought they were great, but as my pregnancy progressed they were a NIGHTMARE!The receptionist girls are extremely rude, both over the phone and in person.The Dr and PA do not take any health issues seriously. Even after a hospital stay, they still did not pay any attention to my health needs. Their solution for everything is jamming medications down your throat instead of finding the root cause of the issue.Even worse, these medications are not safe and several of them were Category C, which are known to cause birth defects. After a few trips to the pharmacy where a Pharmacist told me NOT to take them, a change in dr was the only solution.Do not trust your health or the well being of your baby with this office.~~#~0
This place is close to my house.  The wash is nothing special.  The service is the worst.  The final straw is that my friend bought a $125 gift certificate for me.  Turns out it has an expiration date within 30 days.  I went in a few days later than that (she didn't mention and I didn't notice the expiration) and they would not honor it.  I would advise using this place as a last resort and NEVER give them any money before they perform the service.  They are going to look for an excuse to keep your money.~~#~0
The food is ok if you're disparate.  It' usually pretty greasy so I don't go there often.  I'm sick of the attitude of the girls behind the counter.  Vary arrogant and they always seem angry.  Honestly, I seriously feel like I'm not welcome there because I'm not hispanic.  You have to beg for salsa.  The place is always full of derelict punk teens constantly throwing the ef word around and spitting.  Go to Taco Bell up the street, yes the food is actually better. They also need to clean the place up.  Went there today and it was bad.  I won't be going back.~~#~0
So as you can tell by the previous review, I was pretty impressed with the prices of various products on my last trip to Best Buy, but wow the costs for their services is ridiculous.My parents bought me a car stereo on Christmas Eve. As I picked one over budget I paid for the installation. And as it was the last one on the shelf, I also bought the installation kit for my car since no employee was around to help me, I figured better safe than sorry. The kit was $22 and I was still charged $80 for the installation. So basically I paid $102 for the installation.I was however impressed with the speed in which the stereo was installed. Forty-five minutes. But still $102 to install a $162 stereo?Its my fault for not doing some shopping around first. Fry's Electronic has same stereo, $10 more and $20 install. Audio Express has the same stereo for $37 more with $1 install...As you can see from my review on Absolute Computers in February, its common for Best Buy to charge such outrageous fees.http://www.yelp.com/biz/absolute-computers-paradise-valley#hrid:Kdb_Vx1vgQOHujxXVSixnAThey also do window tint. 3 years ago I had old tint removed and new tint put in an old truck. It had 5 windows, cost $75. On a whim I asked what it would cost to have the 2 front windows (passenger and driver) get new tint (and have the old tint removed). Quoted price was $125. For two windows.~~#~0
We never got a table since their "reservation" policy is call a month before you want to go. That's OK, so we showed up on a week night and put our name in. It was about 5:30 and they said the wait was 2 hours (!), so we walked around downtown instead of waiting for a table *at their own bar next door*. When we came back they'd bumped us (drawn a line through our name and put us lower on the page) and said the wait would be an hour and once again "we were welcome to wait at their bar next door". They must walk over and announce names? Why not take our phone number or give us one of those buzzers? I'm sure the pizza is wonderful but the scam of waiting nearly all evening at their bar isn't acceptable. What a shame that a place of such renown has such contempt for its patrons.~~#~0
this place is dirty and the food sucks~~#~0
This place just has bad food.  I've been there twice and been disappointed both times.  All I remember from the first time was the shockingly horrible rice and beans.  How does a Mexican restaurant not make good beans and rice?  The beans were bland and the rice was old and hard and like the beans, had no flavor.The second time, I had a chile relleno, it's supposed to be an egg based batter around the chile.  This was just egg.  It was like a chile inside an omlette.  Which although not like mom used to make should taste good too but it was just swimming in oil.This place had a ownership change a few years ago and I am certain this place is just living off of it's old reputation.  There are a few people who grew up with this place and they continue to recommend it.  Oh and don't go to the place next door either, Tony's sucks too.~~#~0
After I wrote about my bitter experience after the death of my daughter almost two months ago, I was hoping for but only half-expecting a response. Didn't get one, or so I thought. Just found this gem in my junkmail folder. This message sounds like a forced apology to me, not heartfelt or sincere -- all about her, not one word of concern for a client who is hurting badly. How sad.Hello Betina,I just wanted to send my sincere apologies for our exchange last week. I have felt very bad about it ever since. I understand that you will probably not ever return to Hot Yoga Ahwatukee but I at least wanted to say I am sorry.Sandra(That's the owner.)~~#~0

So so sad....nothing like the Trader Vic's from days gone by.... Food is meh.  FIrst mai tai ok but the second comped one (thanks to Yelp check in) I swear had zero alcohol. Seriously.  TV, don't play the game if you're gonna cheat.  Won't be back.~~#~0
They don't even make their own "fior di latte", the extremely important gelato base that is at the heart of any serious, authentic gelato. Arlecchino down the street is like a gazillion times better! And, they are actually Italian!!!!!!!!!!!!!Even Italian tourists I've seen go into Arlecchino were like, practically in tears over the magnificent artistry of the super-quality, super delicious authentic concoctions they were tasting. So why do people go to less authentic places? Well, it's like this: if one has only ever tasted generic, inferior quality grocery store ice-cream from the supermarket, and has never tasted, say, Haagen Dazs, then one wouldn't know the difference. Well ragazzi, it's time to taste the real mccoy...just have to drive a few minutes down the street where their gelato really does hit the "g-spot" (hehe!!)  :)Non mangiate mai le schifezze, santa pace!!~~#~0
I ordered online to use the $5 off $10 coupon. By the time I got home -- 3 miles away -- my fries were ice cold and my Blast was soup. This was my first time going to Sonic and it'll also be my last.~~#~0
Horrible service!!!I was visiting from LA and we hav tons of hookah places. Since the moment we sat down they gave us a huge attitude. After seating us it took them over 10minutes to even akcnowledge us. They had only 4 other tables so not busy at all and the waiter visited them several times before he even responded to me flaging him down. I asked him for any hoolah he would like to bring us. 10min later the hookah arrived but we had to wait another 5 mins to get charcol. They put this tiny charcols which went out in a few minutes. I actuallt had to get up and go to ask for more. Then i asked the waiter is he can give me a menu to order some food and something to drink. He said ohh the kitchen is closed. I said well can I atleast get a drink? He said sure and got me a beer.  The interesting part was that they continued serving the other tablea with food atleast 30minutes after i asked him. Service is the key in these kind of business. I guess that is acceptable in Arizona but this place would not survive one day in LA. Poor management...~~#~0
I fail to see a reason for this store to even exist.Item selection in this store is sporadic, poor, the quality can not be attested to and the prices are completely arbitrary.The store it self has a dirty and temporary feel to it. The crowd that this store attacks is also less than savory.The store seems out of place in this neighborhood and has little use to me. Other than looking for Halloween costume crap I would not recommend stopping in here.~~#~0
Stopped into this shop during spring training.  The staff was nice but he really pushed the Kristoffs as he had the vendor in the shop.  We bought 3 of them based on the recommendation and we were going to get a box if we liked them.  The cigars didn't draw well and were generally not very good.  We went back into the shop to let them know and they offered absolutely nothing after we had spent $170 there the day before and only bought the Kristoffs on their recommendation (at 10 a stick).  We won't be going back.~~#~0
I hate the people who wright long negative reviews but I am EXTREMELY upset we wasted our time here. Last night my boyfriend and I went on a double date to Metro Brasserie for Valentines day. This particular Valentines happened to be particularly significant for us. We had plans to start dinner at 6, grab some ice cream down the street, and had reservations at another function after at 8. Upon arriving we found that our reservation was not for the correct time, however they were not busy at all and got us a nice table (right on the walkway) out on the patio. When our server finally decided to come and take our drink order, we had had enough time to know our complete order, drinks, apps, and entrees. When 7:15 rolled around we still did not have our entrees, someone came by and told us that one of our stakes was overdone, had to be re-fired and that it would be about 5-7 minutes longer. At 7:45 we FINALLY received our food, my boyfriends burger was much too rare and sent it back (at that time we realized the server never asked how he would like it cooked). Since we had reservations elsewhere at 8:00 we threw all of our food into to-go boxes at an attempt to make it. We talked to a manager (who happened to be the person who told us that it would be 5-7 minutes longer PSH!) he took 50% off our bill, leaving our total bill for 4 people at $150! To top it all off, in our rush to make our next reservation WE FORGOT OUR FOOD WE DIDN'T GET TO EAT ON THE TABLE! I am so unbelievably upset that we choose to spend an extremely special night here and ended up, hungry, pissed off, AND missed our next reservation. I will NEVER EVER EVER tell anyone one good thing about this restaurant, and it looks like were not the only ones. THANK YOU METRO BRASSERIE FOR RUINING 4 PEOPLES VALENTINES DAY!!!!!!!~~#~0
I would give it zero stars.I work there and their company and management is full of shit.Fuck Macy's.~~#~0
Some girl I know said she went to China Chili and it was the best Chinese food she's ever had. After she told me that I went to China Chili the next day. The menu is standard for a Chinese restaurant nothing special. We ordered some beef dish for our meal and a side of chow mein. The beef was chewy and the chow mein was bland. I do not understand why people love China Chili. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to my worst enemy!~~#~0
Ok...First off I have to say I don't usually judge a place off the reviews and like to give it a shot. Well this was a bad idea... especially on an anniversary dinner celebration. Please be advised that the bad reviews are indeed true. We have eaten the food through their catering and it is delicious, so this makes me think all the energy is expelled here alone? Like the other reviews had said this is a creepy outdated awkward place that doesn't have any background music playing at all. So yes the tables are very close together with no music so imagine how uncomfortable that will be. We immediately ordered martinis to try and ease the mood. My dirty martini was garnished with tiny olives on a sandwich pick for an upscale price. The server also spilled most of my wife's martini during her trip to the table saying how it was "overfilled." We received a basket of bread that was burnt and unappealing which ended our idea of a maybe hopeful outcome. We were both confused because the dinner menu was nothing like we had eaten through catering. The server informed us that we had probably meant to dine at the "bistro," and was happy to transfer us over next door. Feeling questionable that it would be any better we paid our tab and agreed to go take a table they were holding for us. We then walked over to the bistro side of the restaurant only to be disappointed once again.  Packed in like a meat house and sat there for 15 minutes without being asked if we'd like a drink we decided to walk out. They have again an awkward system of seat yourself and apparently serve yourself as well? We were so confused by all the groups of people lining outside to get in this place. We were more than willing to give up our table to the next unfortunate guest. The parking lot is also a joke like a previous person had reviewed. It is only valet and gets backed up by the cars coming in and the one attendant trying to run the place. Some lady thought I was a valet driver and proceeded to yell at me because I was standing around not helping her. We are in our late 20's and knew we were in "Snotsdale" all the way.~~#~0
This is a KFC and a Taco Bell combined.  This is the closest taco bell to my area and after the last 4x in a row of getting my order wrong I won't ever go back and have lost faith in Taco Bell at other locations also.  The drive thru is extremely slow all hours of the day.  The employees are grumpy and no smiles are to be seen. Don't dare tell them your order was wrong because they will let you know that YOU must have ordered it incorrectly. KFC has the smallest pieces of chicken I have ever seen. Mini chicken farmers must be where they purchase their products. A thigh was about the size of a chicken wing at a pizza parlor.  It's often over fried also. Taco Bell my order is ALWAYS wrong. I like extra sauce... If I ask for it I will get NO sauce at all... Every time without fail. So I stated asking for green sauce on the side so I could get my extra sauce.. I have to explain to them to just put it in a container. It's not rocket science. I rarely make special requests like this but if I purchase extra sauce and don't get it this to me is being an untrustworthy company.   I Ussually have missing items, never give napkins in the drive thru either.  My last time there I got someone else order... It was a very large order and I just drove off with it. I was so feed up with the BS and mistakes I kept it. I ordered a burrito and got a meal for 4 LOL.~~#~0
So, yeah, I am totally one of those Yelpers who shops at  a place that they grumble about. Same prices as local Whole Foods on most products, especially on local and organic produce. Pricing structure relies heavily on weekly specials to give the sense of being an overall better deal. Calling something a farmer's market automatically knocks perceived prices down 0.3% after all. A lot of the Sprout's store brand items include fillers and are relatively lower priced due to Sprout's raising the prices of other brands in the same categories being sold. Some of the prepackaged roasts and grab-and-go dinners now have meat-product cut with filler soy protein vs. being meat, while still having prices raised. Prices for staple products in the bakery have raised, for some loaves of bread pretty significantly. Kind sucks that there are now less soy-free, vegan or gluten-free options for people with dietary restrictions/allergies to worry about. The produce quality has declined since transitioning to a Sprout's store, and I am hoping that they better manage moisture and keep veggies rotated so that my family can take advantage of some produce sales to get good stuff. There is nothing worse than rooting around to get a few pounds of summer squash and feeling your fingers sink into slime. Except maybe also getting that slime under your fingernails.There's still some distribution stuff to work out I guess.Even if they manage a lower cost on a produce item that I can get from WF the produce is often in rougher shape and won't hold up as long before cooking (same or next day in most cases). YMMV, but to my monkey brain this kinda negates saving a nickle per pound. When this was a Sunflower Market the prices were competitive and lower than Whole Foods, now it is just a place that I hit to buy cat food and reasonably priced ricotta. Also a few bath and beauty items that are higher priced at WF and I am too lazy to order on-line. #YelperProblems~~#~0
The only reason I am giving this 1 star even though I will probably go back to do some shopping for packaged food and such from time to time but will NO LONGER be tasting the free food is the fact that I witnessed one of the food tasters blowing her nose while standing at a food tasting table, and NOT only did she NOT wash her hands, but she did NOT change the plastic gloves that she was wearing before continuing to handle food to give out as samples. I was so stunned that i just had to walk away. Yes it was my fault for not bringing it to a managers attention but if you could have seen the stunned look on my face. She did not notice me but I damn sure noticed her. STUNNED! I remember exactly what she looks like and will be reporting her but again just stunned that she did that in plain view of everyone. Can we say blech?!?!~~#~0
WORST DINING EXPERIENCE EVER! I GOT SHRIMP A LA PUBE HAIR. So I just left this roach motel and I am sick so I am letting people know. I went there because my co-worker heard it was ok. Unfortunately for me I paid before eating so the chairs all have holes in them and the place looks creepy and no one, and I do mean no one, speaks English, which would not have been a problem  had not pulled hair from my food! I had not eaten very much when I asked for the manager, who I now refer to as, "Chow Mein". She was the rudest monster I have ever seen, and I watch horror films. Chow Mein screamed at me in Chinese and refused to do anything. Unfortunately, since I had paid already ofcourse she would not give me back my money or do anything to make up for the fact that her hair was in my food. All she did was scream at me. The waitress even told her that I did not eat and was there to witness me pull the hair from my food and Chow Mein was mad at the waitress for admitting it was in my food. Needless to say I urge you to eat anywhere else but here! i am sick and I may leave work early because my stomach is so upset.~~#~0
Came here today just to get a massage, and sadly it is no longer at this location.  I'm not sure if they have relocated, or simply gone out of business.~~#~0
HORRIBLE!!!!!! My husband and I wanted some good breakfast there were some mixed reviews on this place, so we decided to try it... I sat down and ordered the Strawberry Waffle and bacon, my husband ordered the chopped Steak and eggs... My SO-Called strawberry waffle came with NO strawberries and the bacon was thin as paper. I asked where my strawberries were to put on the top of my waffle and she said they were inside my waffle... MY WAFFLE LOOKED LIKE A BIG STRAWBERRY EGGO BUT FLATTER THAN A PANCAKE. To top it off my Husband got his SO-called chop steak and eggs...LMAO they brought him a fried HAMBURGER Patty dripping in grease! Sent it back, left and went to mcdonalds.... WAFFLE HOUSE MY ASS!!!!!!!!!!~~#~0
I had been referred to the Queen Creek location in the beginning of my pregnancy for an ultrasound since my insurance wouldn't allow the Dr's office to perform it, and I had to go 3 times and they still were unable to get a full complete ultrasound that was to the doctors satisfaction. (they failed to get important information) so I ended up going to a completely different place and they got it all done 1 shot. Now I have to go back for a growth ultrasound and I called to make an appointment and was informed they would not be able to accommodate me and my 3 kids if I brought them! Seriously!! The lady was so rude about it, almost laughing when I told her I would have them with me, because I don't have a babysitter during the day. I canceled the appointment and will be going elsewhere again and never returning to them!~~#~0
Pretentious and overrated.This is the kind of restaurant for people who a) miss New York, or b) don't know what they're talking about.  This is the kind of restaurant where you'll pay $200 for $100 worth of food.  It's not that it's bad, it's that it's pretentious.  To pay this kind of money is a strip shopping center is...overrated.Yes, the owner-hostess it's just not worth it.  Very snooty to other patrons she deemed unworthy, save the money, go elsewhere.~~#~0
Drive through takes forever in the morning 20 minutes for one burrito. Egg Shells in my Carne Asada Burroito after I waited forever  :(~~#~0
This is one of my neighborhood restaurants, although I've only eaten in once. My coworker usually gets to-go for the office. I've had their fries and salads; I've found the fries overly salted and the salads overly dressed. I recently had brunch in the restaurant finally; I got the special, which was two eggs any style over country gravy and biscuits. The biscuits were like pucks -- nothing fluffy or buttery about them. They broke off in unsavory chunks, and on top of that, had arrived barely warm. The gravy was runny and wasn't particularly special; in fact I'll admit it looked a bit gross because it had chunks of chicken meat in it. I would say it looked a bit like runny chicken vomit. The potatoes and eggs were really the only things that looked appetizing on the whole plate and what I ended up eating the most.~~#~0
I was there this weekend, both Saturday and Sunday for a Youth Tournament for my son. Our "home bowling alley" is the Brunswick Zone on Southern and Dobson. This was my first time to this particular alley. This was the worst bowling alley I have ever been to in my entire 31 years of living. The location is hidden back behind some office buildings. The building is plain, late 60's decor. The interior, from what I was told, had not been updated in over a decade at least. The newest renovation was a strip of fluorescent carpeting and some fluorescent paint on the walls. (for neon bowling I presume) There is no real seating for the bowlers. There are tables and chairs randomly placed through out the building. Each table only gets 4 chairs, so if someone else steals a chair or you have more than 4 bowlers, someone is going to have to stand.  On a rack, in the corner, in the back, there are about 20 alley owned balls, so good luck getting one in the right weight. The bathrooms are tiny and dilapidated.  Whole chunks missing out of several spots in the tile. The handicapped stall has a baby changing station that does not fold up. It stays wide open, so you can't even get in there. The flusher in that stall also gushes when you flush, so you might want to flush with your foot. There are only about 20 lanes, and they are occupied by what seems like permanent residents, over the age of 80. They didn't even want to leave for the alley-sponsored tournament. The food was just thrown together. Nachos were a plate full of chips, and a tiny cup of cheese sauce. 2 small sodas ran me over $6. The overpriced snack bar didn't even accept credit/atm cards because their phone line was down. The lanes were so slick and greasy, they practically had puddles of oil in them. Lane 4 occasionally goes completely dark while people are bowling. They do NOT have a pro shop. Their arcade games were few, and broken. I don't think they serve alcohol.I did not see a bar.I would never, ever come to this bowling alley again by choice. Even the AMF on Main that closed last year was better than this one. They should have closed this one instead. If you're looking for a place to bowl, I would suggest you go anywhere but here.~~#~0
This place used to have the best tasting, mouth watering donuts in Anthem.  After change in ownership, they skimped on sprinkles, fillings, and more!  The recipe from previous owners were not followed.  They cheapened the recipe....Buy your donuts anyplace but here, even the grocery store donuts taste better.~~#~0

Did you know that Marky Mark is the same person as Mark Wahlberg?And why did I mention this?  Because that is what the three workers (one I know was a manager) were debating about while I was waiting for my sandwich...and sandwich that was waiting to be handed to me.  Five minutes later....my name was called....another employee gave it to me...while the three guys were still talking about Marky Mark.  I was told that I had to go to this "amazing sandwich"...the best sandwich in America.  Well...service wise...this place is awful.  The guy taking my order had severe ADD...(would you like a drink with that?  "No thank you"...ok would you like a regular or large drink?  Or!  "What is the total?"  Moron behind the counter..."The cookie is $1.29)  Food wise?  There was nothing...absolutely NOTHING about that sandwich (Chicken Cheesesteak)  that would make me forget about the bad counter service so I would go back.  The chicken was bland and extremely greasy.  I am still feeling the effects of the pit in my stomach of bottomless grease.Sorry Caprioti's....not going back.~~#~0
God this place is awful!!  Did it change hands between 1/19/09 when Matthew K. was there & 1/27/09 when I was there?¿?The sign on the side of the building says "OPEN EAT" ...Straight forward & direct!  I liked that, so I tried it.Inside & out, the place looks very old.  I would guess 1940s.  It's medium in size, & there were about 25 trays of food out.  There were only about 5 other customers in the place on a weekday at 12:30, which was my first warning sign.  The second was the egg flower soup.  It was gooey & blah (1940's style, I wondered?).The food table was against the wall, so you have to reach far for the items that are in the back.  The ranch dressing was runny, & the macaroni salad blah.  The unfriendly Chinese lady brought me some "hot tea", which was lukewarm.  Back at the food table, the rest of the food was greasy, not very warm, or both.  The whole deal was seriously terrible... the second worst restaurant I have ever eaten at, after Wagon Wheel, Oxnard, CA.  (Fortunately that place finally folded & this one needs to as well!)"OPEN EAT somewhere else!"~~#~0
Will not be returning there.~~#~0
Disappointing overcooked tofu cubes.  Food did not appear or taste fresh.  Will not return.~~#~0
I went in to see Dr. Kahn as an emergency appointment.  It felt like I had a stick in my eye.  When he came in, he spent 2 minutes looking in my eye and said I had pink eye.  I took the eye drops, but two weeks later, the feeling of the "stick" in my eye never went away.  I went back in and he informed me that I had something else (that was a scare on my eye) and that my vision might be affected and not fixable.  I'm not a happy person with him.  Why did he not see this the first time?  I would not go to him if you have an emergency.  If you just want to check your vision, then he's a nice guy.  I'm suffering with blurred vision in one of my eyes, and it is here to stay.~~#~0
The course was in very good shape, but the round took 5.25 hours.  The booking agents seemed to be put off by the business, and when we finished our round, we were told that the Grill was closed for drinks, but we could go inside to shop for apparel.  For the price, this was the worst golf experience of my life.~~#~0
Always pass by this place so we thought we would stop and give it a try. I'm thinking that was a mistake. First of all, we have been to a lot of Mexican restaurants and have never seen a menu like this, it was basically foreign to my fiance and I. We both had some questions about a few things on the menu that we planned to ask our waitress. Only when the waitress came to take our order we discovered that she barely spoke any English. When our food came it wasn't what either one of us expected. Apparently I ordered a chicken quesadilla, which I wrongly assumed was going to be enchiladas. Food was very bland. Needless to say, we wont be going back.~~#~0
I agree with all the other reviewers so far. This festival was one of the most poorly planned events I have ever been to. It all started when I purchased 2 tickets via groupon for $10. Arriving at the event I waited about 30 min to park my car which cost me another $5. Once I entered the festival the lines for each truck were awful. Not only that, you couldn't see the menus very well to see what each truck was serving. Not all of them are blatantly marked. The first line we stood in ran out of food. The next two lines we attempted didn't move....at all. I'm serious. I don't know what was going on up in those food trucks, but I wasn't getting any closer to eating the longer I waited. Also, can I mention that you still have to pay for the food. Oh yes, you pay to enter this event, and then pay to eat. After 90 minutes of waiting in lines and not eating I was hungry, frustrated, irritated, thirsty, and down right pissed off. We left. I therefore spent $15 for a boat-load of aggravation and ate no food at this food festival. What a complete waste of time.~~#~0
Not pleased with service. Very poor customer service.~~#~0
Sonic use to be so good. I miss the fire island burger they use to have many years ago. That was their best burger. This location's food was not worth the stop. Burger was dry, bacon was burned beyond belief (see pic), toast wasn't even toasted, and the tater tots were super salty. The cranberry sprite I got was good but that was the only refreshing thing I received. Will not go back.~~#~0
This company does not deliver on what it says.  It takes money and does a little bit then wants more money and now my project (bathroom remodel) has gone on for over 5 months with not one aspect completed.  Stay away from them.~~#~0
Ended up spending $40 on a margarita, three beers, and one entree during happy hour. (I still tipped, the waiter was friendly and it's not his fault everything but the Corona tasted like a sweaty butt crack).The dark bock microbrew tastes like bitter, cheap sake and smelled like margarita mix. The regular margaritas taste like corn syrup and wetnaps. The food was average and way overpriced. The red sauce tastes like spicy, water potting soil. I ate some of my sister's food as I didn't even order anything because they were charging $16 for a freaking chicken fajita. But the worst thing was the swarm of flies buzzing around our table on the newly-enclosed patio. I was swatting the air like a schizophrenic hobo.~~#~0
I absolutely despise feeling like I've been judged not worth someone's time due to their assumptions about my financial status based on my outward appearance.And this time it wasn't even by a girl in a G-String on a pole!Okay, so anyone who reads my reviews knows I'm not regularly dining high on the hog, but don't the beautiful rich people slum around in workout gear sometimes, too?So after a recent run down Central Ave, one of my K9's and I decided to partake in a little of the awesome concept Donald S calls RETOXIFYING.  A little snack and some wine out on the patio sounded great to me, so I went over to Bomberos.It was early in the day, so they weren't at all busy, there were only a couple of other customers either inside or out.  I walked in and out between the patio and the inside seating area several times over a few moments, purposefully contorting my face into the restaurant patron's "where do I go?" look.  Since the server's work station and door to the kitchen area were in that narrow hallway, I actually was in the way of the couple of servers who were there trying to move to and from the two dining areas.I did not get greeted at all, either before or after I had to stop one of them and ask for a menu. I sat and reviewed the menu for a several minutes, all the while continuing my confused, helpless patron routine.Nothing.With nary a peep out of the servers, I walked away.My tendency to frequent $ instead of $$$$ places comes less from a lack of means than it does from my countless experiences that what you get for your $$$$ is often not worth it.  If I have a 2* experience at a $ restaurant, I may be a little upset, but if I have a 2* experience at a $$$$ establishment, I'm going to be postally pioughd.Bomberos may treat you like one of the Sunnyslope Elite, if you show up looking like you are one of the Sunnyslope Elite.  Maybe then their overpriced wine and admittedly tasty looking nosh might seem worth it.  (It IS all from South America)  Without friendly or at least minimally cordial customer service, they can stuff it up their stuffy butts.I ended up stopping at a nasty dirty nearby Sonic (limited options due to the dog, remember) where both the order-taking electronic voice and the rollerskate-less carhop both had the decency to ask me how I was doing that day.~~#~0
Skeezy is the perfect word for this place. All the G&D branding has been removed, so it is "Name to Be Determined" Restaurant. The drinks aren't stiff, the clientelle are scary, the food was bland and/or bad. Avoid this place.~~#~0
Waiter got my order wrong the first time. Had to send it. back. Came back looking like they just dumped half of it. I'm just dreading what they did to my food. Waiting (movie) anyone? Food wasn't great either. Avoid.~~#~0
I have been to other 5 & DIner restaurants and enjoyed my meal, especially the one at the Scottsdale Pavillions. However, I have now had two disappointing meals at the diner at the Arizona MIlls in Tempe. Today's lunch was a terrible affair.We arrived at about 12:30PM and there was maybe only two or three tables occupied. What we'd hoped would mean quick service was anything but. It took forever to get a waitress to take our order, and then a very long time for our meal.I ordered a bacon cheeseburger (was not asked about how done I wanted it, what kind of cheese or anything -- just boom, bacon cheeseburger, NEXT) and my fiancee ordered the chicken finger appetizer.My burger was beyond well done, and dry, but greasy from the cheese and sauces. Furthermore the burger was cold -- and not just from the lettuce. I was hungry and waited too long to bother sending it back. I choked it down with the aid of some decent fries.M'lady's chicken fingers were mistakenly upgraded to a dinner plate, which included fries, corn on the cob, a biscuit, and gravy! So we basically paid double for an order for too much food because the waitress -- or cook -- didn't get the order right.Overall I'm extremely disappointed by this location. I now understand why there were so few people eating there as well.~~#~0
One of the worst restaurant I ever been to food wise, the only good thing about it is you would appreciate good food at good restaurants. Friendly staff~~#~0
I work at another Fry's Marketplace and all I can say is, "why?". There is no need for any of this, just put all the time and effort into giving us quality food and service, not luxury space and decoration. Silly.~~#~0
***************************Unsanitary Conditions**************************last time we ate at this "establishment" a cock roach crawled across the bar.  When we told the owner we were told that a shipment of produce was infected by roaches. No offer to refund the meal was offered. We delivered an email of disapproval to the owner upon which she responded with refunding the meal.today when we returned for the first time since that unfortunate incident the owner informed us we were no longer welcome in her establishment. It seems a roach infestation had lowered her Maricopa Health department score - which somehow was our fault for indicating to her that there was a problem.very disappointing.  This is a restaurant i've enjoyed for years and years but will never dine at again.~~#~0
The owner does not accept the birthday coupons that are emailed for this location.~~#~0
This place is NOT good. It smelled inside and the food was by far the worst Thai I've ever had.We usually go to Taste of Thai, but when I saw this had more reviews and a higher rating, we decided to give it a try. What a mistake!!! The pad thai was gross, the spring rolls were disgusting, the green curry was ok but the tom ka ghai was horrible! Yelpers really let me down on this one! I think it is recently under new management, so maybe these reviews are out of date, so steer clear!~~#~0
A total waste of time.  Walked in the clinic at 7:25 pm.  The place was all torn up with junk everywhere and I was beginning to question whether I wanted to have my kid seen there.  The lady working came out and said, "We close at 7:30 and (looking at her watch) it is 7:30, come back tomorrow at 8:30 am"  She never asked what we were there for or anything.  Very unprofessional wonder what credentials these clinic workers have.  The kind of attitude she had I can only assume this is a minimum wage worker who could care less about her job.  Actually even minimum wage workers will finish their line off even if their shift is over.  Not the kind of person you want providing medical attention. Obviously at 8:30 am there are much better options for medical care than a CVS clinic so we will see a real doctor tomorrow.~~#~0
My husband and lil son went ther for the first time last week, I usually go on yelp to choose my restaurants due to there reviews.What a disappointment this was. I ordered chile relleno which was in a can not fresh and there was more cheese on the plates we ordered more than anything. We try to go to restaurants at least twice a week and I try writting reviews on each. It seems that a lot of people like this restaurant but if you are a true Mexican I plan to differ.The only thing pleasant was the server. Will Not be going there again~~#~0
I kind of experienced some reverse racism here.. and it really pissed me off... yeah, I'm white.. doesn't mean I don't crave some great soul food once in a while.. thought the whole point of the golden rule was to leave your money on the table.. as I'm leaving.. dude asks me if i'm going to pay? tld him money was on the table...did'nt question any of the african american folk...  really ticked me off.. plus, cash only, real limited menu, no waffles, corn on the cob, mashed, really limited sides..and kind of mediocre IMO.. Staceys and lolos kick its ass... (Shrug)~~#~0
Awful  place. Don't go! They will rip you off. I had my car overheating and I had to stop at their location and get it fixed asap because I had to be at work that day. It was just the thermostat that needed to be replaced, and other mechanics will charge no more than 110$ for that. They told me that beside the thermostat the radiator hoses needed to be changed and I don't know what else. I agreed because I had no other choice at the moment. They charged me 360$, and told me that it will be an hour work. On the end it was 5 and a half hours of work. Totally DISHONEST mechanics. You don't want to go there if you want to save yourself lots of money and stress.~~#~0
As a general rule, most people are drawn to things they can't or shouldn't have.And with good reason. Once you cross the line, partaking in life's ill-gotten fruits, you wish you hadn't.This is where life whips out its great equalizer...the sudden realization that you've just fucked-up....getting involved with something never meant to be. I'm talking about Coal Burger.The many times we sat on the patio at Stingray Sushi, looking longingly across the way at Coal Burger. Its packed house. The people waiting for tables.The wafting aroma of flame broiled beef. It was too much. We were sucked in like a Vietnamese basket-whore, (so i hear) despite neither of us liking ground beef all that much.Missing lunch, we came here for an early dinner...like way early...like 4:30 early.There was us and one other party in the entire place.This is where CB defied all logical thinking patterns. Service was poor, and the burger even worse.We were informed when ordering how all burgers were cooked medium unless specified differently. Fine. I ordered extremely well, asking the meat be caramelized. My wife, medium.My wife's burger was rare, as in seared outside, tartare inside.Mine wasn't caramelized, unless black is the new caramel.How does this happen when there are only five (5) guests in the entire restaurant?There was a replacement burger and plenty of apologies, but that's not what I'm looking for when I spend twenty five bucks on two burgers and beers. CB...if your main product is burgers, and your default cooking method is medium, you might want to weigh the idea of having a timer somewhere in the kitchen...like next to the grill.What a waste.~~#~0
I was so excited to eat here after reading the reviews but we were never served so we finally left. We stood outside for 15 minutes waiting for a table then sat at our table for another 15 minutes waiting for menus, water, maybe some of those chips and salsa. After looking around and realizing that most of the patrons were also looking lustfully toward the kitchen over their empty tables, we decided to go elsewhere. I don't know what was going on, perhaps all their staff called in sick? We were never even able to catch the servers eye, it was so weird. It was a Friday night, maybe we'll try again on a weekday.~~#~0
Not much of a resort. I would have been very disappointed if we would have got a room there for a true resort stay.  We stayed there for the Cavecreek Wicked Halloween event. They did have a 24 hr shuttle which was great in that situation. The room was still better than the drunk tank but not by much. The room was very dated.  It didn't even have a fridge.  The lobby and grounds were nice for the most part but all in all I was not impressed. I have stayed at Holiday Inn Expresses nicer.~~#~0
They don't speak english very well. The chicken was very dry service sucked rude and unfriendly. chicken was tinny looked like they were on a diet.~~#~0
I reserved and paid for my rental online a month in advance.  I'll never do that again.  The longest line of all the car rental companies was at Budget.  While I waited in line over an hour other agencies were idle.When I finally got to a clerk I was greeted by a friendly woman that asked questions about my trip and plans for the week.  It was a ruse.  She was only looking for a way to up-sell me on a bigger vehicle (for a small additional fee), "highly recommended insurance," "at least get insurance to cover damage to the car," and pay for a full tank of gas with no credit for any gas still in the tank.When I refused all of the offers the clerk's friendliness went away.  At that point she wasn't interested in talking to me at all.Next time I'm going with Hertz.~~#~0
I avoid all clearchannel stations. Johnjay and Rich are garbage blah blah blah. Kid and Ruben made that station. Now it's just sorry and tired!~~#~0
The food wasn't awful, but the price is far too high for what you get. Individual tacos start at $3 ... Seriously?Our waiter, while nice and pretty up on refilling drinks, was otherwise terrible. He took the order wrong, blamed it on us for not being clear enough, leaving two out of three of us waiting another half hour for our desired meals. Then when the bill finally came, which was a really long time coming, the mistaken items still appeared on the tab. After talking with the manager those excess charges were removed.But then again with the TVs turned up so loud you have to shout at each other to have simple conversation, it's no shock that the waiter got the orders mixed up.Dinner here was a real comedy of errors. When a waitress brought us a basket of sliders and dropped them, pulled pork and tinga chicken splattering across the table, I couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity.~~#~0
This review is for NEW YEARS EVE ONLY!!!. My girlfriend and I had an 8:30 reservation and when we arrived there was a line out in front of the door. They were NOT ready for the 2nd seating and took almost 20 minutes to finally start getting everyone in and to their tables. 2. I ordered a very EXPENSIVE bottle of champagne and you would have thought the waiter would have taken care of us, but he pretty much ignored us. After he poured our champagne, he placed the champagne on the piano where ANYONE could have just poured themselves champagne from OUR BOTTLE. I had to ask him to get an ice bucket and move it NEXT to our table!!3. The waiter took our order for appetizers  which was about 6 different options and he would bring them to us with sauces. He brought back our "order" but had lobster claws and only a couple of stone crab claws. I asked for what we ordered and he went back to get more. He came back with only 4 and said this was ALL they had they were out. OUT after only 30 minutes into service!!??4. We ordered a Caesar Salad for 2 and when they brought it we tried it and you could tell it was pre prepared as the lettuce was soggy and the salad was over dressed!5 Dinner came and at least our steaks came out great.6. The waiter brought us dessert (no choice on this huh?) and they were from a crappy pre prepared bakery complete with the paper on the bottom of both desserts. Both un edible. 7. This was by reservation ONLY, so for you to be so totally UNPREPARED on service, food etc is inexcusable!! For the prices you charge, you should be ashamed!8. I have traveled around the world to some of the finest restaurants in major European cities and they know how to take care of their customers where you want to come back. Dominick's is arrogant and thinks they are the be all, end all. Guess what, you're NOT all that!! Restaurants are driven by customers and how you treat your customers will determine how well you will do. Unless you FIX your problems, not only will you fail for next New Years, but I can't see you being in business for long. In this economy restaurants are NOT a necessity and people will go where they are taken care of, as well as for the food. You're NOT cutting it with your customer service and for your sake, you need to take a good long look at how you're mistreating customers and change it. If not, you'll be another asterisk of "and this was where Dominick's USED to be!!"~~#~0
Okay, I have lived in Phoenix and in LA. I have always thought LA was more expensive until my experience at Maroney's Cleaners. Holy Crap Ohla!!! I paid $7.65 for a pair of lined pants to get cleaned by them. Now, I have paid anywhere from $1.50 to $5.50 but are you kidding me $7.65. Then to top it off...I was a bit disappointed in the actual dry cleaning service because my pants were not perfect!!! So, after I was done throwing a temper-tantrum in the tahoe I then proceeded to call and text everyone I know (okay just kidding) about my frustrations. The drive up service is convenient however the price is NOT WORTH IT!!!~~#~0
Poor customer service everytime. The first time I went through the drive through they gave my order to someone else (after waiting 15 minutes in the drive through) which created two unhappy customers, then wanted me to wait for an additional 10 minutes while they made the correct order. The second time my order was ready and the girl at the window was too busy talking to co-workers to notice. Good food, but go to another location.~~#~0
I was left speechless today... this is a VERY rare occurence. I have tried several chinese buffets in glendale and central phx that left me feeling 'whatever' or worse. I drove by this place a few times and it didnt look bad from outside. WOW... I was wrong. The best part is at the end!!!Lets start with service.The Spikey haired young guy working/texting behind the register was very apathetic when I asked how he was doing.. he mumbled something i didnt understand and handed me back my stapled receipt for two ( 20 bucks total) He just seemed very rude...not welcoming at all.Atmosphere... standard chinese buffet furniture.. whatever... the televisions were BLASTING spanish tv.... so annoying.Food...would have been mediocre if it was fresh.. it had been sitting out 4 hours... I spit out several things i tried and after getting down a few things.... we get to the most interesting part...I feel sick...I want to get this slop out of me before I get full blown poisoning...So I get up to go to the bathroom...Which SUPRISE!!! is inhabited by a 9 year old boy taking a dump with the stall door wide open and his two year old brother is NAKED!!!!! unravelling the TP roll beside him!!! WTF!?? seriously?? I go into the other stall to hurl and cannot even bring myself near the toilet...It was horrifying....yes teh bathroom was too gross to puke in! I reach out and grab the waste can ... feeling a bit better AND worse for what I have witnessed... I go back to my table and ask my friend to go to the restroom and confirm what I just saw... she comes back laughing...and about 30 seconds later out runs the naked toddler... YES THROUGH THE DININGROOM. The couple had to have like 7 kids...We burst out laughing and ran out of the building.. so freaking SURREAL.I am taking no artistic license here... Thems the facts.We keep asking each other if that REALLY happened. Disgusting!!!~~#~0
My family and I went to Butterfield's Scottsdale Restaurant Saturday Oct 1st at 1PM. Our party included my 90 year old Mother on a walker, as well my sister, her husband and their 17 year old son. My nephew ordered a Panini which was very small, my sister ordered some crepes which she felt were not very good, my brother in law and I ordered a Denver Omelette which I was going to split with my Mother. When everything came my omelette was not fluffy and generous like my brother in laws.  Mine was small, dry and with hardly any vegetables.When our server came back she said it would do no good for her to complain to the cook or the management, because they wouldn't listen to her and it needed to come from me. She then said she had many similar complaints from customers throughout that week about their omelettes.So when I received the bill I went to see the manager and he met me with an attitude like "why are you bothering me". I explained to him what we had ordered and told him there was a significant quality control problem with his omelettes and that I thought he would like to know.  I thought as a courtesy, I would let him know that he had a food quality problem that his server confirmed. He immediately said that our server never would have said that, and there is nothing wrong with our omelettes or anything else coming out of our kitchen. He as much as called me a liar, so I asked him for his card or at least his name, and he refused and told me if I didn't leave the restaurant he would escort me out and call the police, all because I asked him for his name or card.  I said I'm more than happy to leave the restaurant, but I have to pay the bill, however because you have verbally threatened me twice I am going to make this incident very public.  He at the point informed me that he was also an owner... all the more reason why he should want to hear customer's comments (I was told by another waitress that his name was Chris).He followed me back to the table and proceeded to threaten my 90 year old mother, my 17 year old Nephew and his parents who didn't even know about our discussion, that if they didn't leave the restaurant he was calling the police! This man's actions were despicable and unprofessional and left my family stunned and appalled.  My question is, why would anyone consider going to this restaurant when a manager/owner is disrespectful to his customers and frightens his employees.~~#~0
I hated this.  I nearly got lynched for saying so.  This place came highly recommended (by not only Food Network's Guy Fieri of DDD but ALL our friends) and everyone swears we must've just hit it on an "off" night...but it was completely abysmal!  I had the teriyaki chicken, carnitas pork, black beans, and jerk fried rice.  Hubby had egg foo young and some kind of burrito.  Honestly, it was like the bastard offspring of the crappiest TV dinner we've ever had.  ALL of the food had the exact same flavor and texture (uber-salty, flavorless, mush).  The restaurant was packed and dirty; they didn't bother to wipe down tables as customers vacated.  Also, they got annoyed and curt with you if you showed up at the register and do not have an order card filled out, as though you're supposed to automatically know they have a special ordering system.  Maybe they stopped making quality food when they learned they could ride on the notoriety the TV exposure got them...or maybe we did just hit it on a bad night.  Either way, we won't be back.~~#~0
This was our 4th rainforest cafe we have visited. My son picked it for his 5th birthday dinner, worst rainforest expierence ever! Our waitress was very rude, our order was incorrect twice, and she kept making it worse, by screwing it up more, I didn't realize a plain cheeseburger was so hard! For a $200 bill I didn't realize we would have to beg so much for re-fills and correct food. My son enjoyed it, and at the end of the day that was what was important, however next year I'll talk him into something else!!~~#~0
This isnt food~~#~0
If you are gluten free, BEWARE!  Do not be fooled by the gluten free menu.  There have been a number of gluten free diners who have gotten ill after eating here, and at least two (that I know of) who believe they have been served gluten after ordering gluten free.  If a restaurant is going to offer a gluten free menu, then they need to ensure that their staff is trained.  They need to show clear evidence of cross contamination procedures.  Our family used to eat here regularly and we finally gave up.  It wasn't safe for us.   We now eat at Tott's, which doesn't have a gf menu, but has been very accommodating.~~#~0
I find these 5 star reviews to be incredibly suspicious. We just got back from returning our ***70 dollar take-out order*** (which consisted of 2 gnocchi, 1 bolognese, and 1 linguini and clam sauce, by the way) to a very rude and egotistical owner. We called beforehand to merely voice our concerns about this incredibly expensive, yet mediocre meal. The owner answered the phone and was not only unconcerned, but was very argumentative, saying that he "only gets a complaint once every 2 months" and that he has a "packed house." He made us feel like our opinions didn't matter in the least bit. He begrudgingly told us to bring our food back for a refund, so we did just that. When we arrived, he met us outside and argued with us a bit more, emphasizing that his 20 seat restaurant was full. When we tried to explain our concerns with the food, he said "whatever" and left, shortly returning with our refund.Food:-Clam and fettuccine-far too salty-Tomato sauce- tastes like canned-Gnocchi-mushy, no texture-Bolognese-no flavorBottom line:-Rude, arrogant owner-Bland,over-priced food-Never returning!!I really didn't want to have to write this review, since I live in the neighborhood and want this place to be good. Before it appeared on Food Network, although expensive, this place was quite good. I just don't want anyone else to waste their time and money when there are so many other good Italian restaurants to eat in Phoenix. (e.g. Aiello's)~~#~0
Atrocious. Consider the price point. Dollar for dollar, dining out just can't get any worse than this. Grease laden, obscenely over salted franchise food for twice the amount of money of your standard franchise restaurant.  The service? Poorly trained staff that has no idea what to do if a customer can't stomach the glop that just came out of the kitchen. Why are bread plates on the table if you don't serve bread with the meal. How on earth do you get off charging $7.50 for a short shot of Jack, $6.25 for fake Guinness, and $8.50 for diluted Citron. This place offers nothing to get me back in there again. It is awful and expensive. Oh, and one last suggestion to our server last night. If any part of a dinner entree is categorically inedible, take the WHOLE plate back to the kitchen and let the cook try to repair it. Don't break up the dish onto those little unusable bread plates and don't return with the same crap that you left with.~~#~0
I have been to three Arriba's locations. The original in Phoenix on Camelback, the one in Scottsdale near FLW and this one in Gilbert. The Phoenix location has always been GREAT in all areas, food, service, etc! I have been there so many times I couldn't even guess as to how many, in fact they should give me a life time supply of roasted chilies. When they opened the Scottsdale location I was surprised that the quality and flavor was the same, and really I have no complaints there either. However the Gilbert location is just bad, and I have given them a fair number of chances and it just seems to get worse.  General repeating themes...1.  The hostesses are not welcoming, Granted I don't expect them to wash my feet or anything, but at least act like i'm not interrupting your day.  2. I won't say all, but at least a good portion of the wait staff seem to have real issues getting orders correct. Not sure what is going on there maybe it's the kitchen, either way it is frustrating. Especially when they act like it's you...On one of my last visits the manager was actually arguing with another customer about the fact that her drink glass was soapy. Why argue? Apologize and make it right.3. The quality of the food here is definitely not on par with the other locations I have been to. Since the Chili Verde has always been one of my favorites I will pick on it...There is just something wrong with the way they make it at this location...Personally I think it is too much thickener, flour or cornstarch. The second time I encountered this I tried to fix it on my own by asking for a side of Hatch chili's instead of the default Jalapeño topper. That helped a bit, but the pasty undertone was still there. In the end what finally killed it for me going to this location was the last couple of times I was there the rice was just the worst. It was just mushy flavorless paste colored with a little tomato sauce. When I mentioned it I was told this is how it has always been??? Uh NO it has not!4. The last item is admittedly nit picky and that is they don't bring out the hot salsa by default. They just bring the bean dip and mild salsa. Well I can excuse this as long as when I ask you bring it...No sense in wasting salsa that the local folks don't want. Bottom line...If you have a successful restaurant and start opening more locations, the first thing you better accept is that food consistency between locations is a must. Even the little things like what salsa to expect with your chips makes a difference, and when you have bigger problems the little things just add fuel to the fire. I hope Arriba's head office sees these posts and cracks the whip at this location! I love the other locations and would really like to be able to visit one close to home...~~#~0
I have been shopping here for 25 years but no more - because of the incident there today. I bought what was labeled as tempera paint (and the label clearly states it washes off with soap and water) for a sidewalk/street painting project for a Festival and the product is clearly misrepresented.  I scrubbed for two hours with a push broom and soapy water to try to remove the so called tempera paint with absolutely no success with a couple of the colors - and partial success with a couple of others.  The Streets and Transportation Dept. finally had to come paint over it.  When I tried to take the paint back with my complaint I was basically told that oh, this is a high quality tempera paint that is made to last.  So why does the label say it washes off with soapy water?  They tried to imply it would not come off because of the unusual surface, but then went on to say it is meant to stick to anything and stay there because it is high quality tempera.  I asked what the difference was then between the tempera they are selling and acrylic paint and could get no good answer (oh, we can call the manufacturer and ask what is in it!).  I have always been a bit irked by their so called discounts for Artlink members, when in reality whenever you ask for a discount you are invariably told the item is already on sale, therefore not eligible for a discount.  From now on I will be taking my business to Jerry's Artarama, even though it is all the way over in Tempe.~~#~0

An average review that wont sway the scales is in order. I took my mom here for mothers day a couple of years ago and had an absolutely awful experience, which embarrased me beyond belief. The bag boys were rude, the pro shop was unjustly impatient, the snack bar was closed (they said it would be open,) and the drink cart did not come by one time during our entire round. We even called the pro shop from cell phones to complain on about the 12th hole saying there was no water in the drinking water jugs on the course, the cart girl had never come by, and the bathrooms were all locked and the cart key did not open them. The guys in the shop were apologetic, and said they would send someone right out to help us, but we didn't see anyone. On the 14th hole, the ranger came by and he had some towels which kept us cool, and we let him know how disappointed we were that the drink cart wasn't coming by, the snack bar was closed, and there was no water in the drinking water jugs. Basically that we could not get water, and it was 100 degrees outside! He apologized profusely and said he would see us on the next hole with waters and bathroom keys, but we never did see him the rest of the round.When we got back to the clubhouse, the bag boy was sitting on a chair under an umbrella watching us take the bags off the cart and stare him down. I'm sure he realized we were pissed he wasn't doing his job, but he offered no apologies or assistance. I later told someone in the pro shop about all the problems we had and he basically told us that we should expect this in the summertime. I've played golf for 20 years in Arizona, and most of it in the summer because I can actually afford to play then, and never had such an awful experience. I felt like I was playing on a closed golf course. A letter to their director of golf Joe Shershanova got a written apology and a comp round, but it didn't make up a ruined mothers day that I spent a lot of my hard earned money on... I don't make much.The second experience was average.~~#~0
Service- badQuality of food- ehhhPrice- WHAT THE ??!!!Luckily, I didn't have to foot the bill for this place because it was just bad bad bad. This review was mostly from the sushi bar.Ordered edemame, iced green tea, spicy tuna, las vegas roll and caterpillar roll. I had to stay with these very conventional rolls because honestly, I was scared to venture in uncharted territory at this place.Everything tasted worse than grocery store sushi.. And the Las Vegas roll was deep fried and way too crispy.Another gripe- most sushi places have affable sushi chefs- not the ones at Ichi Ban. They are rude, and look annoyed when you place an order. Our waitress also took 15 minutes to even ask us about our drink orders.. in fact, I had to ask her to take our drink orders. Overall- don't waste your time at this place.~~#~0
In the words of the prophet, Chuck D, "Don't believe the hype!" I have never paid so much and been so disappointed...well, there was that one time, at band camp...no, it was San Diego...but I digress. Cupcakes are supposed to be little chunks of heaven.  Hand-held joy.  A party in your palm!  No such joy was found at Sprinkles.  Although the storefront is much more aesthetically pleasing than the two-pump gas station, manned by the creepy guy with a limp, that once inhabited the NEC of Camelback & Scottsdale road, Sprinkles was the exemplification of Cupcake FAIL.  Despite a cupcake's inherent divine existence, this fun-sized pastry is not the brain surgery of baked goods.  Remember back in grade school when it was some kid's birthday and his mom would bring in an armful of the pastel frosted lovelies to share with the whole class?  In the good ol' days before everyone had food allergies and gluten-intolerance, the cupcakes would have even been homemade--some a little bigger, some a little smaller, with frosting smeared unevenly across the top.  Ah...the bliss of the cupcake.  It all disintegrated into pure chaos after the sugar high wore off, but for 8 shining minutes on some kid's birthday, every child in your classroom was friends and was happy.  A good cupcake and the joy it can deliver is really not that hard to achieve. Is it too much to expect to be transported to those euphoric moments of childhood when I bite into the cupcake I paid $3.50 for?  I say, No!  How Candace Nelson, founder of Sprinkles, has managed to take the nation by storm and crush the dreams of so many other cupcake-makers on the Food Network's Cupcake Wars is completely beyond me.  My newest theory is that she judges the hopeful contestants so harshly because she knows she can't handle the competition.  Maybe the guy who "hosts" the show is her part-time lover.  They hold up in their love nest baking sub-par cupcakes and come up with not-so witty catch phrases for him to use on the show.  Again, I digress. Now to the dissection:1.       The cake, the foundation upon which the greatness of all cupcakes is built, was dry and flavorless.  When you tell me "dark chocolate" or "chocolate chocolate chip," I should not have to wonder by the second bite if they really used chocolate or that carob mess that dieters use to keep from cutting their wrists when they're jonesing for a chocolate fix.  Maybe a marble-sized piece in the very middle of the cake was slightly moist, but if you're gonna charge me the other side of 5 bucks for a piece of cake in the desert, buy a damn humidifier.2.       The amount of frosting varied from one cupcake to another.  The only flavor of frosting that was particularly good was the raspberry and there was two-thirds less of it compared to the other flavors.3.       What the hell are those things they stick on top?  Is it a button?  Is it even edible?  What the hell is your scrapbooking doodad doing on my cupcake?4.       I feel it is my duty to warn the inhabitants of Atlanta, who will soon have a Sprinkles location of their very own, that the Red Velvet cupcake is far from the tried and true slice of southern comfort bearing the same name.  It's really Red Velvet sacrilege. Next time I want a cupcake, I'll make it my damn self out of boxed cake mix and jar of frosting.  Or, even better!  I'll skip the baking aisle all together and hit the grocery store bakery for a dozen assembly line-made, airbrushed for color, and sprinkled with itty-bitty Necco wafer cupcakes and pay three times less for the privilege.~~#~0
Bad choice for a Saturday lunch.  For some reason, we were seated in the bar. No big deal I guess. Server  was not friendly about how she informed us that the cheaper priced margaritas were a pre mix....we wanted a margarita but it was just the way it was presented that made us stick to water. It took forever to get our food. One burrito and a grilled chicken salad. I'm pretty sure she forgot to turn our order in. The part that really ticked me off is that she made no mention of the delta until she brought the check. Service was lousy. I also blame their management for poor training. Food was ok.... Too many Mexican food choices to say that I will be back.~~#~0
Bank of Wasting My Time is what their name should be changed to. I recently opened an account online with Bank of America. After nearly completing the application, my computer timed out. I didn't want to resubmit the application and have my credit pulled again, so I called their online technical support to see if they could verify that my account application had been received. But due to their crappy system restrictions, I was told that I would need to wait three hours before they could tell me if the application had been completed or not. The following day, I received an email stating that my account application had been approved, and documentation would be sent to me that I would need to return. I don't live at the physical address provided (in the process of moving), and they wouldn't accept a PO BOX, so I wasn't able to pick up the paperwork until about a week later. Going through all of the mail items (5 separate pieces of mail!), I found the signature card letter, debit card, debit card instructions, debit card pin number, and then a letter stating that the entire account had been closed. I called customer service to find out why the account had been closed, and the girl on the phone (who sounded like she had marbles in her mouth and was incapable of properly reading the script that was no-doubt right in front of her) told me that the account was in the process of being closed and nothing could be done. I asked why the account was being closed, and she told me that it was due to suspicious activity. I asked her to tell me what the suspicious activity was, considering I hadn't even signed the paperwork for the account yet, and there wasn't any money in the account. She told me that it was suspicious I hadn't returned the paperwork right away. It had only been a week since the application had been submitted online, and somehow that was suspicious??? I asked to speak with a manager, and have currently been holding for 50 minutes. Unless you have buckets of time to waste with this financial disaster, DO NOT open an account with Bank of America.~~#~0
No bueno.  We read about this restaurant in one of the Moon's AZ books as a place to try for good, New Mexican food = not.  It was worse then Chevy's...the margaritas tasted like water and I got so sick during dinner from the food & margarita I was donzo for the night.Also, you're definitely not coming for the ambiance, it's definitely a hole of wall.  It would've been fine if the food made up for it - but you're better off at a chain restaurant down the street.~~#~0
If I could give you NO stars I would. I went there on a thursday night at 9:15pm.  The tables were full but there were 5 seats at the bar. The hostess (manager) told me that it would be a 15min wait for the bar, seriously? there are five seats open! She then said that she had people waiting for the bar. Well, there was no one waiting and no one in the house next door. The problem is that people think it is OK to wait 3 hours for OK pizza and be rushed to finish because the media praises this place.There are many places in Phoenix that are better (Cibo) without the Hostess attitude. Your a pizza place not the French Laundry! And yes I have had the pizza, on 3 different occasions and it's not THAT good.  If you spent more time training your staff on customer service you might be able to open another location but my guess is that your afraid to.~~#~0
Please people, wise-up.  These Sandwiches are awful.  Cheap Italian cold cuts on a big hotdog roll do not make a Sub sandwich.  First, the meats are pre-sliced and of very poor quality. The vegatables have been in the bin too long with brown bits in the lettuce and tomatoes that were sliced while George W. was still prez.  And people, that is a hotdog roll, not a sub roll.  No structure, no body.  Look at the pretty signs over the counter, now look at the sandwich that you are about to eat.  Do they look the same?  Well, you got what you paid for, and you didn't pay much.  I swear, some people eat for the fuel, not for the taste or quality of what they shove down thier cakehole.~~#~0
Pane Bianco:  Stuck in a Rut.I've had all the sandwiches about 50 times each.Dump the Sopprasata please - time for a change.Bring back more of the Meatballs / Sausage and other bitchin Markets.~~#~0
Unfortunately, the trip to India gate restaurant in chandler was a waste of time. The only good thing was that we had a buy one get one free coupon. The staff stood at the bar and stared the entire meal. They even brought us items off of the buffet... and we didn't order the buffet. i expected my food to be freshly prepared... all of it. even the naan. Maybe we hit them on a bad night. None-the-less, we wont be back.~~#~0
Not a fan. I scraped a cornea and came in with a towel over my eyes to block the light. The receptionist made not one, not two, but THREE inappropriate jokes to my fiancee about beating me up. Then my prescriptions were wrong - one for hydrocodone, which I specifically asked them NOT to give me because it makes me nauseaous, and one for some kind of antibiotic that my regular doctor disposed of immediately and re-prescribed me something that might actually work.~~#~0
First off, I'd like to mention that I've been in the salon industry for years, both in Los Angeles where I ran one of the best salons in the city for years, and here in Phoenix, where I helped a friend build another from the ground up. I've seen the good, the bad, and the ugly. This place, unfortunately, exists in the final group.The service was horrendous. The place appears to be run by a mother and daughter duo, who I can only assume had this project funded by "Daddy dearest," something evident in the lack of pride which went into the design and running of the place. The overall decor is tacky at best, with little care given to any of the details that separate a Salon from a Great Clips.The product wasn't much better. The blow out I received was mediocre at best, especially compared to similar offerings in the area. The cost was standard, but definitely not worth the quality.I won't be returning.~~#~0
I was so excited to revisit the Swensens of old but this was definitely not the same. We waited quite a bit before we were attended to even though there were only 3 tables occupied. The woman who waited on us looked miserable and was definitely not friendly. The chicken sandwich was ok but the hamburger tasted as though it had been in the freezer for years. I mentioned this to the waitress and she seemed perplexed. I explained that I did not like the taste and she argued with me and insisted there was nothing wrong with it. I never experienced this treatment from an owner (we later found out).  Please someone give her a clue regarding  customer service and food quality.~~#~0
Horrible customer service. The waitress was very indifferent and could care less about serving us though they were not very busy. Had to flag her down to order. The food did come quickly, but then I had to flag her down to for the check, and then finally to pay. Craziness!The food was so-so. The coconut milk soup was too strong, and the spicy basil leaf wasn't very good either. The Pa-nang was good.~~#~0
Stopped by to try the tsoynamis and it was great until I got half way through and found a small hair in it! Grossed me out!!!~~#~0
Very bad. I won't be back. The first sign was there were no Asians eating there. Should have been a clue. Having lived in several Asian countries for many years I know what authentic Thai food is. This isn't it.~~#~0
If there are gay bars out there, this is most definitely a straight bar and included a young Peggy Bundy look alike and far too many frighteningly tall bald men with a love of nu-metal.  I typically choose to hang out in a lot of extremely neutral spaces; I'm far more comfortable in these environments.  Generally I require a dark divey place, or something similar to Lost Leaf.  There's nothing more comforting than a spot that essentially possesses a coffee shop vibe that happens to be open late and serve beer.Note that I was here for a few hours completely sober.  It should also be noted that I was driving, yet not comfortable enough to seriously consider having a drink regardless.  I'm a high anxiety sort of kid and between the other patrons, bad feng shui, and bar stools from hell, I was rather on edge.  The bartenders were adorable, however, and seemed to make their rounds in decent intervals.Nathan and I sat on the patio at the end of the evening and debated between whether this was a 1 or 2-star establishment.  My opinion was fairly solid; we'll see what he has to say.  The sheer number of McCain-Palin bumper stickers in the parking lot did most of the talking.Is it fair to rate something with a single star for being "not my type of place"?  Probably not.  I've made concessions for that in the past, but I felt so awkward here that it seems warranted.I make it a point of pride to patron places with the name "Big [Insert Male Name Here]" as little as possible, particularly if they're misspelled.  Big Nixx will be no exception.  What can I say?  I'm a total snob.~~#~0
Go for the ambiance and not the food. I recommend only the margaritas and the kids menu. The food was virtually inedible. Mahi mahi and pork tasted like they were left out on the windowsill overnight. For a Saturday night during spring break and spring training, the Place was half filled with tourists and locals with no taste buds. Go at your own risk.~~#~0
Absolutely ridiculous how rude the staff is. I frequently stop by around early evenings because it's conveniently located on my way home from work. Big fan of Wendy's and their food, needs to improve greatly on the quality of employees.~~#~0
This place has absolutely no soul. It's that sterile museum-like type of place where you feel like you can't touch anything. Not the kind of environment for a coffee house in what used to be a pillar to the Phoenix Art and Music Scene. I don't care how dingy and mismanaged the former Willow House became. When it came down to it, it was still one of the best things Phoenix had to offer it's counter-cultural artsy citizens. The former Willow House may not have been as spruced up as a place Hob Nobs is today, but the food was better, the service was more genuine, and the events there were fantastic. Poets had their own night, Musicians had their own open mic that drew in some of the best local talent Phoenix has today, and so on...Now...it's all just a fading memory. Simply put, Hob Nobs has inferior baristas, the art is disgustingly main-stream/mass-market looking, and the live music they have there is so bad, Starbucks wouldn't even play it. Their prices are too high for mediocre food, and don't even get me started on their baked goods. To the people who think the art is gorgeous... have you never walked into ANY of the dozens of REAL art galleries in Phoenix? Also, I'm no interior designer, but leather seats and high wooden pub tables in one room and chrome and glass w/ a flat-screen TV in another doesn't seem like the place I'd like to be in. One star for the bathroom upgrade, but I guess it doesn't matter since they shit all over the place anyway.PS. I'm not just saying all of this as a blind Willow House loyalist-- if you look through my reviews, I frequent most of the coffee shops all around town and this one is just a huge rip-off.OH, and they have permission to sell beer now...which is probably because their coffee sucks so bad, no reasonable sober person could possibly want any.~~#~0
THIS PLACE HAS THE WORST SERVICE EVER. I used to love going here when they first opened but something has gone terribly wrong. They were out of 2 of the 3 menu items we tried to order, which we were informed of nearly 20 minutes after putting our order in. When we finally did get our food, half of it came. Eventually we did get the other half, after those who got their food were finished. The quality of the food was awful. The server forgot the second round twice. We had to go up to the bar and wait about 15 minutes for someone to acknowledge us to give us our tab. At the bar there were other people complaining about the poor service. Needless to say I am never going back; which is a shame because this could be a really great place.~~#~0
They're getting better at separating bills and not having mysterious drinks appear on your own tab.if Jasmine didn't work there, i'd have no reason to go to this location anymore.i was told to stop giving hot chicks piggy back rides. seriously?no redbull? wtf!?!?!~~#~0
After reading the other Yelp reviews we decided to give them a try.  I made the mistake of taking all of our dry cleaning instead of just taking a few things as trial run.  My wife had 3 expensive cardigans that all came back faded and pilly.  My wife had spilled on an expensive dress at a wedding we attended, and when I dropped off the dress the women was very nice and placed tape on the stain.  Unfortunately, the stain was still there when we got everything back.  All in all, with my wife's delicate dry cleaning it was a very poor experience.I have to go back tomorrow to pick up my dress shirts.  Hopefully they will turn out better.~~#~0
One of the worst meals ever.  Service was bad, food was bad.  Never going back.~~#~0
Generally, I do not write reviews after visiting a place one time, but this placed forced an exception.  My wife and I were heading to a movie at the Harkins theatre next door and wanted a bite to eat before the flick started - so we popped into one of the nearest restaurants Ono Hawaiian BBQ (we talked about Rubio's but decided to try something new).  Believe me when I tell you it is not very often that I can not eat the food I have in front of me at dinner time - but this was one of those times (more on that below).The service at this place was not particularly helpful, but we finally were able to place our order after their employee got off the phone.  Several items were out on their menu and two other items had black magic marker on their sign indicating they were permanently out (I understand changing menus, but this did not look particularly professional).Once we ordered, we choose to sit at one of their high top tables or at least tried to.  The first one we sat at was dirty so we moved to the second one but then realized that was dirty too (this is in a restaurant with only one table occupied  - should not have have been too busy to keep the place clean.  Ditto for the third and fourth high top we tried.  So we moved to some round tables on the other side of the restaurant - two of the three were dirty there too and the third was in direct sunshine (can't blame the restaurant for the sun).  We did finally find a table with no crumbs, sauce smears or food left on it and sat down.  As we were eating one of the employees came out and cleaned one table, got a phone call and never came out for any of the others.I ordered the seafood noodle soup and my wife ordered some spare ribs.  The seafood was not fresh, smelled unpleasant and two of the shrimp in it had not be deveined (not appetizing and I was unable to eat given the smell and the appearance).  The same was true of my wife's food - it smelled bad, tasted bad and did not look good.  We would have talked to the manager but at this point no one was around (they were all in the back in the kitchen) and it was not clear any of the people there were management level anyway.  As I said above, it is pretty rare that I can not even choke down a meal - but we tossed it in the garbage and left (ended up having a bag of popcorn at the movies for dinner).Just because I am on a roll I will also mention that their shaved ice counter was not open - no big deal but it would have been nice if they had not left brooms and mops as well as boxes sitting out in their restaurant.All -in-all, bad food, inattentive service, unpleasant smells and a dirty unprofessional looking restaurant combined for a wasted $18 of food.  Perhaps we just hit a really bad night for the restaurant, but I know I will not be back. I~~#~0
went back there today and asked for two simple burgers with nothing but ketchup and cheese, not hard, right? apparently it is if your english is as good as your order taking skills~~#~0
This is a rip off right now. Online shows $22 rate, they sneak in a gps fee, and add small range balls your rate ends up being $37 with the worst greens in the valley. You can play far better high end courses for cheaper in the summer. Stay away.  The only way to describe this course is that it is Over Designed~~#~0
Wouldn't you think a company in the communications business could communicate? Pretty simple, right? Well it's not really true for Cox.I arrived at the store to pickup a box I had ordered over the phone the night before, seemingly a pretty simple task. I was fourth in line and two people were at the counters waiting on customers. Not too bad, or so I thought.After about a 15 minute wait it's my turn, or so I thought, but I'm never called and one of the two people waiting on customers is now busy working at her station on some other problem. No communication with the customers waiting which has now swelled to about 10-12. Finally she puts her phone on speaker and it sounds as though she's waiting for Cox technical assistance. Wouldn't it make sense for employees to have a direct line to technical support? Just sayin! All this time the second customer service rep is waiting on a customer who has come to the store to ask 500 questions and set-up new service at their home. All of this is taking a V-E-R-Y L-O-N-G T-I-M-E.Finally the CSR that has been on hold with tech support gives up and hangs up, but she still doesn't wait on anyone. After about an hour wait the second CSR is done with the new setup and calls my name, all of the people in the waiting area cheer and I tell them I'll try to make it quick. 10 minutes later I'm out the door. Not so bad except for the 1 hour wait.I would have hated to have been one of the 20 people in line at this point. Hopefully they're not still in the store.If they had just let the people waiting know what was going on it would have made the wait much more bearable. Couldn't they have called someone from the back to help? Yes, there were other people in the building. But they never did any of this! It's all about communication folks!~~#~0
Not Impressed.  Music way to loud - server was an order taker ....People smoking on the patio (Gross) after waiting for 10 minutes for the Ice Tea we ordered, having smoke drift into my lunges and then struggling to hear the person I was sitting with -- we got up and left.  Yes, it looks charming BUT there is something off about this place.  We wont be back.~~#~0
Front desk: First impression: Not so good. The lady who checked us in could've at least put a smile on her face or pretend she was happy. It did not give me a good vibe of the staff. I had a few questions with the location and where to find restaurants and she could've given me a map, but didn't. She gave me street names as if I were suppose to know where it is right off the back. Our hotel room was nice but with a terrible view of an abandoned building. No one wants to be looking out a window at an abandoned building. Comes 8:45pm and we get a knock on the door of a NOISE COMPLAINT. Ok, first of all, there were only three of us in the room. We had music coming from our PHONES not even the radio they had in the room. And that was a NOISE complaint? Really? At least what they could've done was tell the people who are complaining that it's still early and if it goes on after 11pm, then they can come and tell us something, but seriously, that early and a Friday night? That did it for me right there. I'm never coming back to this hotel. The service is terrible.Location sucks too. Only good thing is it's next to the light rail. Other than that, no good restaurants nearby. I would the extra bucks to stay elsewhere.~~#~0
Perk overshoots right past Perkiness and straight into impertinence...So I hate to be the bearer of bad news when all the other reviews for this place are good, but honestly I had such an attrocious time that I have to balance the scales here a bit.Perk is right down the street from me and has been open about 8 months. We finally tried it this morning. I am going to have a hard time being convinced to go back.We started with high hopes that immediately got dashed at the door. Although the restaurant was about one third empty the hostess had a bit of hesitancy seating us and then put us at the one table directly in the traffic route to the bathroom. I asked to be seated citing the traffic and again she seemed hesitant as to where to put us (any of the other 10 or so empty tables would have been just fine) before seating us near the front door.The waitress came promptly enough for our drink order. J. asked for water to start and I requested coffee.  She came back a few minutes later with 2 waters and no coffee, dropped them off very fast and took off, I assumed to grab the missing coffee...and then the wait began. I started on the water and was a little surprised that it had the distinctive Phoenix tap taste to it. After several minutes of watching the other diners get their coffee refilled J. finally and politely asked if his wife could get the coffee she ordered. The waitress responded with a very tart and sharp "sure" and the coffee I ordered upon walking in was served with our meal.So, at this point I bet you are wondering about the meal...it's pretty hard to screw up bacon and eggs so that is what I usually order my first visit to a breakfast place (and I just plain like bacon and eggs). The plate arrived looking good with half the plate loaded with their signature rosemary potatoes and an english muffin. I opened my english muffin to find it warm but untoasted (yech) and sent it back...again, no apology or sympathy from the waitress, just that same smart "sure". As I was waiting I started on the potatoes to find that the rosemary was non existent and to be honest, at 9:30 in the morning tasted to me like they were cooked much earlier and kept warm. My english muffin at this point came back toasted so that I could enjoy that.At no point did the waitress come back to offer to refill my coffee. Now I don't know about you, but I have certain expectations when I'm spending 10 bucks on breakfast. They're simple but consistent. Bring my coffee promptly. When a mistake is made, acknowledge it and make it right and especially if multiple mistakes, apologize. And, when all of that is not accomplished, don't try to upsell by offering a pancake for dessert.This is truly a bummer because it is the closest real breakfast joint to my house and I was really wanting someone great to come in and earn my business....goodbye bycycling to Sunday morning goodness, I'll just continue to get in the car and drive farther for my Weekend morning fare.~~#~0
What can I say, we went there and the place was empty, wounder how long will they survive in this economy. The cups were so large that it my wife would not even get any Yogurt. I made my purchase and asked for a LID, they didnt have any.. what a joke. Dont waste your time, The topping were awful as well.~~#~0
I have gone to Apollo's on occasion over the years even before they remodeled. I don't live in the immediate vicinity so I only stop in when in the area and the mood strikes.  The crowd can be diverse but generally tame. I had the recent displeasure of stopping in on a Wednesday with two friends visiting from S.F. The crowd was sparse and we sat at the bar. A young 90's slacker looking bar tender came to take our order. We ordered a rum and coke, LI iced tea, and an apple martini. Upon hearing the apple martini the slacker started to belittle my friends order as being REALLY gay and  had an attitude. At first maybe it could be taken as humorous banter but when he came back with the 1st two drinks he continued in the same vein with the comments and put out attitude. After serving the drink he commented that he hoped it was ok because he never made one before(in a condescending tone). Well, the drink sucked and my friend ordered and was served a beer only after the bartender threw the Martini out in a huff. Needless to say we left as soon as we finished our drinks. I was totally embarrassed. My friends certainly got a poor look at the Phoenix gay scene and what I thought was supposed to be a fairly decent bar and not a dive bar. When I paid the tab the ticket said Hippie Boy which I assume is the bartenders nickname. Imagine that, asking for a Martini at a gay bar and being ridiculed for it as being too gay. The thing is had we had gotten good service we would have stayed for a few more of those expensive gay drinks. Well Apollo's will never get my money again.~~#~0
This place took over Carlos Santana's place. Carlos place had reallly good food but was over priced. This place is over priced and the food is under-par and the service sucks! My wife and my step-son and I went there and deceided to try it because it was new and (the choice of a Good place isn't there) we were hoping for a good restaurant  in Tempe mkt. place. I guess we have to keep on looking.My wife had the file megnon and it  and I had the steak. Our boy had the American Cobe burger. She ordered her steak med.,. It came that way but, it had no salt, no pepper and was not the tender steak that you expect when you order this steak. Slightly stringey and a lot of flavor. I ordered the steak med. rare and I got it med. to med. well. By the time I was 3/4 thru it became med. well. We were greated and sat outside, and sat, and sat, and sat.    We orded and got our food 20 min. later and my steak was med. well ( I ordered med rare) and my Wifes steak was as if it came from a discount mkt.,. The best thing we had there was a taste of the American" Cobe "burger that our boy had. The plating was from the "Flinstones"! . There was a HUGE pile of mashed potatoes in the middle of the plate ( a pound or more), and the steakes proped againsted it along with aspargus. My wife was shocked @ the amount of potatoes and the plating! I guess it was to try and fool you into beleiving that the cost of the meal was worth it. We won't be back. Where is Carlose Santana? He was over-priced but it was good.We had a couple of drinks and our boy had a sprite. Around 90 dollars + tip. The tip was 5 dollars because we had 3 or 4 waitresses come by in the hour plus that we waited and at the end of the meal our orig. waitress showed up.~~#~0
Rude old man manager was a total scrooge this holiday season.  Salespeople are too busy pimping nooks to treat customers w respect.  Luckily the cafe workers were lovelyI miss the way this establishment used to b when it opened~~#~0
I went here one time with my co workers and it was horrible!! It smelt really bad and it was completely empty, which freaks me out too.~~#~0
This location sucks balls. One of the guys walked off in the middle of taking my order because I didn't instantly respond with what drink I wanted for my combo. I literally glanced up for a second to see what they had and apparently that inconvenienced him. He handed the order slip to another guy standing next to him and said "Here you finish this order" and walked off. The guy taking over wasn't a doll either. He took my cash, gave me my change and closed the screen door on me without any "thank you" or anything. On to the food... Now, I never really like Pete's to begin with but I'll go because my BF loves it. I think mainly because he grew up eating Pete's, so it has become somewhat a childhood nostalgia. I don't like their fish at all but I find their shrimps decent so that's what I usually get. The shrimps I got here were over battered and overcooked, though. I had to tear off all the edges on them because they were way too hard to chew. Bad food and bad service. I will never come here again. Go to the Mesa one or according to my BF, the "real deal Pete's" on Central in S. Phx.~~#~0
Ate here for lunch. You pay for what you get. The food quality is not that great. A lot of the foods were not replenished in a timely manner. Our server was Tammy. She fail to clear our dishes from our table as we went to get our different course meals. There were dirty cups and silverware on the other tables in our dining area where the people have already left the restaurant. One visit was enough.~~#~0
I wanted so much to like Pei Wei. I did. I went twice, getting different dishes both times. My mom raved about it, so I gave it a shot... and while I can't remember what I ate, I do recall bad stomach pains and not being able to get the taste out of my mouth for some time. And by some time, I mean I went here for dinner both times, didn't feel so hot after dinner... then felt awful the entire next day. I have to do my stomach a favor and not touch this food again.~~#~0
Enjoying Friday out for a steak during Bike week and had the pleasure of dining with the four mice that occupy the patio fireplace. The staff was stunned then entertained by the thought. Management didn't seem to care either. Disgusting~~#~0
I purchased a rosemary focaccia dough from this store.  Following the instructions on the focaccia, including poking holes and allowing dough to rest before baking and after baking, I baked the dough at the appropriate temperature for the recommended time only to find the bread was hardly near ready.  The wrapper suggested 15 minutes at 400 degrees...but at 20 minutes, I pulled the bread out.  Not done...and hardly salvageable since I cooled the bread  for 20 minutes after.Get the instructions right for those of us who trust the instructions, Fresh and Easy.~~#~0
If you are a hunter, get your hunting gear ready because this is the place for you! Devil's Martini North is an excellent Puma and Cougar hunting ground. This desert watering hole attracts these two populations in full force. Watching them interact in their natural habitat can be highly interesting, to say the least.Oh, and although they are in their natural habitat, these species are far from "natural" themselves. It seems as though many of them have had mutations and augmentations due to a disease called "lack of self-confidence". This disease has spread rampantly throughout this 40+ female population, and male hunters of all kinds come to watch.Get my point? Devil's North is worthless. It's located in a North Scottsdale strip mall (near a Safeway nonetheless), sometimes they have a cover (they should pay you to come here) and what really cracks me up is that they have valet parking... yet there is an overabundance of spots since it's in a strip mall!The patrons here are laughable. You know those guys that wear men's shoes with a heel? They come here. And you know those 50+ women who think that they are a "sexier" version of Samantha from Sex and The City? They come here too.There are two visually disgusting occurrences that I unfortunately witnessed here - both perfectly describe the atmosphere. The first was a group of 30+ women, dressed like sleaze balls with obvious plastic surgery enhancements on display, trying to act like strippers on the dancing platform, while their 50+ husbands with orange fake tans sat on the couches nearby watching them. PUKE. The second time, it was about 8pm and the music inside was bumping. No one was on the dance floor. Well, except for two highly intoxicated 20 something girls bumping and grinding on each other while making eyes at the male hunters watching them. DOUBLE PUKE. Some patrons here are so sad that that the people watching isn't even amusing. It's great that they have 2-4-1 drink specials but the drinks aren't anything special. I am embarrassed to admit this, but I have also eaten here as well. Don't do it. The service is average, nothing to write home about. I've waited ages for drinks/food when it's not even that packed.Oh, and this place is so "classy" that you are not allowed to wear a baseball hat inside. Riiiiiight. Yet cougars dressed as whores are allowed to run rampant through this place? Methinks not. Pass on Devil's Martini North. Save yourself from visual torture (unless you are a hunter).~~#~0
Horrible customer service and takes 20 for a pizza that was made wrong!!!!~~#~0
If only they would have put the same amount of time and energy into training the servers, and working on the food itself, as they did on the styling of the restaurant, this place could have been great.  Value is way out of line. $4.50 for ONE below average spring roll. We tried three types and all had only one sliver of the ingredients listed.We were given only  one menu when we were seated, WTF?  Another table near by saw that we had not been helped after about 5-10 minutes and notified the manager who was working the bar, and he didn't do much at just send some kid over to us.Was not given a drink menu until I asked for one AFTER we ordered food. WTF?Summary: Super trendy/hip/stylish place with a least double overpriced food, inexperienced  wait staff, and  management who doesn't have a clue about customer service.~~#~0
Sorry, after 4 days of horrid food poisoning I need to drop them to 1 star... or actually no stars.  I'm confident it was the improperly prepared Cobia that left me hunkered down in the bathroom for nearly a week.  I suggest they stick to fish that is easy to prepare and turns quickly... salmon, tuna, etc...~~#~0
I always believe in second chances so my wife and family decided to try the BJ again after an extremely slow and bland   experience a few months ago.  We arrived this am, are seated and the staff was obviously overwhelmed.  Waited 20 minutes to be acknowledged and our order taken.  Food comes and the special was an apple French Toast, eggs and bacon.  Since when do you put apple cinnamon cream sauce on French toast not o mention undercooked all of the bacon.  Terrible (and I was not the only one at the table thinking it was terrible). Hare to say it, but there will not be another chance.  We tried!~~#~0
I think I'm way too Americanized for this place. It's stinky and filthy. There were unsanitary things every which way I looked. There were these buckets full of veggies soaking in a liquid, i really can't think of any other way to describe it. There were tongs just laying on top of this filthy rusty shelf and I guess you were supposed to grab the liquidy items and put them into a bag? (see pics) This white girl just couldn't handle it. There was some sort of ceiling issue bc there was a lot of drippage. all over their products. see pics. But you can get a crap ton of basil for $1.50.~~#~0
Express indeed! - Express out of here.....Not to say it was fast, but the food had a salty taste.  I like to keep it to a pinch, but I think they used the whole bag here.  I had some hot and sour soup and boy it was sour alright!  I also ordered the House Special CK - and that's when the saltiness hit me like a ton of bricks.  Wowza! The place overall was not appealing to the eye.  I wasn't sure if I'd get sick after eating here, but luckily my immune system is strong enough not to get salt poisoning haha! - Good Luck and Enjoy!~~#~0
Closed, as of this spring.  The replacement restaurant is not worth a visit (unless you are sleeping upstairs, you've driven all day, and cannot face another minute behind the wheel).~~#~0
I wrote this the other day, but here's all I can say... I just went to Discount Tires and they were ten times more honest and helpful.  Just go to Discount Tires.  That's all you need to know. The one on Greenfield & Baseline is great. ----I've written both a good review and a bad review so I can tell you the 100% truth.  Shame on me for thinking I could write these jerks a good review.  So guess what? I've had my tires a little more than a year and only put 15K on them and they're totally SHOT.  When I called to see what I could do about getting prorated ones the man on the phone could not have been more rude.  In fact, I went to a separate Big O Tires store where they were immediately helpful.  Stand by for that review as I'm not totally knocking Big O just this store.  Turns out they gave me the wrong tires and that's why I had so many issues with fuel and my ride hasn't been very smooth.  The other Big O Tire locations says it looks like they just wanted to sell me what they had and my car specifically asks for another kind of tire.  Safety was not the issue, I was never in any danger, but really? You screwed up and you can't even help me so another store has to clean up after you????DO NOT COME TO THIS LOCATION!!!~~#~0
Do not go to this place if you are hungry.  I am very disappointed with this Arcadia Farms.  I have never had such a horrible experience at one location.  Some friends and I went here for breakfast on a Sunday only to find out that they stopped serving breakfast at 11 am.  This doesn't make sense.  We decided that we would stay for  lunch.  I decided to split the California Turkey Club with the potato salad  with a friend.  After 45 minutes later, we finally got our food.  The server did stop to tell us that the kitchen was behind but made no offer if we would like some bread to pass the time.  The California Turkey Club was very disappointing.  It was all bread and nothing in the middle.  Very little turkey on this sandwich.  I wish the server would have said how the potato said was made.  It was covered in mayo which did not sit well with our stomachs.  I have been to Arcadia Farms before for breakfast and had an amazing entree and service.  This time the food and service were really lacking.  We received our bill and noticed that we got charged $3 for splitting our plates.  I did not see this on the menu or  the server did not mention to us when we placed the order.  $3 for a can of Diet Coke?!  Why are you upcharging for a can of soda?  I love supporting local places but this place has lost a customer.~~#~0
This location is now closed.~~#~0
I'm being nice by giving this place one star. Both dishes my table ordered were flavorless, two toned, mediocre breakfast dishes.  The layout of the restaurant is crammed and uninviting.  I was trying to eat while an awkward tween chewed in my ear as she stared at the television beyond me.  I don't plan on going back or recommending this place, ever.~~#~0
Drove 12 miles to eat there. Would not recommend walking across the parking lot. Over cooked and over stirred.  1 cook trying to teach 2 newbies, tried to eat it because I was hungry but could not.~~#~0
We always have enjoyed going to Olive Garden in the past and this experience really changed my opinion of Olive Garden all together. We came here for dinner on a Saturday evening and really were looking forward to having a great experience as always. The bread-sticks are tasty, the salads and soups are always a pleasure to try since they seem to always have new ones coming out from time to time. But my issue is with the management and because of that our experience has tarnished Olive Garden in our eyes. Our server comes over and asks us for drinks. I have a glass of wine and my husband has a Italian margarita. We order our app and  a salad and my husband finishes his margarita and our server asks him if  he would like another. He agrees and asks her to order in another shot of tequila because the first margarita was a little light. She says okay and when she comes back with his margarita following right behind her is the Manager and asks him why he wants an additional shot, he explains and the GM then goes on long explanation on why they cant add additional shots in the drink and said moving forward tonight we are not going to be serving you any more alcoholic drinks. I was shocked! Two drinks and you are cut off. Maybe the manager was having a bad day, or maybe they only let you order two drinks. But this coming from a place where they are always pushing their wine and always go as far to leaving you a whole jug of it at your table this came off as a little odd.  My husband is a good sized man and two drinks and cut off I thought was a little too much. Most importantly this was rude and unprofessional.This ruined our evening and it was very difficult for us to take anything positive from this. Since our order was in we waited for our entrees, ate them, paid the bill and left. I can honestly say that we are never coming back to Olive Garden in the future. I went online the next day and filled in the contact us questionnaire so that we could be contacted by someone at corporate and let someone know how not to treat customers that have been so loyal for so many years now but to this day I have yet to be contacted back, not an email or a call. What a disappointment where customer service goes such a long way. Apparently not to Olive Garden!~~#~0
This place was a sausage fest. There was probably 20 guys for every 1 girl there last time I went. The waitresses were hot, but some of them were kind of old to be wearing the plaid skirt schoolgirl outfits. I probably won't go back, I'd much rather go to bar where I can actually talk to a girl instead of stand around with a bunch of dudes.~~#~0
Is this full service or not? The entire little room of maybe ten tables are clearly viewable by the 3 ladies behind the counter, yet many of us are walking up to get our own refills and pay the check.  They must really be struggling because it must have been in the low 80's in the dining area, and they actually have handwritten lunch & happy hour menus that were xeroxed.I dined well after the lunch hour and it looks like my 2 slice special was from whichever pie was made awhile ago.  Pizza was just ok, mainly for that reason.  Only beer available on tap is Budweiser products.  No craft beer.  Wow just noticed similarity of experience to my last visit a year ago.  Maybe I should give up trying.~~#~0
If you like dated restaurants, with carpet that hasn't been clean in a decade, with an air quality that is stuffy and smelly, with long waits because they don't have enough waiters on the floor, and recipes that use the same 4 ingredients in all their dishes (one of them being LOTS of salt), then Riazzi's is the restaurant for you.~~#~0
I don't understand how this place is still in business. I recently got a online membership here without visiting the gym first, big mistake on my part. Im disgusting to even enter the sauna, how this place is still open to the public is unknown to me. I will be canceling my membership effective tomorrow. I will pay a few more dollars at LA Fitness but well worth the extra bucks...~~#~0
I am honestly shocked by the high reviews of this place. When there are so many fabulous Mexican food restaurants in Arizona, do NOT waste your money here. The pros:1. Neat decor and locationThe cons:1. Chips and salsa for $7.00!!!! Are you kidding me? You get them free at almost every other Mexican food restaurant. That should have been my warning sign.2. The rest of the food was outrageously expensive.  3. The quality of this over-priced food was sub-par at best. I had the fajitas and they were just not good. 4. The bathroom sink was very unique and after taking a few minutes to discover where the water was actually coming from I found that the water was actually passing over BLACK MOLD! This was enough to make me want to vomit since I had washed my hands before eating my not so good fajitas.5. A 20% gratuity was added on our bill. I felt that was a bit presumptuous. 15% is acceptable for a gratuity then let me add more if I want to. 20% is not a given. 6. This is petty, but they spelled "chipotle" wrong on one of their menu items.Overall, I was very disappointed in this place. There are so many great, award winning Mexican food restaurants in Scottsdale alone, why waste your money here? I won't return.~~#~0
I got food poisoning here.  Thank you Quiznos, for helping me drop 7lbs in 12 hours.  Not exaggerating.~~#~0
all flash and no substance.  i had ravioli.  waitress raved about their pasta and how it was homemade.  that may be, but it was also very undercooked.  almost raw. really no getting past something like that.~~#~0
Went there for their buffet lunch with my girlfriend. It was going okay until she got about halfway through her iced tea and then she discovered the cockroach floating not on top of the tea but  deep in. Didn't notice it at first because I guess iced tea is the perfect camo. for these disgusting creatures. We both immediately lost our appetites and they comped half of her meal. That was it. Disgusting place and I will never go back there ever.~~#~0
The website says open Sunday's!! We drove 30 minutes to meet friends here.  Update your website!! You lost our business before we even tried your restaurant.~~#~0
.... this place SUCKS.Customer Service is the worst I've ever experienced in a long time.Food was horrible. My sister's order was spoiled and they served it anyway.Drinks?  As mentioned, the waiter was horrible.  And the manager?  He had no backbone to ensure our waiter was doing what he is paid to do.Aside from the snide comments from lackluster waiter, which was cute - cause I've been called worse, this place isn't a place to dine at. :(~~#~0
Food tastes ok, I ordered a Hawaiian rice bowl w/ brown rice. The bowl consisted of 80% rice, 10% veggies and 10% chicken. Rice was too hard. I don't plan on returning.~~#~0
Ever heard the saying "Jack of all trades, master of none".  Its a donut shop, its a deli, its a cafe, its a family restaurant, its an Asian fast food place...well, we found out differentlyWe were looking for something different for lunch so turned to Yelp and decided to try the "Ninja Bowl".  Then found there is no place with this name.  No street sign, no door marker legend, no mailbox.  Nothing.  We had to do some hunting and asking (I hate asking) and found out the truth.  There are four names on Yelp for the same address and same location:1) Ninja Bowlhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/ninja-bowl-phoenixaka2) Rainbow Donuts Bakery & Cafehttp://www.yelp.com/biz/rainbow-donuts-bakery-and-cafe-phoenixaka3) Rainbow Donuts & Delihttp://www.yelp.com/biz/rainbow-donuts-and-deli-phoenixaka4) Bobby C's Cafehttp://www.yelp.com/biz/bobby-cs-cafe-phoenixAll the same address, phone number and location.  I charged it on my Credit Card and it showed up on my bill as Bobby C's Cafe.Had a terrible time finding it and while I only tried the Sizzling bowl the cost of $8.90 for rice, finely chopped chicken and gluten spicey sauce plus small soda doesn't warrant another visit.~~#~0
This restaurant is closed.  :-(~~#~0
This is my first yelp i have ever done and i am so irritated with dishonest people i had to comment on here. I just went by to check out the gym. The manager was pushy to sell me a membership with a high start up fee and when I said I would have to think about it he asked me why and I told him I wanted to check out other gyms before making my final decision. He went on to tell me the 24 hr was in extremely bad shape and it was closing so don't bother going by there. I thought that was strange so I went to 24hr on my way home to check out their gym and asked if they would be closing soon. their response"have u been to la fitness?"  I guess the scummy salesmen at la fitness think its okay to lie and tell you their competition is shutting down.  it is so common for them to say this that 24hr already knew who was starting the rumor. Well I signed up with 24hr..... They are both older gyms and not the nicest but I would rather go to a gym that is ran by an honest manager.   Do not go to this gym. It's awful and even though it is in a better location for me, it's dishonest and more pricey.~~#~0
Just terrible service, rude and unprofessional.  Pedi polish was done well but  massage, sugar scrub and hot stone massage were done rushed and with an attitude like I was bothering her by being there for service.  Mani was a nightmare.  The gel on both thumb nails crinkled up and looked wrinkly and bumpy.  She tried to "cover up" the error 8x and then refused to do them over again when they still looked awful.  She and the owner kept telling me how pretty they looked, and refused to admit that the nails looked obviously horrible.  Some other nails didn't get the polish evenly applied, and they wouldn't even talk about that either.  They were pointing at me and talking & laughing.  It was so frustrating.  I will not only never go back there, I will be telling everyone I know to stay away.  This place was a very pricey bad nail experience for me.~~#~0
Closed today.  I don't know for how long, maybe out of business?!~~#~0
Oh, blessed Scottsdale. If only ye were as slick as ye has imagined. Therein lies the problem with Barcelona and her patrons.I've long heard this place was THE place to see and be seen in Scottsdale. I knew that wasn't true and had no plans ever to go there. But a birthday party for a fine young man fueled my trip on a Saturday night.Thankfully, we arrived shortly before 10 p.m. --- ahead of many of the plastic millionaires and their shiny chariots. Being the lame, tongue and knuckle dragging fools we are, of course, men had to shell out $10 while women were spared. Once inside, we could see where it was all heading.It's an older crowd at Barcelona than, say, whatever club on Mill Avenue in Tempe. But that's not to say they are grown-ups. In fact, it is a lot more like high school than anything else. The uncool cool people prance around while spiced up oldies make communicating with anything other than hand gestures and swirling hips worthless. The black-suited security guards talking into their sleeves every few seconds also offer a real --- if not short-lived and ultimately comical --- feel that this place is actually hip. In a word: Underwhelming.Make no mistake about it, though, Barcelona is beautifully appointed. Leather chairs and sofas make for comfy private lounges for the lucky (or wealthy) few who occupy them. The sprawling patio is an excellent place on a late summer evening in Arizona. Multiple bars make for relatively speedy service. And the overall gargantuan size of the place makes the crowd seem less, well, crowded.But alas, this is no place for me. By the looks of the joint, it's no place for diners either. Middle-aged partiers with bulging eyeballs and well- yet artificially endowed gold diggers, on the other hand, are apparently welcomed with open arms. Cha, cha, cha.~~#~0
I have been to this bar for happy hour a couple of times after work. They have good Martini specials and they are tasty too! Everything sounds great up to here. So you must be thinking " why would I give this place only 1 Star?" Here is where I draw the line_____________________________- I went last Friday Feb 6th, now when we go for happy hour on Friday night I come straight from work. Since Fridays at my work are casual, I had my casual clothes on (jeans, button up shirt, DC shoes) Myself and about 10 other people were waiting in line to get in, when I got up to the front, I was turned away because, and I quote " You can't wear those type of shoes in here" He then informed me that "Skater shoes aren't allowed". I asked what kind of shoes are allowed? he said anything but "skater shoes" So I said if I had flip flops on that would be ok? he said "yep". So we peaced out of there and I'm never going back. The End~~#~0
I remember when NYPD put out some killer wings and decent pizza.  Ordered 18 Hells Kitchen wings and Da Works pizza.  The pizza was cold and I ended up with 24 wings.  12 were Hells Kitchen and 12 were medium.  Not only were they wrong but the wings were also cold and the hells kitchen were not the same as before.  My bill was 44 bucks for a large pizza and 18 wings.  A bit absurd when the pizza and wings are cold and unsatisfying.  Even if they were warm I can just tell the quality that NYPD is putting out is not the same.  Never again for me.  If I want mediocre pizza and wings I will pay mediocre prices at a different chain.~~#~0
My experience here has been pretty bad. First time I went here I ordered a latte it was so weak that it just tasted like milk. The second time I thought I would just order another shot... I ordered a Vanilla Latte with an Extra shot, what I recieved was a regular latte which was weak again, when I asked for the vanilla I was told that it costs extra and so I said alright I thought thats what i paid for... Gave them an extra dollar for the vanilla and I ended up drinking what tasted like a Vanilla milk.Do yourself a favor and stick to Lola's, Cartel, and Lux. Places that have both atmosphere and knowledge of how to extract a perfect shot.~~#~0
The prices may look good but don't waste your time!  I went to my consult meeting with my wedding planner and was utterly disappointed.  The rep brought only showed me a single petal from 2 different color roses and 2 funeral arrangement books (remember, I was shopping for wedding flowers).  She kept naming off flowers, most of which I wasn't familiar with and didn't know what they looked like and she wouldn't show me pictures.  Instead, my planner showed me pictures from her picture collection.Forty five minutes into the meeting, and most of the arrangements picked out, the rep pushed herself away from the table stating that she didn't think "this would work."  When I asked why, in total shock, she stated that I "should have came knowing exactly what I wanted and that I was looking at my planner too much."   What?!?  I did bring in several pictures of what I liked, in flowers and color.  My planner stepped in and tried to calm the situation but it didn't work.   The rep remained extremely rude and we ended up walking out on the appointment.  If you want any level of customer service, don't go here.  It will be well worth your money to go somewhere with a smile.  We did find another wonderful florist and although we paid a little more, it was well worth it.~~#~0
Oh dear Lord, who the hell picked out the chairs in this place?? The previous reviews I had assumed were from before the recent remodel. So when I read everyone complaining about the chairs I thought "surely they have changed the chairs if people are this unhappy". But alas, they have the same ones everyone had complained about. No lie, they are office computer chairs and cheap ones at that. Sometimes I watch a movie at home in my computer chair, but it is a Cadallic. These however are Daewoo's. The dinner and a movie concept is cool and granted this place is wayyyyy cheaper than other places that do this, but the chairs are so ungodly uncomfortable that the money saved isn't worth it when you have to pay it to your chiropractor later!  Your other option is a leather stadium type seat that looks promising until you sit in it and realize it is hard and does not recline.  *sigh* Spirit deflatedJust stick to your regular routine.... grab a bite before you hit the local Harkins and it's all good.~~#~0
Spent like $30.00 for a couple burgers and left very hungry..all that money and the burgers didn't even come with fries, also..servers were young and never around much..I had to get up twice myself and pour myself more water..they better do better than this charging these kind of prices in this economy.~~#~0
I have been here a few times and had an ok experience. I went this evening and was greeted at the door by a nice girl. We grabbed our yogurt and toppings, when my son took a bite of the brownie before we had weighed it. The man working behind the counter immediately quipped that we are not allowed to eat anything before we weigh it. I apologized and said he just took a bite. The man said he would add .39 to our total because of it. I told him that there was NO way a brownie bite would equate to that. He just stared at me and told me it is policy not to eat anything before it is weighed. I told him I understand the policy and that he is a child and made a mistake. I did not agree with him yelling at my son.Anyways, the yogurt is ok, but not worth the poor attitude of the people that work there. Will not be going back.~~#~0
Because of all of the positive reviews, I wanted to try this place again.  All I can say is WTF is up with all of the positive reviews?  I went last night for HH, and while I did enjoy their $6-all-wines-on-sale happy hour, the food is subpar.  Barely edible, really.  I had the Skewers plate.  Bland, bland, bland.  The chipotle dipping sauce was yummy, but the tzatziki sauce didn't seem to go with any of the skewers all that well.  Plus, the cucumbers in it were not finely diced enough, so it couldn't really be used well as a dip.  Picky, yes, and not worth mentioning if the rest of the meal had been fabulous, but it wasn't...Plus, the place is so blasted loud when it's full.  Enjoyed the ambiance when it was just  a few people, but when it filled up.... sheesh - I was practically screaming across the small table at my friend.  Get some fabric, people!Okay service, but not remarkable.  Sat with an empty water glass for the last 30 minutes or so with no offers to fill it up.What's the big deal, people?~~#~0
Ostensibly to revitalize (er, vitalize) the downtown commerce landscape, the wacky urban park Patriots Square was removed to create this supposed shopping mecca. Looks to me to be yet another in a series of failed, incongruous Phoenix urban development projects that attract the indifferent few to the not interesting. Yawn.~~#~0
Unmitigated Disaster - We will never be back again, and I would have to recommend (after this experience) for no one to go there either.Upon entering the restaurant, we were not so kindly greeted by a white haired woman at the front desk. Our reservation was for 7PM, and we got there at 6:55PM. The disgruntled lady tells us to sit in the lobby until it's closer to 7PM... Since when did showing up a few minutes early become a nuisance? Moving forward, we headed towards the lobby to find eight people also waiting to be seated. A little unusual for a Tuesday night, but no big deal - until twenty minutes passed until we were finally seated. I understand that restaurants can get busy, but a simple "I'm sorry for the wait" would have gone a long way.There were two dining areas and we were placed in the larger room. Several tables were available, so I didn't understand the long wait. Anyway, there's an old-fashioned quality to this place... not good or bad. The chairs were uncomfortable and the carpet looked unkempt, but we were there for the food. We sampled the Duck Tamales.  Unfortunately, there was nothing special about this dish. It wasn't great, but it wasn't horrible either.  That was the highlight of the eveningWhile waiting for the main dishes to arrive, it got extremely cold in the restaurant. We hear the staff complaining about the temperature, and then we see another couple complaining to the host about how cold it was on their side of the room. Finally, dinner arrives... I ordered the wild boar cooked to medium rare. It tasted medium-well to well done. The waiter stated that this dish comes with five large medallions, but looking at the dish, there were thinly shaved bits of meat. This dish reminded me of the over-cooked roast beef that my dad used to make when we were kids (which I hated, by the way). My wife ordered the braised short ribs which tasted like something that came out of a microwave. She tells me, "For the price of this meal, I'd rather eat a microwaveable meal." I tried a piece of the short ribs thinking it couldn't be that bad... WRONG. The short ribs were chewy, stringy, and although it was covered in sauce, it was DRY. We hardly put a dent in our meal. While waiting for our missing waiter, we noticed that the restaurant was starting to get really warm - similar to a gym. We both started laughing at how horrible everything had been. We were finally able to flag down the waiter for our check. He never once asked us how our meal was - even after seeing our plates were more than half full. Anyway, the moral of the story is: Don't waste your money here. Or perhaps call in advance to make sure Vincent is working. While waiting for our car, the valet guy said, "Vincent is on vacation. His food is phenomenal, but when he's not here, we hear customer complaints." Maybe this guy is right, and Vincent's food is out-of-this-world; however, based on the service alone, I will not even bother coming back. No second chances for this place - no thanks!~~#~0
To be fair, we went to Matt's based on the raveswe read on various sources.  Like the emperpr's new clothes, we fail to see what the hubbub is all about. I recently went to breakfast there and order a cheese omelet with home fries and wnet away hungry and very disappointed.  The home fries were mostly uncooked and badly seasoned,  The eggs were hard and disappointing and the toast was hard and cold.  This was very unsatisfactory and it is certain that Matt's Breakfast lives off its laurels and not the food.~~#~0
Do not eat sushi here. The service was good, the bartender was pleasant, but the fish was terrible. We ordered tuna and salmon nigiri which was completely dried out and, in a word, disgusting. I have to assume the other reviews refer to the wok menu, because the sushi was a health code violation waiting to happen.~~#~0
this was an attempt at an old tyme eatery.Pros. They have a nive gift shop.Cons. the food was cold, the servers were less then attentive, the prices were way out of wack. For  chain style restaraunt they should have had it down. Dont expect to see me there again.~~#~0
I was so pissed off.I ordered the Coronado Enchiladas, the special they had last week. They were awful. If I wanted undercooked tortillas with a veggie filling, and taco bell sauce, I could go to Taco Bell. But nontheless, I paid $9.And they did not replace my crap food for free. I ended up paying $17 total for the Mongolian... Which is good, but not $17 good.Make sure that you are going to enjoy what you get, because them not owning up to shitty food is a bad idea.~~#~0
My first visit at this theater was for a movie screening. Thankfully the movie was good so I was able to at least put out of my mind for a little while how bad this theater is. For being in a mall with higher end stores, this theater is so out of place. It is in need of a MAJOR make over. On the other hand, the theater does have very nice staff. Very helpful. Unless, it's for another screening I will not be back. I'll go to AMC theater.~~#~0
This place was an epic failure on their grand opening event on May 17th, and the management and staff did not step up to take responsibility for what was put out in advertising for the event and claimed it was a "misunderstanding".   The "misunderstanding" is that the invitation /advertisement for the grand opening stated "complimentary appetizers" and "complimentary beer and food pairing", yet there was nothing of the sort, and instead we were informed it was a $25 fee for a sampler plate.  Honestly I think if they had advertised it that way instead, the turnout would have been 1/10th of what it was, if even that. For the record,  the facebook invite promo stated "On Thursday, May 17, experience a familiar-meets-fun complimentary beer and food pairing at Praying Monk Restaurant and Bar's Grand Opening Event. ".It wasn't limited to just the facebook invite either, the graphic ad for the event also mentioned ".. complimentary appetizers .."  which can be seen here - http://i45.tinypic.com/wcog1w.jpgand the blurb on AZ Foothills Magazine website stated "Drinks and passed h'orderves from 6-9 p.m.".Advice to management is to step up and take responsibility for what was advertised and not put it off on the customer by telling them it was a misunderstanding.   Thats not the way to run a business, especially at a grand opening where you are meant to shine and impress.~~#~0
YUCK!  No joke, the worst bbq my family and I have had.  We went once, didn't even eat,  left and went to another place. So disappointing!~~#~0
My last trip on Monday the 14th was not very good.  I sat in the bar and just wanted to grab a quick burger and beer.  The bar was pretty empty, even though Monday Night Football was on.  I sat down and after a few minutes the bartender came over and I ordered a Fat Tire.  He tells me that they don't have Fat Tire but they have some other beer and that it tastes JUST LIKE Fat Tire.  I passed on his recommendation and went with a Kilt Lifter - he seemed pissed that I didn't go with his recommendation.  I ordered a burger and he said "you want it cooked medium right?"  Typically I would say thats a little presumptuous but hey its Islands not Morton's.  The burger came out and was maybe mid-rare, closer to rare and was very greasy.  The bartender asked about 10 seconds after he delivered the food if "Everything looks OK".  I said sure it does and he never stopped back to refill my beer, ask if I wanted a water, or ask how the burger was.  He was busy talking to his girlfriend who was also working.  I ate about 1/2 of the burger and asked for the check.  The bartender brought the check and didn't say a word, or ask why I only at about 1/2 of the burger.  Overall a very disappointing experience.~~#~0
Total disappointment. The food was okay but the service was ridiculous.  The only way they stay in business is the captive resort audience. We waited for 30 minutes for a table for dinner during which I counted about 15+ open tables in the restaurant!  The majority of tables were open and still a 30 minute wait and very poor service. Total bummer!~~#~0
28 bucks for 2 beers and 2 cokes.  The food looked so bad, I didn't even attempt it.~~#~0
Nope. Not again. Not after the sign you're selling alcohol. I want to study in a sober environment and the endorsement of alcohol has pretty much made that null and void. I wish them the best... but I won't be back.~~#~0
NO, NO, NO!!!  The Number One rule for a restaurant or any other business has got to be that you don't try to cheat the customer!  I went to the Web site for this place before going there for lunch today, & wrote down what I planned to order, including these items:Plinchik 2pc. $2.49Somsa 2 pc. $2.49What he tried to charge me:Plicnik 2 pc. $3.99     :-OSomsa:  "You have to pay for 4 at $9.99."     :-OI also had an Uzbek Salad & a Lamb Kebab Sandwich.  It doesn't matter how the food was, because trying to cheat the customer on the money is SO NOT OK!!!~~#~0
Bought a groupon now for here. They said they no longer have a contract with groupon and would not honor it. Then when I checked in to yelp there was a coupon for a free drink once again they lady said they wouldnt honor it. Finally the lady gave me 10% off and a free drink. I was happy at that point until the food arrived. The chicken in my salad was delish but quality of the lettuce and the lack of other ingredients made it undesirable. They barely give you anything and they over charge you. Your pretty much paying $8 bucks for lettuce.~~#~0
AWFUL! They sold me used break pads then tried to not return another item. I had to do a chargeback to them on my credit card.~~#~0
If you like authentic Chinese food, this is not for you. If you think Panda Express is authentic, then you'll love this place.Horrible service. Dropped the check to my table before I was done eating. (I've gone there 3 times, and each time this happened. They weren't even busy).~~#~0
I often visit the Scottsdale location and just love it, so I was excited to try the downtown location. I ordered my favorite dish: kung pao mock chicken. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. It wasn't even close to as spicy as it should be and the brown rice was severely undercooked. I will definitely give it another shot, since I love the menu so much, but this particular visit was disappointing.~~#~0
Worst salon ever. Worst customer service. Worst dye job. I had stains and the color bled everywhere. My neighbor was nice enough to fix it for me by dying my hair back to a color close to my natural one. When the stylist (if you can call her that) was putting my color on me she left in the middle to mix more color and left me there for 30 minutes. Half of my head was over processed. I noticed she was also using Safeway Brand aluminum foil (for food not hair. not impressive.). While I sat there processing she went over to where the other stylists were congregating doing their own hair, talking crap about customers, and texting on their phones (not a pretty sight). I will not be going back. I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy.~~#~0
Terrible staff.  food is average.  When you go to watch a game there, if your entire party is not there right at that moment, they dont seat you at all.  they make you wait.  Very odd.  Crummy staff, average food, and the best of all.  I WISH I were joking.  I ordered a basket of french fries and there was a beer bottle cap in the middle of it all.  stay away from this dump.~~#~0
The wave roll was pretty good. The other two rolls weren't. The service was terrible, and I got food poisoning. We won't go back.~~#~0
I don't know why I keep coming back to this place. Ok I know the fries are ridonculous but I've had better service at a funeral home. I seriously had to wait to place my order at the drive thru while the cashier talked to her friend. Diggity dumb. I guess if the only ppl you can find to work there are meth heads then it's expected but seriously worst service ever.~~#~0
decent donuts but horrible coffee....~~#~0
EW don't ever eat dim sum over here.  Food was not fresh at all! I wouldn't be surprised if they just microwave leftovers from the previous day and serve them all over again. Their shrimp balls tasted like poop balls.... okay, so maybe I'm over-exaggerating a little but you get the idea. It actually tasted like effing plastic... EWWWWWA.I say, go right over to Phoenix Palace Buffet across the street and get yourself some edible dim sum. YOU CAN THANK ME LATER! :)~~#~0
If only yelp offered negative star ratings. In need of a new cordless phone I stopped in a local Radio Shack. You would have thought it was crack the way two employees pushed the Philips cordless on me hard saying that is was the cream of the crop, that I would never experience interference between this phone and other signals, yadda, yadda, yadda. I didn't have time to do my usual two months and 12 days of research so I went for it. It turned out to be a terrible purchase. We had the phone a few weeks before hooking it up, immediately experienced problems with...wait for it...interference, and struggled with it for about two weeks before attempting to return it. This time around Mr. and Mrs. Helpful Radio Shack Employee were not so much so, refusing to take it back b/c it was past 30 days. (Did I mention it had only been out of the box two weeks at this point??) Really awful customer service. A plus? Battery chains are a dime a dozen.~~#~0
The best part of staying at this hotel was leaving it. I stayed here 8 interminable nights during a client conference. Each day was greeted by new (and bizarre) service defects. The restaurant opens (but mostly closes) at the convenience of staff. A vacuum never once touched the carpet in my room. Service trays rotted on corridor floors for days. Oh, and if your cell phone breaks and you need to briefly check your voice mail from your room (the property is in the middle of nowhere), they charge you $20 for a 30 second call. (update: to their credit, they did credit me for the calls)I could go on but I have to see my therapist in an effort to recover from my Sheraton Wild Horse Pass Resort. There are lots of great resorts in the Phoenix but this one isn't even in the running and should be avoided at all costs.~~#~0
This place sucks, not my normal car wash, but was in a hurry and needed to wash my car. They did a horrible job for a $20.00 car wash. And I don't think anyone there spoke English. Everything in the shop was overpriced.  Had been here once before, and I could not remember why it had been so long...now I remember. RIP OFF!~~#~0
So this is what mini golf in the Third World looks like!!I took my Dad here to kill a Sunday afternoon in May.  To say this course "has seen better days" isn't fair to the term better days.  This is course is the Road Kill of Miniature Golf.  Apparently the recession is taking its toll on Tempe's Family Fun Park.The grievances?  Torn up (or completely missing) turf, broken obstacles, ants aplenty, dried up fake river beds... and a partridge in a pair tree!  (Actually a pear tree would have been a welcome distraction but no way it survives with this lack of upkeep)I remember going here on a date in the 90s and losing a ball in the water.  Today the only balls getting lost are the batting cage balls, some of which fly through the shoddy safety netting!  (I wish I could make this stuff up)There are plenty of other distractions at this park (arcade games, batting cages, driving range, bumper boats) --- but if the upkeep is as shoddy as the mini golf course, I'd stay far, far away.~~#~0
Will somebody that works here PLEASE call the filibertos on Lindsey and Mckellips and ask them how to make The ARIZONA BURRITO correctly. I really love filli B's but this is freaking ridiculous. The potatoes are hardly cooked, the salsa is watered down and they don't sell a Jr. az like the others. D+++it and now Im craving one just writing this review but I know if i go Ill be disappointed. :(~~#~0
Ummm Best Blowout Bar in the Valley??? I'd like to see statistical proof!  All that glitters is not gold!If you want review, I'll give it to you.  I made an apt for my girlfriends and me about 5 weeks prior to arrival.  We were coming from out of town and wanted to absolutely make sure this would be a done deal.  We purchased a Travelzoo deal for a 'blow-out'.  I made an apt online and received confirmation#.  The day of the apt I received a friendly call from Courtney reminding me of the appt which I confirmed verbally.  Shortly after I hung up, I received an email reminding me of it as well with the location info etc.  I was also prompted to 'confirm appt' again online.  I though what the heck, I'll do it again even though I just spoke with Courtney.  Mind you the email I received had my name on it (you'll need to remember this for the rest of this story).That same afternoon, we get to this 'salon' and are greeted by the very same Courtney and Keith.  Upon check-in we find out that the appts for all 4 of us have actually been cancelled (umm what?).  At this point, we are being told that the owner Melodi H had cancelled all of our appts because there were no names under the reservation.  Right after Courtneyshe tries calling the owner (Melodi) to receive some sort of guidance on her next course of action as we had prepaid our visit with Travelzoo.  She tried calling the owner and finally after several attempts she reached Melodi.   Melodi then did not deny the fact she cancelled our reservation, but wanted to know if we're available 'the next day'?  (ARE YOU SERIOUS?) There's a reason why people make appts!!!  Courtney kept on telling her the fact we have a confirmation number and all, but Melodi didn't wanna hear any of it.  I asked for a solution to this chaos hoping we'll just have to wait instead we were told "sorry, there is nothing we can do for you".  Frustrated we left. Needless to say, I would NEVER recommend nor come back this place.  What kind of a business owner carelessly cancels her customer appts?  There was no solution to HER mistake.  None. If she had any idea about customer service she's be quick to offer a refund or an apology.  Do you think we had any?  It's not about the $20 Melodi, it's about a principle and respect.  Unfortunately, you not only hurt your own business but you make all the rest of us professional business women look like amateurs.  Overall, I now read all the yelp reviews, and came across the one about police being involved with a customer who supposedly didn't pay, yet her credit card was charged as well as the one where the owner of the salon called someone a pig.... That's sad.   I wish I read all these things prior to my appt.   Instead, I will now be filing multiple complaints to the Better Business Bureau as well as the management of the Waterfront Shopping Center.   I feel cheated, lied to and disrespected. I expect a response from the management/owner of the salon bashing me for the above factual statement.  I'd like to hear what I as a customer did wrong by showing up to my appt?~~#~0
Over the last 10 years I have had several misc. home delivery subscriptions with the Arizona Republic (yes I am one of the dinosaurs that still likes to feel the paper in my hand each morning PLUS the COMICS man the COMICS!)The last 2 subscriptions have been met with nothing but billing issues, missed deliveries and missing coupons.I have had 2 negative experiences with the Republic when it comes to cancelling a subscription and still getting billed- which have led me to no longer want home delivery from them ever again. Receiving a refund for this faulty billing requires no less then hours of emails, phone calls, at least 1 hand written snail mail letter, and the promise of your first born as a paper delivery boy. (ok so the last one was a exaggeration but still)When we moved from a home in Gold Canyon in Dec of 2009 we cancelled a month to month subscription until we got settled into our new place (we did not want the paper going wasted)  I was asked what day I wanted the cancellation effective and I told them "immediately." The very next day we stopped getting the paper delivered to our home- However the following month the charge was automatically deducted from our account. After several phone calls I eventually hand wrote a letter and mailed it to the Republic- A month later we got a refund and an apology letter.In November of 2010 I joined Coupon$ense and through their AZ Republic vendor started a new subscription that included 3 Sunday papers each week (plus a W, F and Sat paper) Since I only needed the coupons in the Sunday paper (and they are supposedly gtd to be in only home delivery papers and not those on the rack) I felt trapped into this excessive subscription. The waste eventually got to me and I  left the Coupon$ense program-(another review to come shortly!) I was told by Coupon$ense that I had to cancel my Republic subscription personally separately (even though they were the ones that set it up and never gave me an account number) -Regardless of the fact that I had an email from the Republic with my subscription information (minus an account number) when I called to cancel, my account could not be located.  Finally after 3 different customer service reps-someone was able to locate my account and cancel it.  The next day I got an email confirming that the cancellation had been processed and we stopped getting papers.2 days later the monthly subscription fee was automatically deducted from my bank accountSee the pattern here?My advise- skip the home delivery and take a jog down to QT on Sunday mornings to get those bright colored comics and just check to be sure the paper you pick up as a stack of coupons in it. It will save lots of money and hassle.~~#~0
The staff is so rude words can't even express. If you hate your job that much find a new one dont take it out on your customers.~~#~0
My recommendation, do not go!  Tonight's dinner could possibly be the worst experience at any restaurant ever.  Our server was short with us and seemed to have no time and it wasn't even busy.   The food was pure grease with cheeses and sauce. La Torretta was over priced and the atmosphere was plain and seemed quite dated.  I don't know who might have posted the other positive reviews but I can only guess it's family.~~#~0
I agree  with the comments stating that Luke's has been in a downslide over the past few years.  Also,  Health Inspection Reports are  not good......... Read the specific violations to get your gross-out for the day. www.maricopa.gov - restaurant inspections)I am still searching for the ultimate Italian Beef sandwich.  Can anyone help (er, "Yelp" ) me?~~#~0
For 16 dollars you can get:a) fatb) seafood that appears to have been stolen from a chinese buffetc) obnoxious and slow serviced) the joy of spending your money in a corporate shit hole that doesn't care about your food when you could be at a real restaurante) shameI'm a big fan of going out to eat, and I usually tip well.. but I went because a friend had her birthday there and decided to pretend I was drunk the entire time and tip in seashells. Desperate times, man. Desperate times.~~#~0
Heads up!! Please ANYONE looking for a sales position in fitness that has EXPERIENCE do not waste your time. The GM Blaine Washington fields all of his calls and WILL NOT speak to you or return any of your emails.  THIS is not a place where you would want to waste your time at ...VERY UNPROFESSIONAL...can you imagine how much business this GM is turning away?? ...I had over 20 coworkers from my previous sales job thinking of following me to this gym...DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME, as Mr. Washington has NO TIME FOR good qualified sales people...~~#~0
I contacted Sun Devil to do plumbing work at my business as I had found a prior invoice in our files from this company as well as our Phoenix location had their number as a contact.  The tech came in on a Sunday and let us know that he would need to return when he could turn off the water to do said repairs.  He was scheduled to arrive Monday morning at 9am so we could fix issues before our 10am opening yet I had to call the office at 9:30am only to find out he would not be arriving until about 10am since he did not inform the office of our opening time???  Tech finally arrived at about 10am and wanted to know how I would be paying, he even asked me how much the limit on my corporate credit card was BEFORE giving me an estimate.  He started repairs and when I asked to get his estimate in writing, he proceeded to write an estimate for well over $130 that he originally quoted me verbally. The owner said to stop work immediately and when placing the urinal back onto the wall, it was mysteriously cracked?  Hmmmmmmmmm.........funny that wasn't in my written estimate prior to work being stopped?  Then I was charged $97 for work done, whatever he did in the 15 minutes or so he WAS working and not sitting in my office asking for money.When I contacted the management, they of course, defended their tech.  He never even turned on the water to SEE what the actual problem was in the first place?  Great service I must say......................NOT!!!!  Now my owner is out $97 and we have to replace the entire urinal.  Sun Devil corporate offices has claimed they are not responsible for anything however the urinal wasn't spraying water all over the place prior to their tech working on it, it had a clogged drain only.I feel like the tech took major advantage of me and my lack of plumbing knowledge.  Please make sure to get several written quotes when you are looking for a plumber.  I feel like such an idiot but I have never been in this situation before.  If you choose to use this company, get a written estimate FIRST and do not trust a verbal statement and make sure they warranty all the work done (or not done in this case).~~#~0
So I called to order dinner for four to go.  Was advised that this restaurant "does not do to go orders."  Can anyone believe that in this economy we have a place snooty enough that they don't "do to go orders???"  Lucky for me, there are numerous other steakhouses with equal or better food so no sweat.~~#~0
Grotesque food, vulgar staff, blech.~~#~0
I was so angry when I left this place. I take my tea very seriously! A friend of mine ordered a nice looseleaf white tea, which was okay, I guess. I ordered a "Masala Chai" which seemed very exotic and fancy on the menu, with Cardamom and blah blah. I took one sip and it tasted familiar -- LIKE THE COSTCO CHAI TEA MIX I HAVE AT HOME & AT WORK. I was outraged. I was paying like five dollars for this supposed ~Masala chai. I tried to explain the situation to them and they didn't do anything about it. They said they used a "sweetening mix" with honey, etc. I asked to see it, and they showed me a bucket of light brown powder which looked an awful lot like the chai mix you buy at Costco. I still get angry when I think about this. The girls working there were very standoffish and intimidating. I didn't dare ask for my money back as they wouldn't even look me in the eye. I felt like it was just a waste of time and money. I will NOT be returning and I will be telling everyone about this.~~#~0
What a waste of my money!  I can pan fry a burger at home and it will still taste much better that this place.  To think I spent almost $30 here, makes me angry...I want my money back.My daughter got the Oreo shake which was really good.  But the burger was extremely disappointing.  Don't even get me started at how gross the veggie fries were....YUCK!~~#~0
Not sure who I spoke with, some supposed  manager.  All I needed was to get a pipe cut for a ceiling fan.  This person said they only cut and thread pipe they sell.  Fair enough,  I kindly offered to pay for the service.  All I got was a repeat of what he initially said.  I will now drive to Home Depot every time I need something even though this store is a half mile from my new home.  Great way to lose a brand new homeowner with many needs in the future!~~#~0
The server/bartender stole my cc info. 2 days after using a cc there, my cc company canceled the card due to multiple fraudulent attempted charges around Tempe, Mesa....We looked at the card activity, the card was never physically out of my hands...Except the 1 day at Lucille's. Think about it, when is the only time your cc is ever out of your hands/sight?When the server takes it, walks away for a few minutes, and returns with your bill.The only place I ever used that particular card where it was physically out of my sight, was Lucille's.....2 days later the multiple fraudulent attempted charges began....Luckily my CC company declined every attempt, canceled that card, contacted me, and sent me a new card..........I KNOW IT WAS THAT SERVER/BARTENDER AT LUCILLE'S.The only reason I am not going there to beat the sh*t out of that kid, is because we have begun an investigation ......~~#~0
I had bought two Groupon coupons for this establishment so thought we would give it a try for dinner. I ordered the Kobe beef hamburger and my wife ordered the Angus beef hamburger. The Kobe burger was possibly the worst hamburger I've ever had. The bun was stale, the burger was billed as cooked medium-rare but was well done making it dry, dry, dry. The Angus burger was medium-rare but the bun was stale and both burgers had no flavor. At $14 and $9 respectively they were way over priced.  The only reason I will return to this place is because I have a second coupon. If you want a good hamburger go to Smashburger.~~#~0
Worst ever!!! They are slow and there's no kiosk or even a stamp machine.  They are near a college university and tons of business, so you'd think they'd be better equipped.  I've never had a good experience here and do not intend to go back.  I will drive out of my way to go to a different post office!~~#~0
All I can say is wow!!! To give you some perspective of how much I dislike this place, I am writing this from my phone in the waiting room. For starters I drive up and I am looking at the prices on the signs above. An employee (I am assuming the manager) approaches and asks what I would like. I ask for the exterior wash because my interior is clean. He looks at me like I am the cheapest customer in the world and rolls his eyes at me. I have a Chevrolet Tahoe with nice rims and he explains with much sarcasm in his voice that if I don't do a hand wash he's not buying me new rims. Thanks buddy! That's exactly what I expected, you to pay me $6000 when I got a $6 wash. Long story short the guy was extremely rude. So I walk into the waiting room, the couch and bar stools were full with customers. The only vacant seats are 2 massage chairs in the corner. There is a slot to pay money and receive a massage, but there is no visible sign expressing the requirement to pay to sit in the chairs. After sitting in the chair for about 30 seconds, an extremely loud alarm starts going off throughout the entire building (inside and outside). The same rude employee comes speed walking in, on a mission from god yelling at me to pay or get out of the chairs... ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!! Not only is that completely ridiculous to have chairs armed with alarms, but this guy actually enjoys yelling at people to get out of the chairs.At this point I go straight to my phone to warn the Yelp Community about this horrible employee that only a horrible business would employ. So as I start typing the same employee starts conversing with the guy restocking the refreshments and word for word says " you like that alarm? I put that s#@t on there so mother f*#@ers, can't sit in the chairs unless they pay me". 5 minutes later a little kid, maybe 6 years old has the same thing happen to him. Scared the kid senseless, and the employee didn't mind this one bit. Long story short this man should be fired immediately, I will never go back to the car wash as long as I live regardless of if he is fired or not. Oh ya and my car wash was horrible. My car was still soaking wet when I picked it up. Horrible~~#~0
Ate here twice. Terrible both times. Won't be back.  Strictly a lunch counter for workers who just want to eat and get it over with.~~#~0
The service was horrible! The food was just ok. The waitress order me an extra sushi dish cause she thought we would like it (which is nice)but then we had to pay extra for it!! THEN when paying for our meal the waitress thought she could just help herself to our change!! We were extremely offended!!! A tip is given, you dont just help yourself to someone elses money.... that's called STEALING!!!~~#~0
aaaaaaaaaaack! I just stopped by here for a slice and salad combo. I hadnt been in for a couple years, and man things have changed.first up was the salad. I was so psyched on life when I saw how huge it was! One bite and I quickly knew I wouldnt be eating much more. I got the ceasar salad and the dressing tasted "off", the salad itself was pretty warm. Not a welcoming salad at all. Then came the pizza. The pizza here used to be really good. Not so much anymore. It was all dried out and crusty. I tossed my lunch and am thankful I had an apple squirrled away in the fridge. $8 down the drain.~~#~0
FYI Went there last night-1/22/2010---it was closed---I assume Alberto's is no longer.~~#~0
This review is written with great remorse.  I have been to Carly's a few times and have always liked the experience.  Cool artwork, good ambiance, decent food, good beer selection, decent service,  etc.  However, I went this week and was dissapointed.  It was a Thursday around 6:00 PM and I was expecting an interesting crowd.  However, the place had about 3 or 4 weird dudes scattered about;  it was a near ghost town, one filled with creepy miners.  One patron kept starring at us.  The lighting was not right, several of the overhead lights used to spotlight the artwork were not turned on.  The music was some crappy, old heavy metal.  The two bar tenders seemed nice enough although the vibe they gave off was kind of odd.  The overall feel was that of a cheap hash bar in Amsterdam, one where everyone is way too stoned and paranoid.  Everything seemed more run down than the last time I visited.  Now it's more of a dive bar than a cool place to chill.  I didn't even want to think about eating there although I've had decent food on previous visits.  A dark experience overall.Ohh Carly's, how I used to love you but you've since jumped the shark.  Could the owners be going through hard times?  Was it just a bad night to be there?  I don't know but I won't be visiting again as there are too many interesting places to eat and drink in the Valley.  Best wishes Carly's, and may you find your way.~~#~0
I went here because I had a Groupon.  I've been to several other places for botox before and never had any problems.  Until I came here.  Didn't have to wait long before being taken back to the room by the nurse.  While she was getting everything prepared she commented on how she had just eaten lunch and was tired.  Not what I wanted to hear from someone about to inject my forehead.  Then her cell phone rang and instead of silencing it she picked it up and made her vacation plans while drawing up the botox.  I had to wait until her call was completed, then she began to aggressive stab and inject the botox into six sites on my forehead.  I was appalled at the manner in which it was done.  I'm an RN, and I've had this done many times before, and this is NOT how you inject.  She then took her thumbs and firmly rubbed the spots she had injected as if she were spreading it around.  This is WRONG!!!  Now I'm left with a huge bruise on my forehead.  I'm lucky that it's the worst thing that happened from this visit.  I would never go back, no matter how cheap or how good of a deal it is.~~#~0
This store has set hideous customer service standards! I was lied to about their return policy by an employee and screwed over! They gave me the run around when I asked to speak to a manager...she was conveniently never present and was the "only one who could help me." When giving me the final verdict on my issue, she cowardly had her employees do it for her on the phone (of course not face to face) and could not even call me herself. I highly recommend taking your business to a different pet boutique where quality service matters!~~#~0
Trashy.  Like a giant ghetto dollar store.  poor quality products, sketchy environment, dirty.  Not to mention the drunk elvis impersonator.  This is not a "swap meet" and I'm sorry I wasted my time!~~#~0
If you ever wonder how bad fast food can get, come to Avondale. They've put us off Panda Express indefinitely due to:1.) Incompetent help2.) TERRIBLE food3.) Creating the impression #1 and #2 are what people want, apparently in lieu of food.And yes, we've contacted mgmt.~~#~0
Gah.~~#~0
We had a very bad experience here recently.  My friend arrived separately and parked where the attendant told her to.  He watched her park and wished her well as she went into the restaurant.  While we ate they had her car towed!  Four employees, including the owner, said they told us the car would be towed.  NO ONE said anything to us about the car during lunch.  What possible motivation could we have had to allow the car to be towed?  Cost $108.00 to retrieve car.  It was a very mediocre salad too!. Very small place - during half the lunch, someone was standing four inches from my elbow waiting to get out.  Yuck!  Never going there again.~~#~0
First, let's just just get this out of the way.  I actually really like Rock Bottom.  I have had great experiences at the Desert Ridge location, but I would definitely stay away from their Arrowhead restaurant.Picture this: You walk in awaiting a night of splendor.  You already like Rock Bottom.  For all intents and purposes, the kill has already been made.  You are seated.  Five minutes later, a chrome dome piece of crap waiter comes over (finally) and hovers directly over your table, making you feel slightly uncomfortable.  You contemplate a beer.  After all, it IS a brewery, right?  You present your ID.  Said waiter looks it over and tells you that he cannot accept a vertical ID.  Why, you ask?  Because they said so, that's why.  They only accept horizontal IDs.  The waiter then tells you that he just had to turn down the girl at the next table for the same reason.You stop the manager (a tub of lard in horizontal stripes) and ask why a valid ID that does not expire until the dawn of the next millennium isn't good enough for Rock Bottom.  You are told, in an unbelievably condescending tone, that their corporate policy is more important than what state law says.  One nasty smirk later, and she leaves the table without another word.    Then you notice that the "girl who was denied a drink" is avidly enjoying a beer at the table beside you.  I'm sure it was next to impossible for said waiter to manage BOTH of his tables at the same time, but we eventually got our check.  Good food, shitty service, horrible management.  Stay away from this location (especially if you see Jabba the Hut on shift).~~#~0
This Wal-Mart can be summed up in one word: Dirty. This has to be the oldest Wal-Mart in the Mesa/Phoenix area and you can tell before you even step foot into the store! For starters, the parking lot looks like a 'stop-n-swap' meet where everyone brings their junk and sets it up in the back of their cars. There is trash everywhere and everything is rundown. Then you go into the store and the flooring is old and gross, the lighting is bad and it has a weird smell. If you happen to need something and you can't find another store near by, this Wal-Mart still has great Wal-Mart prices and the people working and shopping there are really nice. BUT! Do not use their self checkouts!! You have been warned! Here's what happened to me: I scanned two items that I kept in the cart so I pushed that "I do not want to bag this item" twice, the scanner was having a really hard time picking up the bar codes so I had to very slowly repeat my waiving motion over the lasers. Any ways, I get to my next item and it's super light so when I put it in the bag it was like "would you like to bag this item" and since it wasn't picking it up, I just hit the "I do not want to bag this item" button again. Well...that was the 3rd item I didn't want to bag so it triggered an alert and I needed a 'Store log in" The attendant was helping someone else so I sat there...and sat...until the guy came and fixed it for me. Then I got to scan my next item (super glue) - I guess super glue is a controlled item because, again, I needed an override. Okay, I finish up checking out and request $100 back...bad idea I come to find out - the machine only gives me half the change in $10s, but it's still making noises like it's trying to get money out to me. I call my helper over and he kicks the machine and it shoots out two $5s...the thing sounds like it's dying...so my helper calls over to a coworker, who comes over and says "Well you've got to kick it, did you kick it yet" So apparently this happens a lot. I think at the thought of being kicked again the machine spits out the rest of my change in $5s, in a mad panic and falls silent. What an experience.~~#~0
I'm updating this to a 1 instead of a 3 because in the two weeks since I got my nails done, they chipped and peeled significantly and I went and got them redone elsewhere.I would also like to state that Jeannie commented on here that she would give me a gift certificate to come back and get my nails done and after I messaged her I never heard back from her.~~#~0
Since moving to Glendale I have rarely encountered rude business owners, especially during economic downtimes. Apparently the owner (or at least who I'm guessing is the owner) of this establishment (stocky bald guy) doesn't care about his customers. We came in with some local med students, and being students we asked for the cashier to split up the bill. He came over apparently upset and made a snide comment. The pizza wasn't even close to Chicago style deep dish, but whatever enjoyment the food might have offered was soured by the poor management. Definitely do not recommend!~~#~0
Awful service! Mediocre food... if it was what I ordered. The beer was OK but nothing great compared to other breweries around town. I really wanted to like this place, sadly disappointed. No one helped us when we walked in (they weren't busy) and our server kept forgetting about us to chat with dudes at the bar. When she messed up on our food she wasn't very graceful about it... and we still had to pay full price. It also took almost two hours, and we didn't make it to the plans we had afterward. It wasn't just our servers that was bad, the bartender was rude and so was another server. Won't go back... the owners really need to step in!~~#~0
Have eaten here a couple of times and have been fairly pleased.  Ate here Saturday November 3rd.  Service okay, but food was cold.  Later, after no other food, stomach problems and out it came.  My impression is that they are so busy they cut corners, with the food and probably with the prep in the kitchen.~~#~0
As a new yelper, I feel the need to span the star spectrum, but I really had a hard time trying to think of a 1.  Then I remembered a little voyage I took last fall, coupon in hand, to Zoe's, which is right between my apartment and work.  The coupon gave me pretty much any menu item with a drink purchase.  Thank God I had that coupon, becuase I would have been pissed if I had actually payed $7.50 for a "spinach quesadilla" which was cream cheese and cooked spinach between two tortillas.  I could have made it better for $.45 at home.  Then I actually went back again to give it a second chance (I had a lot of coupons) and ate a very boring sandwich with cafeteria stlye mashed potatoes.   Maybe this place would be better for non vegetarians....my coworker liked his Greek Chicken plate, (liked, not loved)....it may go up to 2 or 3 stars for carnivores.~~#~0
I was vacationing in AZ with my family and took a large group (10 people) to Mimi's for a late breakfast on a Thursday morning.  We were seated quickly, which was great.  However, that is where the good experience stopped and the trouble began.  Our waitress came to take our order and was very rude.  Apparently it is too much trouble for the waitress to repeat more than once the types of muffins offered and it is also impossible to order eggs without getting the muffin because she was very annoyed with both of these issues.  Then it took over an hour to get our food.  When the food did arrive, it was good, but the service was horrible.  The waitress never gave us a reason why we were waiting so long for our food and each time she came back she was more and more rude to us.  I believe she thought that she was being funny, but she wasn't funny at all, she was just plain rude.  The food itself was good, but not worth the aggrevation or the wait.  I wouldn't recommend this place.~~#~0
I've been a loyal fan of Burrito Bandito  for Nine years, but I'm done now. It really used to be one of my favorite places, back when Steve owned it. I often said  " the only thing this place needs is to serve beer and it would be perfect" .Now with a new owner,  its a bunch of kids jammin out to Slip Knot and Disturbed serving cold, over priced,  flavorless tacos.  RIP B.B.~~#~0
BUYER BEWARE! I went to this florist instead of a big-internet florist for a birthday gift last week.  I looked for someone who was close to where I wanted them delivered and looked at the website prior to investing time, looking at the possibilities of flower arrangements for our Mother.  Sun City  Florists state they are family run and "Because all of our customers are important, our professional staff is dedicated to making your experience a pleasant one. That is why we always go the extra mile to make your floral gift perfect".  Right.I felt they would honor  what is stated on the website to deliver a nice arrangement of flowers for a birthday gift.  I ordered a $43.00 arrangement and paid and a $14.00 delivery fee for a total of $57.00.When we got a call thanking us, mom made note of the arrangement, and she started describing it to me- She told us about the arrangement noting flower types in the arrangement I would NEVER have ordered!  When it didn't sound like the right kind of flowers (big, light-pink carnations which was most of the arrangement) had been sent, we asked her to send us a photograph. There were about  1/2 the amount of flowers that they actually used in the arrangement compared to the photograph online and it was so sloppy looking, I couldn't believe it.  I was horrified that was what they actually sent and couldn't believe they had the gall to charge us $43.00! This arrangement looked like something you could buy at a Safeway store for $9.99.  An ugly arrangement with big, light- pink carnations.When I called them to tell them how unhappy I was they told me that the time-frame for a guarantee was up.  I ordered these flowers on the 19th and they were delivered on the 20th of Oct.  That's less than a week ago and really beside the point. I told them I had photographs to show them how ridiculously off this arrangement was and they stated they had no email for me to send them the photos.  As a small high-end business owner in San Diego I would never treat our clients this Way!!!!!!  Of course the owner wasn't there and hasn't bothered to return a call. If this happened in my business and someone was as unhappy as we are, I would make sure to make it right somehow- I would have rather thrown my money out the window then have Sun City Forists send an ugly, sloppy, cheap looking arrangement to my mother.Shame on them.  They made sure to tell me on the phone they have a good reputation -I don't know how if this is how they treat customers and overcharge for crap at the same time. NEVER AGAIN.~~#~0
Wow. There is a neon sign on the window that reads "Best Thai Food in Town". LIARS! It was literally the most putrid thing I've ever eaten in my life. I walked in and was hit in the face by this really odd stench. A cross between urine, a gym, and rotting chicken would be the best way to describe it. I should've turned around and walked right out. However, some "ethnic" restaurants have an odd smell to them so I decided to forge ahead, past the HUGE fish tank with 3 fish, kids laying on the floor, and tables that look like they haven't been cleaned in a month. There were awards everywhere raving about the cuisine there. Well, I don't know what was wrong with the people presenting these awards because they obviously have no taste buds. Since I ordered my chicken green curry to go ahead of time, I didn't have to wait long (thank baby Jesus). I got home and discovered that the GREEN curry, was somehow red not green (even though it was in fact green curry). Not only that, but there was hardly any vegetables or chicken in it. In fact, it was more liquid than anything.  Just plain 'ol terrible, at best!I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to my worst enemy...~~#~0
Leanna was the photographer at a wedding I was in.  Her assistant was nice, but Leanna came in with a bad attitude.  I felt she was extremely unprofessional.  All of my family noticed how rude she was.  I saw the proofs and they were ok, but I don't think it was worth putting up with her attitude.~~#~0
Ok this place is HIGHLY OVER RATED! I really would pass. The food was mediocre are best, slightly cold when served. Asking for refills on coffee or ice tea was like waiting for Congressional Approval... The menu looks enticing overall, even gives one hope, but seems to fall desperately short of combining what promises to be really good combination of flavors. Unfortunately the service was just as abysmal. Nice people, sweet, like molasses's about the same speed.There are so many great places in the Metro Phoenix/Scottsdale Area.  Don't stop, keep on driving or go to Einstein Bagels next door. You will be much happier.~~#~0
The location is pretty good. There are plenty of games for the kids to play.  BUT, the food was terrible.  I wasn't expecting much, but it didn't even deliver "just ok".  The management needs to step up their game.  There were bad grapes mixed in with good ones.  And the salad looked old.  I know, we took the kids there for the pizza, but not even that was good.  I'd at least give this place two stars, but the employees were lazy and a lot on the rude side.  It's almost as if they were saying, "We know you're still going to bring your kids here because your kids ask for it."  If we had been at an adult restaurant and were treated the way we were here, we would have walked out.~~#~0
What the heck?! My fiance and I eat here weekly, this is my neighborhood Pei-Wei and our experiences have been crazy bad lately! :(Last time my fiance ordered Kung Pao Chicken. It came out with no snow peas. My fiance asked about it and the server says, "yeah, we just ran out of them". No extra peanuts, no "can I substitute something else for you?"...nothing. End of discussion, apparently. Tonight we go in about 7:30pm and my fiance was daydreaming a bit after he received his receipt. The cashier informed him, "you can leave now".  We receive our usual; his Kung Pao Chicken and my lettuce wraps. His Kung Pao noodles were so overcooked they were like chewing paste. My lettuce wraps tasted fine, but two hours later and I was incapacitated with stomach pains. Just finished expunging the remainder of the wraps, and I am starting to feel okay. And no, it could not have been anything else I ate. Or a virus. They don't come and go so quickly. Next time we are craving Pei-Wei, we will be making the drive to the East Phoenix location.~~#~0
This is not about the store it is about Cox via telephone. There was no account for Cox Corporate. We have been trying to get an I Pad to work with the Cox email. To say this is the worst possible service wold be an understatement but judging from the rfeveiews Cox does not care anyway.First - we have been on hoild for ovefr 30 minutes now. Is that music as annoying to everybody else as it is to me? Next - we have called several tiems now to adress the I Pad issue. So far Apple, our IT peple and Best Buy have advosed that we drop Cox for email because it is notoriously bad.. I guess my comment would be if they get so many complaints would you not think issues like terrible music, incrediblly terrible service and just beeing generally annoying might not be adressed?~~#~0
WOW!  A COMPLETE AND UTTER DISAPPOINTMENT!My wife and I had been bragging on how GREAT this restaurant was to our friends and how they are going to LOVE it!  We brought a couple of our friends (one from out of state) and had some of the worst service and food that we have had.  The service was so bad that she didn't even take drink orders... we had to flag her down to get them.  The Filet and Shrimp...  For $18.50 you expect a nice steak and some shrimp... She got 2 wafer thin cardboard cutouts of steak and 4 shrimp.  The shrimp weren't bad, but the steak was horrible.  They replaced the steak with a piece of grilled chicken (cut up).Our other friend got Spaghetti...She rated it as worse than High School cafeteria food.  At least in High School you know what you're going to get.  She said that the pasta was mush.I got the Baked RigaTony...normally very good... it was very wet and half of the noodles were soggy and the other half were "ok".   My wife's was the same.The server did try to argue with us about the meal, but we asked for a manager.  The manager did comp the 2 meals and give us some coupons to go back, but I'm not sure if I want to risk that again after that!~~#~0
I've been dining at Pei Wei locations all over the Valley for years and years. After moving to Ahwatukee from Central Phoenix a couple of years ago, this location became the closest to me. It used to be reliable and consistent but the last several times I've been, the quality has really suffered. A few months ago I ordered some take-out for my family.  After getting it home and going to eat my meal, I realized that my order was very wrong.  Now I'd become accustomed to this location forgetting things like sauces for the appetizers, napkins, soy sauce and fortune cookies (things that are supposed to be included with take-out), but my dish was inedible to me.  I called to complain, the manager was apologetic and offered that I come back and pick up a replacement OR he would send me a gift card to replace my meal.  Since I have an infant that I needed to get to bed, I opted for the gift card.A month or so went by and my husband suggested Pei Wei.  That's when I realized that I never received the replacement gift card!  We ordered and when my husband picked it up, he mentioned the issue we had the last time and they gave him a discount.  As usual, things were missing from the order (no appetizer sauce, napkins, fortune cookies, etc.) and the food was just okay.Tonight we ordered again, this time the food was just horrible.  Bland, no taste whatsoever for either of our dishes!  I ordered the new Korean BBQ with chicken (I had it before) and really liked it.  My husband had the same but with tofu and vegetables.  Neither of us thought the food was good at all.  The sauce which is normally very tasty was so bland and watery that it literally ran off of the chicken.  The 'salad' that comes with it was wilted and soggy, clearly not fresh.  And as expected, no sauce for the crab wontons, no napkins, no soy sauce & no fortune cookies.  I don't think we will be going back anytime soon - at least not to this location - they really need to get it together.  We're tired of the issues every time we eat in or get take-out from here.~~#~0
Waited here twenty minutes for service! Waiter came and got our drinks and they were never brought to us. My boyfriend and I just ended up leaving. Terrible service~~#~0
My husband used to go here for the Menudo on Sunday, he says it was as close to his Grandma's that he has had yet.We no longer go here because of the health ratings that this place has had. They were almost shut down because it was so bad. Apparently the kitchen is very dirty and in need of a lot of repair. You can read the reports at http://www.maricopa.gov/envsvc/envwebapp/business_search.aspx?as_page_title=Food%20Establishments%20Search&as_type=Food~~#~0
The service was mediocre. It took for ever to he refills on drinks. The corn bread was the best thing there. The salmon dish in the under 550 calorie menu was decent. The pasta dish was really heavy and not delicious!~~#~0
We ended up here because the Mr Good Cents near us had closed down. What a waste. The customer service was poor, they all acted like they were doing us a favor by serving us. My sister and I ordered a #12 which stated it came w sprouts & avocado. They only carry provolone cheese, no other variety. No real choice of bread either. When we sat down to eat we noticed there were no sprouts & a very small smudge of avocado on one part of the sandwich. When we asked about it the guy behind the counter looked annoyingly at us and said they no longer carried sports and that was how much avocado was supposed to be on the sandwich. No napkins, lids or straws came w our order or were any where to be found so I had to wait again to ask some one for them. The girl behind the counter, again rude, stated they were right there behind the counter (out of my vision) and told me to grab them myself. The sandwich was bland and boring don't waste your money here, grab a sandwich from the grocery store.~~#~0
I hate this Dunkin Donuts. Every time I go through the drive thru they say the order back to me wrong, can't listen to how my order should be, and in general are just rude. One of their employees, unfortunately his name escapes me right now, is always lethargic, rude, and acts like he doesn't care at all about his job. Customer service needs to be a priority!~~#~0
Wow. All I can say is wow. I have lived in Scottsdale for a looooooong time and usually when I dislike a place, it's for something like customer service, or overcooking my $35 steak, or a hair in my corn chowder, but this, this was an EXPERIENCE. My best buddy moved back from San Diego this past year and it was her birthday. She loves Mexican food and I had heard about the "great patio" and "delicious margaritas" this place had. It is also next to one of my favorite hotels, the Valley Ho. Well, everything I heard about this place IS true. The margaritas WERE good (better be at over $9 a pop) and the patio is breathtakingly lovely. But OH MY GOD... the food is INEDIBLE, and when I mean INEDIBLE, I mean I swing by McDonald's on the way home for chicken nuggets. THAT inedible. The salsa was so weak I had to ask for hot sauce to basically make it go from tomato paste to some flavor. We ordered a crab dip, and it was just chunks of crab (which I was fairly confident was imitation, but mind you, I was sucking down as many margaritas as I could to mask the horrendous meal I was consuming) and avocados. I didn't even understand it. I ordered mole ribs, and the were inedible. I took two bites, and threw it away when I got to a dumpster. Normally, if it was me just dining alone, or with my fiancee, I would have wigged out, but it was a birthday, for my friend, and in all honesty, our server was top notch. She was so sweet, attentive, and wonderful, and took all of our pictures, and helped us cut the cake and everything. I would have felt bad complaining, ruining a birthday, and frankly, what would I complain about? "Your food tastes flavorless"? "I have had better Mexican food at Del Taco"? I am at a loss at how this place is still in business. It was SLAMMED when we were there. Please, if you want Mexican food in south Scottsdale, go to the Mission. I am embarrassed to say I did not check out what my fellow yelpers would have said about this place, cause I would have steered clear! Dear Tortilla Factory, go to Mexico for a while and learn what a taco tastes like, heck, just save yourself the trip and go to Taco Bell.~~#~0
Food was way overpriced for the taste. Beans overcooked. Tortillas seemed stale. Server was horrible. Avoid this place. Dont waste ur $. Sorry bout iiiiit.~~#~0
We made a trip to the Auld Dubliner after the movies a couple of weeks ago.  We arrived about 10 pm and the place was crowded.  They had a live band and it was so loud that I couldnt hear anything!  We sat down and ordered drinks and waited about ten minutes for them.  After that we ordered off the limited late menu and I had the Corned Beef Sandwich and it was one of the worst meals I have ever had.  The texture and flavor were horrible.  My wife had wings and was not impressed.  The prices were very high for what you received.  We will not be making a return trip here.~~#~0
okay, i was pretty thrilled when i heard there was a new restaurant on mill ave and to top it off it was vietnamese!! my husband and i are always looking for good locally-owned places to eat and after entering the name of the restaurant into google there seemed to be many good reviews so we decided to give it a try last night. upon entering i was rather impressed with the interior and of course, you couldn't beat the location! well, that was pretty much the best part of our visit. we were seated and being it was a thursday evening and the restaurant was still new...it was rather empty, but there were a handful of people sitting outside.the menu was plentiful and there were lots of things to choose from so i was pretty excited. i ordered my usual "pho" and my husband ordered "bun bo hue"....two signature vietnamese dishes. we also ordered a mixed platter of spring rolls.let me start by saying that i'm extremely easy to please when it comes to vietnamese food (even though i'm vietnamese). being raised in southern california, i've had my fair share of vietnamese restaurants and i've been to them all....the "hole in the wall" places and the swanky locations as well. and usually i'm pretty happy with the food...no matter where i go.so our food came out....after almost 30 minutes of waiting!!! the rolls were pretty decent, but definitely not traditional...really fresh, but rather normal..nothing to write home about. once our soups came out everything LOOKED great, but that was about it. husband's bun bo hue soup lacked any real taste. it was as if they just put a ton of chili sauce in it to make it spicy and just added hot water. it was so incredibly bland and the dish was just poorly made. my pho was just as much of a dissappointment. for such a signature soup, i was really expecting more and it was extremely below average. i ALWAYS finish my pho and i didn't even get through half of this.... now the finale...after a lame meal, we were left with a check of over $40!!! WTF!?!? i could have gone down the street to khai hoan (which i highly recommend to those who really want to know what good vietnamese food taste like) where their service is fast, their price is much more reasonable, and their food is superb! i will never come back. the service was horrible, it took forever for her to come take our order and she never came to check on us once. the food was totally over-priced when you could get the same exact thing at a more authentic vietnamese place for half the amount. my parents were coming in to town this weekend and i was really excited to take them to a new vietnamese place, but i surely won't be taking them here. do yourself a favor and visit khai hoan on apache before going to this place. ugh.~~#~0
Consistently bad! I've stayed at this property a few times and dined at Prado every time.  You would think I'd learn. Food is terrible at best, service is nonexistent over 3 hrs for dinner, and crazy overpriced. Anyone who uses Yelp and still goes here gets what they deserve.Went for breakfast next day. The chef came over and spoke to us regarding our experience.  He's trying to clean up the brand, has a lot of work...Will not go back.~~#~0
Terrible food at lunchtime. Flavorless, uninspiring and thus overpriced. There is such good food in Scottsdale- just go somewhere else.~~#~0
Curiosity Killed The Cat?  Your Damn right it did and it wasted my gas!!I was curious, I'd never heard of Steve and Barry's, I figured it would be a cheap way to get out of buying school clothes for my 8Th grader.Shame on all you who hyped this place up.It's like the Big Lots-MacFrugals-Pic-N-Save  version of Old Navy.Not one single thing I would ever buy for myself or anyone else.....EVER!Complete and total CRAP!! Boo Sarah Jessica Parker and Amanda Bynes for putting your name on TOTAL  SHIT!Well it least it wasn't a total loss we headed over to Pac Sun and loaded up on 2 bags full of the cutest new school clothes! Way Cool!~~#~0
I just got back from from lunch at the Scottsdale location. My girlfriend and I have had questionable service there before, and had previously said that we were not going to again visit the establishment. But today, all I wanted was to have a sunbru, relax and eat. The hostess sat us down, which to me, it seemed like we were inconveniencing her conversation with the bus boy. Then, it seriously took the server 5 minutes to come to our table and ask us what we wanted to drink. I had to ask her to bring us glasses of water. I wanted to walk out, but my girl insisted we stay now that we were there. The server was attentive and pleasant, and I began to relax. Then i noticed the hostess, walk behind the bar with her pepsi cup, grab a bottle of whiskey, and continue to pour herself a drink. This seriously fired me up. It seems I have more pride in the brand than she does. I have been a patron of Four Peaks since I moved to AZ 11 years ago. I've had parties at the Tempe location, friends of mine have had baby showers there, and it bums me out to see how drastically things have changed. I support LOCAL as much as possible, but today's episode only serves me to explore my other options..I'll be heading to Chandler to check out SAN TAN Brewery or I will go Nimbus Bistro..bums me out!~~#~0
We go here all the time, unfortunately I will not return due to the owners stating they did not appreciate our business because my total was only $12,although it cost $12 I chose to pay with my hard earned money but this will be the last time I support there business. My coworkers and friends love there food but today shed a light on how little they appreciate our business.~~#~0
My daughter and I came in on a Thursday night.  The place was empty. We stood at the front desk waiting to be seated for 10mins. We finally were seated and we were told that our server would be there shortly. We waited for 20mins and not one person came up to us to ask us what we wanted to drink and to take our order.Several servers and other people who looked like they worked there came by and nobody bothered to ask us what we wanted. We finally left as we didn't have all night to spend on trying to eat.When meals cost $16 and up each you'd expect to get some kind of decent service.This has happened the past few times I have been in there and so I think I will learn my lesson and never come back.Oh and on the way out I got their phone number off their sign and called them and told them about my experience. The girl put me on hold and then another girl came on the phone and I repeated myself. She basically told me sorry and then hung up on me while I was still talking.This place doesn't have the best food in the world to begin with you so would think they could at least serve you in a reasonable amount of time. Especially when the place is empty and the menu is pretty expensive. They have  the  prices of a 5 Star restaurant with the service of a McDonald's.I will probably never come back in there again.I'll advise everyone  I know not to go in there either.~~#~0
I first want to preface this review by letting the reader know that my wife and I are not super picky in terms of food preparation or service. That being said, this was by far the worst dining experience that we have ever had. We arrived on a Saturday night around 7:50 and the "Open" sign was on, but the place was empty. The TV over the bar was turned off and we had to wait a couple of minutes for someone to walk up to the register to take our order. No big deal. We ordered our food and grabbed a seat outside on the patio. Our food arrived and my wife's gyro was cold and the lamb and beef in my souvlaki plate was literally raw. I had ordered it medium and I will eat meat rare if the cook under cooks it, but this was raw except for the outside being seared. Before we had a chance to say anything, the "Open" sign was turned off and the lights inside the restaurant were also flipped off. My wife went in to leave a few dollars in the tip jar, despite the cold and raw meat and asked what was going on. The woman said that it had been slow all day and she called the manager to ask if she could close early. He had said yes, so she began shutting the place down a couple of minutes after she brought us our food. I'm not just talking about doing a little bit of cleaning; all the lights inside were turned off, the cook was stacking the outside chairs around us as we were eating on the patio and the other worker had already pulled up her car to the side door of the place. We could see the two employees back in the stock room staring at us as outside as we wolfed down our cold/raw dinner. It's not like we had rolled up to a place that closes at 11 pm at 10:59.We talked about asking for our money back right then and there, but thought it would be a better idea to talk with the manager the next day and ask him his reasoning for closing down a restaurant on a Saturday night while guests were in the middle of their meal. In an area full of choices to eat at, local businesses can't afford to have willy nilly hours. In fact, while we were eating, five more people tried to order, but the workers turned them away at 8:10 pm....on a Saturday night! We should have gone to Picazzos next door which was packed for a reason; the owners must have a much better understanding of a good business model.~~#~0
I used to like Amsterdam's when I was younger. There was usually a fun crowd, decent music and I would recommend it to my girlfriends as a great place to get our dance on during the weekends. The drinks were decently priced and poured,  and more often than not the bartenders were friendly. Most of that seemed to have changed. I went in there for St. Patrick's day to meet some friends. The place was DEAD, there were about 8 of us in there until well after 10 and the music was awful. The real kicker though? I ordered a club soda which they used a single (low ball, small glass) to squirt some fountain club soda in to and then charged me 3 bucks. I've never in my life been charged for club soda that comes out of a fountain. When I asked about it the bartender was pretty rude. And he really bad hair, like he had stuck his finger in a light socket.  Maybe they think they are in Snottsdale now? Maybe being decent to your customers is going out of style.. Whatever it is they won't be getting any more of my business.~~#~0
Don't ever use the pharmacy here unless and want your prescription to never be ready when you need it.  They are all in a shitty mood and always tell me that they need more staff and are over their heads in work.  The deli counter makes me nervous that they never clean the slicer or the tub of meat that they use to cut the plastic off the boars head packaging for every meat.... Nasty. I do go here for TP and soda only because it 1/2 mile from my place.~~#~0
Nasty, tasteless nuggets of over-fried batter. Even Long John Silvers is better than this dump. Of course if you're a drunk college student you may enjoy this after a night at the bar.~~#~0
Me and my coworkers thought that this was a YC's location.... as it was not!!!! Presentation to me sells everything and this placed looked like a 80's retro theme on accident!!!!~~#~0
I always get a laugh out of Western Dental's ads.  They show clean, middle class people going to nice dental offices for their care.  The reality: the offices are dirty, the waits are long, and the people who look like they are either going into prison or just got out.  If you are looking to get your dental care done where the local gangbangers go, then by all means, this is where you want to be.  The staff is all a bunch of 18 year olds from the receptionists to the techs to the hygienist.  No one there seems to have actual training beyond their high school diplomas, if even that.I went a few times because it is right by my work. Two times I left because the wait was more than an hour.  I did get in after being in the waiting room an hour.  They took me to get xrays, and they then put me in the chair in the treatment area (not room...there's not that kind of privacy).  I waited another hour.  I was asked to sign a contract for $4,000 for completely unnecessary work.  I declined, and got a horrible polishing job by the bored teenage girl and was on my way three hours after walking in.  Skip this place.  They are famous for selling thousands of dollars of unncessary work and seems and having very young and very inexperienced staff (read: cheap, cheap wages).~~#~0
This shop sucks. Bought a $35.00 lighter, within one hour realized it was broken tried to exchange it and they refused telling me I had a attitude problem.~~#~0
Given the option of being punched in the face and waiting in line at the Post Office I'd probably wait in line at the post office.....but this particular location would make me give it a second thought.  Inconveniently located, slow as hell, and ALWAYS full of people sending 20+ small packages to some random place overseas.~~#~0
I walked in and I was immediately digusted by this place. Want a crap load of peanuts? No seriously, when you walk in there is a huge bushel of peanuts, and you can get as much as you want! Done with the shells? Just leave them on the table then brush them aside. The end result? A restaurant with peanut shells all over the place. Actually, to be quite honest, I'm being a little harsh here. I thought it was cool that they did this unlimited free peanuts thing, but it was like they were trying to compensate for something else.Well, when I got my food I figured out what they were trying to compensate for. The salad and 'breadsticks' were just plain bad. However, I didn't really expect much. I was actually hoping my wings would be good and that the salad was just a side. The wings are nothing special at all. I thought the 'El Hefe' wings were somewhat decent, but I don't think I could have more than a half-dozen of those. Hot wings? What hot wings? I thought I ordered some, but maybe the waiter got confused. I got some cold wings with red sauce on them, they tasted 'vinegary' and that's about all.To be fair, the service was pretty good and the server was friendly. She was helping us make decisions since it was our first time, but the food was cold on multiple occasions. A previous reviewer mentioned gorgeous staff... Not quite sure why you would prefer that instead of good food, go to a strip club? Maybe if the food was hot it could be different, but I really doubt it since the recipes here are just way off the mark.There is really nothing special about this place. The wings are over priced for what you get, and there is better stuff available 5 minutes away from here. I love wings, and I've been trying so hard to find a good wing place in Phoenix, but I think my search continues for the time being.~~#~0
Rating:  Two Tum's Down, as in you'll need two tums after eating here. Service: was great,  gave us the 8 samples and i would've felt bad for walking away after trying them.  so despite my gut feeling, i stayedAte: the jerk chicken seasoning is pepper...and lots of it.  had orange chicken quesadilla, jade chicken burrito, black beans, and chicken fried rice.  taste is like panda express threw up at taco bell.  Pros: painting of panda wearing a sombero eating w/ chopsticks while  sitting on a rickshaw pulled by a donkey. try to wrap your head around that for a second... Cons: my stomach hurt so bad it was hard to work after lunch. order up a handful of antacids to remedy the situation.  in a moment of weakness i ate the leftovers a few hours later and was pleasantly surprised by the same pain again for dinner.  i will never eat there again.~~#~0
Welcome to Shill-ville AZ, population at least 2. Within our borders, service lacks any cordiality. Humidity and temperature within the walls are sweaty hog blistering in the month of January. Food takes a little too long for it to be called "Express" and takes even longer to eat it. Why? Because the cuts of meat are akin to those of urban legends more along the lines of Snopes. The only flavorings are eclectically listed on my palate as soy sauce and sugar. When asked for some Sriracha sauce the owner gives thee a look as if asked for pickled human placenta. Let this be a dire message to anyone looking for a true review... would you eat at a place that tries to imitate Yoshinoya?~~#~0
How is this joint still in business? I don't get it. Out of the whole, "I'm going to try something new" I ventured in here some weeks ago and am now dead-set against setting my foot in any place ending in "Bowl."I asked for the spicy teriyaki chicken special. What I got was dark meat chicken in catfood-sized bits smothered in lazy overly sweet goop on top of a gelatinous heap of rice. Spicy? Maybe for Grandma Ethel.The place was depressing to eat at. I looked across 20th Street, and there was Trader Joe's laughing at me. Hell, even Arby's was laughing at me.Not a good sign and a sad day for Japanese food.1 star.~~#~0
Reviews for this place are really misleading.  We went there today, and we were very disappointed.  If you're looking for more authentic Indian food,  this is not the place.  We noticed that the chicken tikka was sweeter than usual, when we asked the chef if it had ketchup or bbq sauce, he mentioned that they did use some ketchup.  We ordered 3 other dishes, biryani, lamb chili, and chicken karahi.  The biryani was not fresh - the chicken was sub-par, the lamb chili was OK - a little bland, and the chicken karahi was relatively the better dish of the night.  Again, there was only one other table that was occupied, so maybe they weren't prepared?We went there because we were at an event where they catered food from there, and that catered food was much better than what we had at the restaurant.   Not going back there.~~#~0
I must of been here during some sort of kitchen meltdown. I say that only because of the very good reviews and I KNOW NONE OF THEIR FOOD COULD HAVE TASTED LIKE MINE.My whole experience was so bad it could have been a sitcom TV show.We sit at a what could have been quaint table on the patio. The linen was crisp and clean. The glassware was spotless. The patio was cockeyed and the floor slanted and we just had to sit at an angle.I don't know if other patio tables here are like this but the two top one closest to the hostess stand is the one I'm talking about. It's the little table where you watch the people coming in.  I didn't think lunch would be terribly long so I thought it didn't matter but gosh if I was old I'd need a chiropractor for my hurt back. This was the most uncomfortable table I ever sat at in my whole life.The iced tea I ordered tasted like bubble gum. ????????????OK so now my back hurts and the iced tea is terrible but I'm still thinking things will be OK.We wait and wait for our salads.I decided to use the ladies room and gosh it was cold in there and if I had nuts they'd fall right off. HONEST it was like walking into a freezer. I guess women who are going threw hot flashes would love it.We wait and wait and our waiter apologies to us and gives us refrigerator cold bread and ice hard cold but pretty swirled butter while we wait.We finally get our salads AND THEY LOOK REALLY GOOD! But my chicken was dry ,it was so dry I think my throat could have gotten splinters and it's not just me being picky. My husband started eating my chicken and screamed about how dry it was. I think they cooked it for 45 minutes and that's what took so long. The salad looked beautiful but I couldn't eat it. A nice girl that worked there asked me about it and I told her the chicken was dry but I couldn't eat the salad because they didn't make the dressing right. I can't say for sure but I think the dressing was just oil with nothing else and it was horrible and not edible. This salad upset my stomach.I did also speak to the manager who seemed concerned. The manager offered me dessert but I declined and he took $10. off the bill.My husband said his shrimp were overdone and he wasn't sure if he had any dressing on his salad and thought he only had a little of the pesto from the shrimp on it. I did notice several large parties were in while I was there and that must have been contributing factor of the problem with the preparation of my meal.I'm sure they are not like this most of the time and it was just me being here at the WRONG TIME.Weird tasting iced tea.uncomfortable table.Ice cold restroom.DRY not good Chicken.Beautiful salad maybe just oil as dressing.Not for me.~~#~0
Old equipment that is usually broken. There is ALWAYS at least one broken machine, usually cardio. The place is very dirty and smelly. The AC never seems to be working. The front desk staff are usually to busy being on their cell phones or talking to other staff to acknowledge you.  I'm considering driving to 43 ave and bell. That is a nice one!~~#~0
I was referred to Apex for a root canal on 1 tooth.  When I got there, they recommended a retreatment on a different tooth that had broken off.  At the time, Dr. Nathan Baker stated, "If your dentist cannot save this tooth, let us know & we will credit your account for this retreatment".   So, I, trusting the Dr., agreed!!  Well, when I went back to my dentist, they were not able to save that tooth.  When we contacted Apex Endodontics & explained the situation, they said a "credit" check would be issued.  When I received the check in the mail, I was more than shocked to see that it was for $32.00!!!!!  They had billed me for $999.00 for the retreatment on a tooth that my dentist did not even refer me for!!!  I am shocked at this!!!   How can Apex Endodontics hold their heads up & expect to get respect when they deceive their client like this????????~~#~0
Ugh. I love Filbertos cheap, tasty food but I hate the service! I called earlier today to see if they could deliver. A girl picked up, said "hold on" and hung up. Then I called back several times and nobody answered. Pretty obvious they were dodging my calls.~~#~0
I don't know why this place has such high reviews?I never feel welcomed when I come here. Which is sad being a new age store, I expect good energy. Yet the people who work here are snobbish and rude. When I inquired about reiki classes they just brushed me off and didn't provide any information for me at all...I only come back for their candles.So disappointing, I wish they were nicer because then I'd spend more money here. Oh well...~~#~0
It took me 30 minutes until my pizza was cool enough to put in my mouth without fear of scalding my tongue and rendering me mute. When I was able to safely eat my order it was very "meh". There's no real taste and it looks like they just pulled it out of a grease sauna.The interior looks like they gutted a Chompies and tried to fill it in a quarter of the space.The service was mediocre at best. For a place that small and with all the waiters going around, how hard is it to drop by the table more than twice?There's nothing really NY about this place. The rape scene with Harvey Keitel in Bad Lieutenant would've been a more enjoyable and a NY experience than eating at this place was.~~#~0
I should have known when we showed up at 7 PM on a Friday night (11/19/10) and half the tables were empty...but we were with friends that had a Groupon, so we didn't protest.  Mistake.  Our server was really nice and checked on us frequently.We started with the pulled pork nachos. The chips were all greasy and the meat was in one massive glob at the top...and was overall flavorless.I ordered the BBQ chicken pizza.  The pizza was flat, hard, dry, and appeared to have been reheated from a frozen state.  The pulled chicken was just sort of sprinkled on top.  I had to smother the pizza with BBQ sauce (which in and of itself was pretty tasty) in order to make it appealing.  The chicken was only so so, but the rest of the dish was just gross.  I think I paid $12 for that, but was wishing I would have had a Papa Johns BBQ chicken pizza instead.  We ordered the peach cobbler for dessert.  I know peach cobbler.  This was NOT cobbler.  Yes, there were peaches.  It was peach pie filling, with some kind of crumbled up sugar cookie on top.  It was thick, gel-like, and gross.  I took two bites and left the rest.  The little scoop of ice cream which cost me an extra $1 (which I was not warned of, by the way) was the only thing worth eating on that dessert item.Extremely unimpressive.  What a waste of a prime retail spot in Desert Ridge.  They didn't even do anything special with the decor...just threw up a bunch of flat screen televisions and called it a day.  I predict this place will be out of business by next Thanksgiving.By the way, the three other adults I was with had similar reviews of their food.~~#~0
This review is for their auto department. Nothing more. I usually don't review places like this, but you know, this experience was exceptionally crappy.On June 31, we decided to go to this Wal-mart to make the "We need a new car battery" experience slightly less painful because one of our favorite coffee shops is nearby -- Elevate. However, we got the new battery and simple enough asked them to clear off some of the corrosion on the terminals. Well, the employee that took "our order" did not notate this nor was the person who took our car keys despite sharing this with them.Then, on July 18, we went to get our oil changed at our dealer. They said "Oh look... you still have corrosion on your battery terminals"... needless to say, after that appointment, we zipped up to Wal-Mart (again) and said, "Hey, what weren't we clear about to begin with" in the most polite way possible. They cleaned off the corrosion with this horrid goo grease stuff. But it seemed to work--at the time.Than, on July 22 (a mere 4 days later), we decided to go visit a friend in Tonopah (oh, a good 50 miles one way from our home). And about 30 miles into the trip, our battery light goes out. Oh no! We safely make it to our destination and our friend, who happens to work at a Dodge dealership, kindly said to take it into the shop in the morning.We did. Oh, guess what? It's the alternator and it's $500 to fix. GASP.We don't accept this as an answer and take it to AutoZone. They said there was a lot of goo--so much so their little handheld device wouldn't even work. They cleaned it up and BOOM our car is just fine.Needless to say, we will NEVER go back to Wal-Mart for our car needs and I highly suggest you don't either. Man, what if our battery stopped working on our way home--9pm on a freeway? Eeps.~~#~0
Stop,  think twice before you make a purchase.  I wish I had.    Be very careful if you accept the delivery you are stuck with a faulty product.   The company policy says you can return within 3 days (fine print:  if not damaged).   We received an office set and didn't notice that one of the wheel casters & internal tracks for a drawer was damaged during delivery.   The policy is to send out technicians to assess and repair.   Received a new drawer which I have to figure out how to install,  and when the wheel was clued by the technician the cabinet teeters back and forth.   I noted I wasn't happy with the solution from the first technican and a manager called me.  I'm now waiting for the second technician to come repair what the first technician didn't fix.   I asked why they wouldn't just replace the piece since so many things were wrong with it and I was told that they preferred repairing items and implied I broke the item.   Who knows if this piece will ever be useful.   Never, never, never again will I go to Ashley Furniture.  They DO NOT stand behind the products they sell.   Customer service is an illusion.~~#~0
Had 1 drink here once last fall with my business partner after a meeting downtown.  It looked cool from the outside and she had been there before and liked it.  I did not.  The concept is cool -- I love old houses and re-purposed edifices and was stoked to try it.  We walked in and it was kinda dead.  There was 1 group of 4 people in the front room chatting and I felt like we walked into their living room and interrupted a private conversation when we entered.  The bartender saw us walk in and walked out thru the back.  We saddled up to the bar. When she returned she didnt greet us or even acknowledge us and then proceded to throw atttitude when I asked what beers they had.  She couldn't recommend anything.  She poured a crappy beer for me (just dumped it into the glass -- my 3yo niece could give a better pour), and a weak drink for my partner and walked away again. The service blew. The whole experience blew.  Not again, my friend.~~#~0
poor service, employee's did not know how to operate register, and manager did not either.~~#~0
WORST PLACE EVER, they sent me a bill the other day for $200 dollars from 8 months ago. They never looked into what my insurance would or would not cover and just screwed me over. Do not go here they are sales men and crooks and will give you an unnecessary hearing test and charge you for it, I'm 29 don't need a hearing test. AVOID at all Costs should really be 0 stars.~~#~0
Sad to say definitely not a fan. Ive experienced much better Mexican for less than half the price. I'd rather get a cheap Crunch Wrap Supreme from TacoBell and save myself a couple bucks. The food wasn't necessarily bad it just wasn't good either. So with prices like that you'd be crazy to actually go back when truth is, it just isn't worth it... like at all.~~#~0
Disappointing service by waiter that wasn't too dialed in.  Multiple trips by our table, but infrequently asked if we needed anything.  Empty chip and salsa bowls as well as empty water glasses were moved to the edge of the table for obviousness, but we still had to ask for refills.  Food was tasty, but WAY over-salted.    Wife's Pina' Colada was watered down (she rarely drinks and she noticed it).Overall, a very so-so experience.  I'll take my $40 to Rubio's for a better experience next time without the sodium poisoning and save $30!~~#~0
This place was awful. I went to 5 thrift stores today, and hit this one last based on the previous recommendation on yelp, it was horrible. No AC in the middle of summer, hardly any stuff, bad vibe. I'm not a picky thrift shopper but this place was scraping the barrel. I appreciate that it benefits a good cause but I'd never go back.~~#~0
This was my first visit to this new location of OSF in the chandler mall, and I'll tell you right now, I don't know if the other locations are this bad, but I will not be returning... If you're wondering why, read on, you'll see.---Service---We had a table of 10, which i understand can be difficult, but in a restaurant this big that seats probably 150 people or so, they shouldn't have trouble with a table of 10. We were seated promptly enough, and our waitress took drink orders while we were still waiting for half of our crew. Once everyone else showed up she took their orders, but completely forgot my friend. He eventually got a water, but by that time we were about half way done with our meal. When the food that we ordered arrived, my friend who didn't get a drink also didn't get his entrée. It came out about 5 minutes after everyone elses. My wife and I ordered garlic cheese bread as an appetizer and we didn't get it until 10 minutes after we were done eating dinner. The waitress said the kitchen was backed up, which I don't buy at all. She simply forgot to place the order until i mentioned it was missing, plain and simple. When the bill came we noticed that the two drinks we ordered were missing from the tab and we notified the waitress of her mistake. What she should have done was apologize for the poor service and numerous mistakes she made and comp'd the drinks and the garlic bread, but instead she corrected her mistake and she threw away an opportunity win some brownies points and any kind of a reasonable tip. Sadly, this had to be some of the worst service I've received at a restaurant in recent history.---Atmosphere----As far as the restaurant itself is concerned, they did a really good job converting a rather eclectic Mexican place into a nicely furnished and modern feeling Italian joint. Our party was seated closer to the front of the restaurant, and because they left the outer doors of the two doored entry way wide open, whenever anybody would come inside there was a giant gush of cold air that would sweep in, making everyone at my table cold while trying to enjoy out no-longer-hot food. What's the point of having two entry doors if you leave the outside doors wide open!! Seriously people. It was pretty noisy and chaotic inside as well. All the waiters and waitresses seemed to be running around like chickens with their heads cut off. The nature of the building also lends itself to being acoustically boisterous, that is to say, this isn't the place to come if you're in the mood for a quiet dinner with your loved one. ----Quality----None of this even speaks to the quality of the food, which is to say, quite sub par considering the prices on the menu. My wife and I ordered the whole wheat spaghetti with mushrooms and marinara sauce. The portion size was smaller than average for a $10 plate, and the sauce was way to wet and there was way to much of it. My spaghetti was drowning in a thin red soup. I've made better at home! My brother in law ordered the chicken parm and his meal was just as bland and boring. The serving of spaghetti he got was tiny, and the chicken breast wasn't even breaded, which may be healthier for you, but it's not chicken parm unless that chicken is deep fried and crispy. The salad we got before the meal was sub standard by any means, low quality ice berg with a few tiny croutons. The creamy pesto sauce that came with it was good, but not so good that it warrants drowning your lettuce in it (which is was). The cheesy garlic bread that we received ten minutes too late was actually pretty decent although a bit greasy for my taste. The sourdough bread was fresh and warm, however, don't expect to get a fresh loaf if the kitchen is out of knives, apparently they won't bring you one unless they have a fresh knife to give you as well. The ice cream we got after the meal was decent enough, I enjoyed the flavor of the spumoni, however, there were ice crystals in it, which leads me to conclude the ice cream tub had been left out and refrozen after a while, ruining the smooth texture it should have. There's no excuse for that. ---Summary----I don't give out 1 star reviews very often, as I'm usually easier to please, but last night it seemed like it was consistently one thing after another that just piled on top of each other. Eating here made me long for olive garden, which at the very least is quieter and as far as I can tell, has much better food. I can only imagine what the lease is costing them for that location, and I'm sad to say it, but I actually hope they go out of business to save anyone else from the experience of dining there. Maybe they can turn things around, maybe they can't. From the other reviews I've seen so far, it appears as though they're making a habit of pissing off their customers. So there's nothing left to say but good riddance, I hope whoever takes over that space next actually puts some thought into how to run a restaurant.~~#~0
I was very excited to try this place out so we went there for a special treat for my son's birthday. The food (burgers)  was gross! Very gross. VERY gross! The server ignored my son (didn't even ask his drink order)  and couldn't have cared less that it was his birthday! The staff looked a little tired and very bored. We didn't wait around to try and get ice cream. We weren't feeling good after lunch! The place is cute with all the pink but it could use a good deep cleaning. I love Family Circus cartoons. I was very disappointed.~~#~0
Have you ever been to a place that you have heard has bad service, and you think it may hve just been a rough day...That was my hopes after being told that the service was horrible I was going to try it out for breakfast, I called to place an order and it was 11:05.  I was propmtly told that it was impossible to get breakfast, because the kitchen was turned over and they stopped serving breakfast at 11.Bad foot to start...So I went to the storefront and got one of the new lunch menus and was greeted by a not very friendly lady with a piercing through her nose who immediately started cussing because of something behind the bar... At this point I was pretty much over it, but I thought it could still get better... Wrong, I ended up leaving and not ordering anything because of how "friendly" everyone was.  I work in the area and will never give business to this restaurant again....~~#~0
Glass they gave me for my wine was way dirty. When I asked for a clean one he could not find one. He had to make one by whiping it out. Then I had to pour my wine in as he did not replace the wine. The dueling tvs were annoying also. Pizza was interesting but a bit too greasy~~#~0
Got seated, barely acknowledged by the waiter. Had to ask for a menu. Asked a question about the menu...got some vague response because he appeared to be too busy for us. Walked out. Wont return. I hate shitty service.bald. K*nt~~#~0
To Tristan,  I do not believe it is appropriate to write a review for your own company and give yourself 5 stars. I would consider that very unethical.  I also consider it to be very bad business to divulge other people's personal information to the public.    You are a terrible business man and I hope people can see that through your poorly written response, which by the way is completely inaccurate. Any reasonable consumer will clearly see that your lack of professionalism and complete disregard for any ownership or accountability for your company's actions is reason enough to never do business with you.~~#~0
If I have to give it a star it is only because of their busty waitresses. This is a miserable place, serving miserable food, with miserably loud music blaring at all hours of the day.If you can imagine, it's a restaurant in Scottsdale trying to reproduce the worst aspects of places like Cancun. Got it?~~#~0
I had been a fan of Houston's (which closed) and was told that Hillstone was the replacement/new Houston's. I decided to give it a try (I was hungry/thirsty driving across town on my way home from being out all day).  I checked in with the hostess and inquired about patio seating (they have a really nice patio).  The hostess informed that the patio seating was limited to sushi menu only.  I asked about bar seating and she said that the bar seating is full menu service.I sat down at the bar and was sitting there about 10 minutes before I could get a bartender's attention.  A female batender walked to the end of the bar where I was sitting and I asked her for an iced tea and menu.  She brought my iced tea and menu about 5 minutes later.  I waited another 10 minutes before I could get her attention (she was at the other end of the bar chatting it up with some patrons) to tell her I was ready to place my dinner order (at this time, I needed a refill on my iced tea).  The female bartender disappeared right after I told her I would have the prime rib medium rare; I did not even get a chance to also request a refill on my iced tea because she left.  About 10 minutes later, a helper from the kitchen comes out with my prime rib and sits it down on the bar in front of me.  I asked him if I could get a refill on my iced tea and he said that he would tell the bartender and disappeared.  The female bartender was still on the other end of the bar chatting it up with the same patrons/not even looking in my direction so I asked a male bartender, Daniel, that was chatting it up with a group of guys if I could get a refill on my iced tea.  About 5 minutes later he brings the iced tea. The vegetables that came with the prime rib were not what I expected (had some vinegar stuff poured on them and I cannot eat vinegar; menu did not say that vegetables would be drenched in a vinegarette dressing); I was hoping to get a side salad swapped out since I could not eat the vegetables.  About a third of my steak had been consumed and I stopped and was waiting to get Daniel's attention (he was still chatting it up with the group of guys) and a helper from the kitchen came up and was trying to take my plate (thought I was finished).  I told the helper that I would need a box (wanted to at least take the rest of the prime rib home).  Daniel appeared with a plastic take home container for me to put my prime rib in along with the bill.  I asked if I could get an iced tea to go and Daniel informed me that they do not do "to go" beverages.I tipped 15% (I usually tip 20-25%) put was even hesitant to tip the 15%.  No one ever checked with me to see if everything was ok (food, needed a refill on my beverage).  Original bartender walked away and left me to fend on my own to find another bartender to wait on me. Other bartender completely ignored me/would not even look in my direction.  Prime rib was good but not worth the $43 tab for a piece of prime rib, 2 iced teas and lack of service.  This place is trendy; if you are not a friend of the bartender, not a regular customer that the staff is familar with (and not ordering unlimited alcoholic drinks), do not expect to get any service or attention.  I will not be back and do not recommend.~~#~0
This place is by FAR the worst nail salon I have ever been to.I found myself in a bind and needed to get a fill right away, so i stopped by here on my way home from work.  My guy was ok.  He made my nails uneven and lumpy, but that doesnt compare to the other things i witnessed. In the time I was there, i saw the guy who answers the phone and greets people (i assume the owner) provide the worst service ever.He was filling a girl's nails and was on the phone the entire 15 min it took.  He never once asked her what she wanted or apologized for not paying attention to what he was doing.  Then while there were 2 other people waiting, he took the phone call outside and chained smoked cigarettes.  After that, I saw him fill one other person's nails in a total of 5 minutes.I would stay away if you want to get your moneys worth.~~#~0
I love La Bocca, but the management has changed for the worse in my opinion.  I adore the same wait staff, they are so attentive, and friendly. I usually go during the lunch hour, but I don't like that the manager is now the host and we can't seat ourselves. I have introduced myself to the manager, but every time I go ( and I go at least three times a week) he doesn't seem to remember who I am.~~#~0
It seems management has told the sushi chefs to exercise portion control. We were served a roll that had so little of the spicy tuna that the end pieces were all rice. Fry's fresh sushi counter serves better rolls! And it's less expensive!!~~#~0
Yet again I left empty handed. I tried to buy 4 items in their weekly ad. They were out of all 4 items. Sooooo, I tried to browse the aisles to see if there was something to buy. Easier said than done. Employees had about 1/3 of the aisles blocked with boxes for restocking the shelves (why the heck can't they do this before the customers are in the store?). Those aisles that I could get down left me chuckling. Target used to have great clearance sales with 75% off of clearance items. The "clearance" shelves are now packed with merchandise that is 15-30% off full retail price. Heck, that doesn't even qualify as a decent "sales" price, let alone a "clearance" price.I actually felt relieved that I wasn't able to find anything to buy, because when I left the store, I noted that there were only a couple of cashiers and the lines looked pretty long. It was helpful when they had TWO entrances. Not only could you park closer to where you planned on making your purchase, the additional cash register and cashier minimized the length of the lines at the main check outs.Sigh, another decent store goes down the drain.~~#~0
Why does it look like the servers had a food fight every day for the past month and vowed to never wash their aprons again?  Get it together, people!  I'm trying to eat here.  Well actually I'm not...I'm still waiting.........waiting..............................waiting..........to be served.  Really????????????????????????!~~#~0
I want to like this place.I really, really want to like it. I'm always on the lookout for a local joint that is special, a place I can take out-of-towners and say, "This is one more thing I love about Phoenix." I had high expectations for SunUp since it is in my neighborhood, a short ride or healthy walk away from homeBut after several visits over the last couple of months and as many disappointments, SunUp Brewing is on my list of places I might go if I'm desperate, not as a destination, and certainly not a place I want representing my city to friends from elsewhere.I'm no beer aficionado, but I know what I like, and for the most part I like the brews at SunUp. I particularly enjoy the Light Rail Pale Ale as a mild-bodied thirst-quencher, and the Vanilla Porter, which is rich without being too sweet or heavy. I also like seeing what seasonal offerings they have, many of which I enjoyed.One constant on my many visits, however, is the truly bad customer service. I don't care if you make minimum wage or six figures; if your job is to take orders and serve people, then do it. Many other Yelp reviewers indicate they have suffered lackadaisical customer service at SunUp, and my experience is that this is the rule, not the exception.Take today, for example: At 1 p.m. on a Sunday, the place was virtually empty save for about three tables and a couple in the main bar area. The last problem I thought I'd have would be getting attention, but my disinterested server/bartender pulled a disappearing act after pouring my beer and plopping my burger in front of me. She was more interested in sitting in a booth in the adjacent room with a paper in front of her, watching TV.If she had bothered to follow up with her customer, she would've learned my burger was the opposite of the medium-rare burger I ordered. Even more aggravating was when she did walk quickly past me (including one time when she told the other server she as heading out back, presumably for a break), she looked directly at my barely touched meal but didn't inquire as to why I wasn't eating it. I'm not going to chase down a server, especially if it involves going room to room to find her. All she had to do was notice I hadn't touched my meal for 20 minutes and ask if everything was OK.I've had similar experiences with the staff at SunUp before although this example was the most egregious. Like other reviewers, I've waited at the bar either with a growler ready to be filled or a bill I'm trying to pay while the bartender chatted with friends even after acknowledging me.It shouldn't be this hard to find a place that wants to sell me something, but evidently the folks at SunUp have more cash than they need, so I see no reason to spend mine there again.~~#~0
Congratulations, Cafe Krishna. You're the first place I've ever given a 1-star rating. I'm a vegetarian an I was fully aware that it only serves vegetarian food, so the low rating has nothing to do with being a disappointed meat-eater.My husband and I ate here for dinner. We were the only people in the restaurant when we ordered and it took 30 minutes for our food to arrive at the table. Somehow, my food was luke warm. Speaking of luke warm, the water I was given to drink was warm tap water with no ice. I can handle drinking tap water, but yeesh, throw some ice in it.When we were finished eating, we waited for the check. And waited. I then asked for the check, and the person said they'd be right back with it. They never came. So we waited. And waited. Finally someone brought us our check.In total we were there for an hour and a half, most of the time just sitting there waiting for one thing or another. The food itself was meh. Nothing spectacular really. I've eaten at plenty of places with terrible service when the food is good enough to balance it out. Definitely not the case here.I might come back someday and try the buffet, but I'll never be back there for dinner.~~#~0
Drove all the way here for what was supposed to be killer food and dessert.What we got was the following.ATTITUDE!Sorry but when you go out to dinner you shouldn't have to deal with attitude having wait staff and managers.The pizza was very very average, maybe they had an off night?The desserts were all fantastic. Although we couldn't order them with our meal the way we were told we could in the bakery area. So we had to finish up, pay and then go back to the bakery area to buy desserts.The good: Salt on the tables is a very good salt and as a chef myself I appreciate that.The desserts are top shelf. Artichoke heart dish was interestingly yummy.The bad: Service was horrible. Manager was rude. Pizza was decent at best. Will probably stop in for desserts if ever in the area but would'nt step foot in the restaurant side again unless it was free.~~#~0
30 minute wait in a drive thru lane is completely redicolus. There were only 2 cars ahead of us! Way to many taco shops in town to even give this place a 2nd chance~~#~0
I just tried to go there and sadly they are  out of business~~#~0
NEVER Buy a Keg from this store. A month ago I purchase a new kegerator from Amazon and decided to order a local craft brew keg from Bevmo. I called ahead and made sure they had the keg in stock before I went over.Went in after work and picked up the keg, a gentleman brought it from the back and I didn't think twice about the keg because I was excited just to have my own keg. I get the keg home and start adjusting the CO2 and I fully realized I would have some waste due to the fact that you need to get the pressure right.Funny thing is after 2 or 3 pitchers the beer was really foamy and tasted really flat, weird I thought since the CO2 was running. I stopped to look at the paper ring around the top of the keg and it said "Best Before July 2012" this was the beginning of October 2012.THEY SOLD ME A KEG THAT WAS ALMOST 90 DAYS PAST THE LAST DATE TO DRINK!! This keg should have been sold in the late spring.I called the store and talked to the Keg Manager and at no point in this process did anyone at Bevmo ever take responsibility for the error. They blamed the distributor that rotates the stock. What about the person that checked the stock & reserved the keg? What about the kid that brought the keg to the register?Reluctantly they agreed to replace the keg and when I went to the store they didn't have the replacement of Oak Creek Ale but instead offered me Fat Tire which was a similar replacement. I never received any type of discount for my time and the hassle. And really only got the "Gee we're really sorry this happened" but it was pretty hollow.Bottom line is, take your business to a grocery store or Total Wine and More.~~#~0
Man, I thought that they had turned a corner when it came to service, but apparently that was a fluke.  I came in for lunch one busy Saturday, gave them my name and no preference for indoor or outdoor, was then ignored for the next 15 minutes as the five top and a three top that came in after me got seated.  The servers passing by wouldn't even make eye contact and the girl checking out customers seemed to forget why we were there.  Ended up leaving and going to AZ 88 instead.  Disappointing.~~#~0
I was so disappointed! Petit Fromage is now located inside Delicious Dishes. There is only a small case of cheese. I asked a staff member which of the blue cheeses she preferred and she wrinkled her nose and said "eww I don't eat blue cheese". HUH?? Needless to say I was ready to walk out. I asked which of the cheeses were made locally besides the one brand of goat cheese I recognized and she began looking around to find the place of origin. These people don't know anything about the cheese and the selection is awful!~~#~0
The one star is based on how the manager on duty tried to BS me into believing the dish I was served was the dish in the menu. I know what a stuffed chili is - that isn't what I was served. To the Manager's credit, after he determined that I was not buying his BS, he immediately asked what I wanted instead, and comp'd my portion of the bill. Overall I agree with others - the food was bland, boring, and not worth the time. I'll never go back.~~#~0
Had to give this one ONE BIG YUCH!~~#~0
You gotta be kiddin me, not even worth the hype, bad Chinese and Mexican, definetly belongs in dives~~#~0
Oops I did it again...but this time I took pictures!I still can't believe what they charge for a stinkin' sandwich, which isn't even that big or tasty! But that is not what brought my update from a 2 start to a 1 star...it was the bathroom!!Oh my goodness! Someone call the maid I think something has died in here (a few times)! Take a look at my pictures, there is rust all over the trash can, a grimmy 'weathered' look over all the appliances and floor, and look at the walls!! It looked like a mixture of orange mold and years of soap scum caked on. The faucet was hard to work, and look at the grim and moldy caulking...grossness....Beware....BEWARE!!!~~#~0
I'm going to have to agree with Aletheia here. Why is this place deserving of such buzz? I fully expected the interior to look like a dive, but I didn't expect the burger to be the blandest thing I've ever eaten. There wasn't a hint of seasoning on the meat, and all I could taste was onion. Even the cheese didn't shine through.I've eaten a lot of hamburgers - I'm obsessed - so I can say without hyberbole that this place served up the worst hamburger I've ever eaten. I can't even fathom why this place is popular with working class stiffs - the cheapest burger is around $9. You can get a better burger at dozens of places around the Valley for that price.~~#~0
