My wife took me here on my birthday for breakfast and it was excellent.  The weather was perfect which made sitting outside overlooking their grounds an absolute pleasure.  Our waitress was excellent and our food arrived quickly on the semi-busy Saturday morning.  It looked like the place fills up pretty quickly so the earlier you get here the better.Do yourself a favor and get their Bloody Mary.  It was phenomenal and simply the best I've ever had.  I'm pretty sure they only use ingredients from their garden and blend them fresh when you order it.  It was amazing.While EVERYTHING on the menu looks excellent, I had the white truffle scrambled eggs vegetable skillet and it was tasty and delicious.  It came with 2 pieces of their griddled bread with was amazing and it absolutely made the meal complete.  It was the best "toast" I've ever had.Anyway, I can't wait to go back!~~#~1
I have no idea why some people give bad reviews about this place. It goes to show you, you can please everyone. They are probably griping about something that their own fault...there are many people like that.In any case, my friend and I arrived at about 5:50 PM this past Sunday. It was pretty crowded, more than I thought for a Sunday evening and thought we would have to wait forever to get a seat but they said we'll be seated when the girl comes back from seating someone else. We were seated at 5:52 and the waiter came and got our drink orders. Everyone was very pleasant from the host that seated us to the waiter to the server. The prices were very good as well. We placed our orders once we decided what we wanted at 6:02. We shared the baked spaghetti calzone and the small "Here's The Beef" pizza so we can both try them. The calzone was huge and we got the smallest one (personal) and got the small 11" pizza. Both were awesome! My friend liked the pizza better and I liked the calzone better. The calzone does have a sweetish sauce but that's how I like my sauce!We had to box part of the pizza to take it home and we were out the door by 6:42. So, everything was great and not like these bad reviewers. That goes to show you that  you have to try these things yourself because all these bad reviewers have some serious issues.~~#~1
Rosie, Dakota, and I LOVE Chaparral Dog Park!!! It's very convenient and surrounded by a lot of paths, a desert xeriscape, baseball fields, ballparks, and a lake with ducks.The Scottsdale Park and Rec Dept. does a wonderful job of keeping the park clean and shaded.  You can find trash cans and poopy-pick up mitts located all over the park and paths.The fenced in area is huge to let the dogs run, play, and sniff!~~#~1
General Manager Scott Petello is a good egg!!! Not to go into detail, but let me assure you if you have any issues (albeit rare) speak with Scott and treat the guy with some respect as you state your case and I'd be surprised if you don't walk out totally satisfied as I just did. Like I always say..... "Mistakes are inevitable, it's how we recover from them that is important"!!!Thanks to Scott and his awesome staff. You've got a customer for life!! .......... :^)~~#~1
Drop what you're doing and drive here. After I ate here I had to go back the next day for more.  The food is that good.This cute little green building may have gone competely unoticed if I hadn't been driving down Palm Rd to avoid construction.  While waiting to turn onto 16th Street the "Grand Opening" sign caught my eye and my little yelping soul leaped for joy!  A new place to try!It looked desolate from the outside but when I opened the door I was put at easy by the decor, smell and cleanliness inside.  I ordered dinner for two, to go.  The menu was awesome.  I loved seeing all the variety: poblano peppers, mole, mahi mahi, mushrooms...something wrapped in banana leaves.  It made it difficult to choose something.  Here's what I've had so far: La Condesa Shrimp Burro and Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco.  They are both were very delicious meals but the shrimp burro stole the show.  So much flavor.  I snagged some bites from my hubbys mole and mahi mahi burros- mmmm such a delight.  The salsa bar is endless.  I really stocked up.  I was excited to try the strawberry salsa but it was too hot, in fact it all was, but I'm a big wimp when it comes to hot peppers. The horchata is handmade and delicious.  They throw pecans and some fruit in there too which is a yummy bonus!As if the good food wasn't enough to win me over the art in this restaurant sho did!  I'm a sucker for Mexican folk art and Frida Kahlo is my Oprah.  There's a painting of her and Diego hanging over the salsa bar, it's amazing.  All the paintings are great, love the artist.~~#~1
Nobuo shows his unique talents with everything on the menu. Carefully crafted features with much to drink. Start with the pork belly buns and a stout. Then go on until you can no longer.~~#~1
The oldish man who owns the store is as sweet as can be.  Perhaps sweeter than the cookies or ice cream.Here's the lowdown: Giant ice cream cookie sandwiches for super cheap.  The flavor permutations are basically endless.  I had snickerdoodle with cookies and cream ice cream.  It was marvelous.~~#~1
Wonderful Vietnamese sandwich shoppe. Their baguettes are great hot out of the oven with butter or in one of their many sandwich choices. They have a modest selection of baked goods along with some of the best egg rolls around. Bring cash or your ATM card as no credit cards are accepted but they have an ATM on premises.~~#~1
They have a limited time thing going on right now with BBQ chicken pizza (not sure how long it's going to last) but let me just say it was amazing.  Probably THE best BBQ Chicken pizza I have ever had.  I have tried other things too, like the tomato basil soup, and many of their sandwiches ... very good, very fresh - every time.  The 5 stars is for the pizza, but if I were to rate Jason's Deli over all they would get about a 4.~~#~1
We went here on a Saturday afternoon and this place was incredibly empty.  They had brunch specials going on, including $2 bloody mary's and mimosas, but we were more in the mood for lunch.  Except for the bloody mary, I had to try one.  It came out in a high-ball-sized glass.  Boo!  But it was really tasty. Yay!  The hubby remembered a sign outside the restaurant a few weeks back that said they had Arrogant Bastard, and he got a 22 oz bottle for $4.75.  Hey, that's not fair!!Next up: the wings.  We were a bit hesitant to order them when the waitress informed us that they are "seasoned" but not sauced, so they can't be ordered hot.  We did ask for them crispy though, and the waitress even asked the cooks to throw them back in for a few minutes when they came out not visibly crispy.  These non-traditional wings were actually pretty damn good.  The seasoning was a little spicy and salty with just a hint of sweet.  If I were in the mood for the tang and kick of Frank's Hot Sauce, these wouldn't cut it, but otherwise they were good enough to go back again for.My entree was the Tilapia salad, and I was a bit disappointed.  The fish was a bit dry and uninspired. And the greens underneath were overdressed and wilted.  I ate the greens around the fish and picked out the almonds and Mandarin oranges, but I had to leave the mush hiding underneath the fish.It wasn't bad enough to say I wouldn't go back, but I won't be anxiously awaiting my next trip.~~#~0
okay this is the best place EVER! i grew up shopping at the one in los gatos, and the one in Oakville. i was shock when i saw the best store in the world in Scottsdale and then not surprised at all. the have all the good stuff. from cheese down to wine. i can't tell you how happy i am that this store is here in Arizona. now if we could just get dean and deluca!~~#~1
I met a friend for lunch yesterday. Loved the water feature and patio walking in, if it had been warmer I would have definitely sat outside. Inside was a little dark and I guess it was all the bats around but it reminded me of "Dusk Till Dawn". We were seated, I hope was hoping for chips and salsa, I guess they don't serve them here? We weren't even offered the ones on the menu, which I probably would have declined anyway because chips and salsa should be complimentary. Anyhow I ordered the Fresh Snapper Tacos (see pics) There is a lot of fish there being smothered by all those peppers, but as for everything else what you see is what you get.For $15 I would have liked more than a TBSP of each, rice and beans, and a DEFINITELY more than a teaspoon of cheese and sour cream and maybe a lime or lemon. There was more garnish on the plate than anything. Other than that it was good. My Friend ordered the Green Chile Stew and The Green Chile Mac and Cheese (see pics) She has been here before so knew what she liked. I tasted the macaroni and thought it was pretty good too.I'll give 3 stars until I go back and try out some other things.~~#~0
DVAP....You have to go at least once in your life. It really is a neat place with alot of history. The service is great, it appears to be family run. The food is good. Better then Dennys but not as good as Mimi's. I had the all u can eat of beef ribs, lasagna, meat loaf, cat fish, chicken, mashed and diced potatoes, stuffing, rice, homemade apple pie, etc and salad bar. I know I am missing a bunch of stuff they had but you get the drift. They run specials on Prime rib and stuff so you might want to call to see what they are serving the night you go.~~#~0
This place shouldn't even be reviewed - because it is the kind of place I want to keep for myself...  =)~~#~1
first time my friend and I went there... it was delicious!  The food, garlic knots our favorite and of course the wine!  We will be going back ALOT!~~#~1
U can go there n check the car out. If u wanna buy 1 there? That's wrong move! If u even want a car service from there? U made a biggest mistake of ur life!! I had 1 time asked my girlfriend to take my car there for an oil service, guess what? They ripped my girlfriend off by lying how bad my car is now. If without fixing the problem. Might bring some serious accident. Then she did what they said. 4 brand new tires, timing belt, 4 new brake pads. U know why's the worst? All of those above I had just changed 2 months before!!! What a trashy dealer is that? People, better off go somewhere!~~#~1
I love this place! I have been coming here for ages.My favorites: Elsa's Chicken sandwich, any of their burgers, dragon chicken wings, china's little chicken sandwich, and the hot pepper chicken sandwich. The atmosphere is always fun and the art they display is very abstract but totally cool!~~#~1
I love love LOVE this place. My boss (who is into healthy eating) recommended this place. I went over with some highly skeptical friends and one dinner was enough to convert them into believers! The food here is so good! We had the Shrimp dumplings and the Onion tart as starters. We ordered the Shirataki noodles and street tacos as entrees. So also ordered the Kale-aid. All of the dishes were yummy. I have gone back many times since then and have never been disappointed! I have gone after yoga to get some Kale salad or the chicken chopped salad. I always have to get the Kale aid. Once, a guy at the next table, uprooted a whole plant by mistake (on the patio) and was highly embarrassed as was his date! Ever since, I have very careful not to throw my arms around as I can be quite clumsy sometimes! I do NOT want to be banned from my favorite place for my clumsiness! I don't think I can live without True Food!~~#~1
Disclaimer: Like many of you, I am a sucker for charming little homes that have been re-purposed into restaurants. I am certain that this colored my opinion of Cibo.That being said, I absolutely love having lunch here the other day. I unknowingly arrived at 2:05 (5 minutes after they close between lunch and dinner) but was served anyway. I had the salscicia sandwich and a side of fruit. The sandwich was excellent, served on perfectly crisp, chewy saltimbocca bread. The sausage was flavorful and was complimented by roasted red peppers and onions. All this was finished off with a great quality mozzarella cheese. Really, really delicious.I should also say that the atmosphere here was friendly and  comfortable, though a bit small. This would be a great place to hang out if you lived nearby.~~#~1
Disgusting!  Had a Groupon so my daughter and I tried it out.  Very outdated and gaudy 80's style interior made me feel like I was in an episode of Sopranos.  The food itself was pretty bad.  We ordered pretty simple dishes but they just had no flavor at all!  After trying it out I'm positive all the good reviews on here are employees or owners creating them.~~#~1
Never having dealt with a Discount Tire in Phoenix before (only in Texas, and their service has been great all the time), I came in not knowing what kind of service to expect. I was pleasantly surprised! The store had a good amount of parking, and the store front was clean, open and had adequate seating around the perimeters. There were already 5-6 people sitting and waiting for their cars to be finished, and 2 people waiting infront of me to see a representative. All the guys working there were busy helping someone, yet were saying hello to us and reassuring they'd get to us very soon. I didn't wait an unneccesary amount of time and then was helped by Wally. He inspected my tires, recommended a plan of action gave me options, and we headed back into the store. After I made my decision to replace 2 of the tires, he checked their stock, and unfortunately they didn't have them there. BUT he called another store and had them picked up for the next morning, so I could just come back the next day to this same store and get those bad boys installed. Great! The prices were not as heafty (relief), and although there were a good amount of people the next day waiting for their cars to also be serviced, it took exactly the amount of time they'd told me (45 min). They apologized for the wait, but no need for that! The guy who helped me on the 2nd day (I'm sorry I forgot his name) was also very professional and great. I recommend this store and will be bringing my car here in the future most definitely. Thanks, guys!TIP: If you know you need to bring your car in, you can make an appointment with them online. They take walk-ins, but I believe it helps them manage their customers easier, and that in turn benefits you.~~#~1
There's two ways to look at this place. One is getting quality food at a good price. The other is getting a lot of food for a cheap price. I prefer the former but those who prefer the latter won't agree with my review.I thought the scramble I had was okay but nothing fantastic. I definitely didn't care for the biscuits. The food wasn't health conscious at all but if you're looking to fill up with calories and get a good-sized portion then this is your type of place. Also, I am not a fan of the diner-type ambiance... I would rather have something with more character but I'm glad I tried this place out.~~#~0
I've eaten here many times, but none as bad as last night.Service was excellent, and highly attentive.Food, absolutely horrible.My expectation was they would serve a steak on par with their seafood. After all, they were charging 39 bucks for a ribeye. What I was hoping for was a 1- 1-1/2' thick steak, cooked Pittsburgh style as I had ordered. What I got a a 3/4 in thick piece of meat that was mostly fat, gristle, and in no way resembled Pittsburgh Style. Salad, similar to something you could get at Chick FiletVeggies, blah.Bread basket, ample, but day old, and if not, it certainly wasn't fresh. In addition to bad food, we were crammed into a small room where we were nuts to butts with 6 other tables, listening to conversations ranging from someone's recent bout with pinkeye, and another couple who elected to speak entirely in French, until the waiter showed up, then it was like they turned off the French switch and suddenly began speaking English. I've had it with this place.If I'm going to pay 150 bucks for dinner, it'll be at Mortons, or Maestro where the steaks are 1-1/2 in thick, cooked to perfection, and half of it doesnt wind up on the plate as fat and gristle~~#~1
Everything was nice. The ice cream was delicious, no overwhelming alcohol taste & an interesting variety of flavors. Service was fine, place was clean. I'll go back, but only because I have a killer sweet tooth and they're in the neighborhood.~~#~0
(Un)fortunately for me, lux is close to my house.  I walk there nearly every day and am much poorer because of it.  The coffee and pastries are amazing.  They always play really great music too!~~#~1
After watching her win on Cupcake Wars I was determined to find this place (It's very well hidden)and sample the cupcakes.  I have to say I was not impressed; i make better cupcakes on my own.  More creative and not so sweet you'll go into a diabetic coma.  i did have a California BLT as well and it was a good sandwich although the bread was a little too toasted for my liking.  The staff was friendly, the ambiance was very pleasant and it was clean.  But the cupcakes...really not all that.  Sorry....~~#~0
Fred M. pretty much said what I would say, so I won't beat a dead horse.  I'll add, though, that they offer a wide variety of deep-fried quesadillas.  Did you catch that?DEEP FRIED QUESADILLAS!~~#~1
Alright, I have been away from Yelp for quite some time, and I feel that this place is fitting to be my comeback review...Chicken and Waffles.  Yes, chicken and M'Fin waffles.  In the ghetto?  CheckHas sweet tea?  CheckHas no-nonsense, quick service?  CheckRidiculously long wait?  CheckBest thing that I have eaten in the last year?  CheckI have to say, not the best fried chicken I have ever had, but pretty damn good- it could use more seasoning.  Now the waffles, probably the best ever...  The waffles are deliciously soft inside, a little crispy out with a wonderful cinammoness to them.  The seating is cramped, but it doesn't matter as soon as your food is delivered your table goes quiet, you get tunnel vision and after the first bite you are taken away to an orgy of goodness.If you are in Phoenix, this is a requirement.  Come real early or be prepared to wait.  Don't forget to order the Red Velvet cake and they have Kool-Aid if that fits your fancy.  Even after I came home from Arizona, I couldn't stop talking about LoLo's for like 2 weeks.  Shoot, two months later and I am still drooling thinking about it...~~#~1
This restaurant is incredible, and has the best pasta carbonara and the best tiramisu I've had in my life. All the food is wonderful, though. The calamari is not fried. The bread served with dinner comes right out of the oven, and the tomatoes are the freshest I've tasted outside of my mom's own garden. This is great attention to detail.I can no longer eat at any other Italian restaurant without feeling slighted. This is the first place I want take out-of-town visitors I'm looking to impress.The owner, Jon, is helpful, friendly, and really cares about providing a positive dining experience. He's spot on with his wine recommendations, and he organizes wine tasting events which you can find out about by joining the mailing list or Facebook page.~~#~1
I have always been a fan of Burlington's deals, however I will not be shopping at this one again. I went to return a belt... pretty simple. Instead, I stood in the customer service line for 15 minutes thanks to an employee of Burlington buying/putting things on layaway. It took three other staff to help her out. There were no words said to me except "Hold on". I was pissed. When the lady was finally done, the employee at the service asked "what do you want?" Serious help is needed there! If you work in the area of "customer service" I think you should have some.~~#~1
If I could give 4 stars for atmosphere and 3 stars for food I would.With all the hype of getting a Margaritaville I guess was expecting a little more in the way of Margaritas and cheeseburgers. But I was underwhelmed with both. You can get a much better burger next door at Yardhouse and a much better selection of Margaritas from Salty Senorita. With that aside this place is quite the spectacle. It has 2 stories, a stage, fishing boat booths, and every other piece of decor that a Parrothead could love. TV's broadcast Jimmy himself rocking out and some odd montages of Parrothead outings. Live music is offered here several nights of the week and they offer 2-3 bar areas. If defiantly won't become part of the regular rotation but from time to time we might wonder in looking for our lost shaker of salt.~~#~0
Another night meeting friends here.  I have to laugh.  Waited another 20 minutes for my beer to be refilled at the bar.  A girl even took my empty without even asking if I wanted a refill.  A new brunette girl that I don't recognize left the bar and sat down with her guy friends on the customer side AT 9:25 ON A FRIDAY NIGHT.  Another bartender had to ask her to come back and work.  Management....  Pull your head out of your ass!  Sad to watch....  I need to talk my friends into another place!~~#~1
Not busy at all but took nearly 45 min to get our meal.  Ordered the trout and was shocked to see lots and lots of bones. Hmmmmm. Well asked the waitress about it and she said "they try the best they can"  hmmmmmm isn't this a "fish" restaurant? They comped the trout but still not sure I would go back.~~#~1
This an incredible church that embraces the principle that ......Christ Life Church exists to bring people into a life-changing relationship with Jesus Christ.  Three campuses allow Christ Life to reach into several locations...online, Tempe and Casa Grande.   The wonderful children's and youth programs appeal to a wide perspective of people.~~#~1
This is our favorite breakfast place. The food is good. They have the best biscuits & gravy of any restaurant I have eaten at. The wait staff is friendly. The only complaint I have is that Sunday mornings are packed, so there can be a wait to be seated.~~#~1
I had looked at several invitation websites along with catalogs with no luck in finding just the right balance of wedding colors/design.  Thomas at Alphagraphics helped me every step of the way of designing and printing our wedding invitations and programs.  I knew I wanted a booklet-style, but needed a little design creativity from Alphagraphics which they nailed!  I highly recommend Alphagraphics to anyone needing any print work done - not just wedding invitations.  Thomas and his crew are stellar!!~~#~1
Yikes, reading other reviews I realize my bad experience wasn't unique. As a server I make a very laid back customer. I like pretty much everything I eat and don't require a lot of attention from the waiter. La Piccola Cucina would benefit from just one extra person in the front of the house. Our guy, though adorable and friendly, was too busy to refill our drinks and to remember to bring our appetizer (though charged us for it). The ahi tuna (highly recommended over the other fish options he said) was so overcooked it was the color and consistency of chicken. Like other reviewers mentioned, he was frantic and made that clear to every customer. At one point I even saw him in the kitchen cooking - they need another person! I left super stressed out from the experience, which is very, very unusual for me. You can either have bad service or bad food, but not both.~~#~1
I absolutely love this little spot! It's a great little known boutique with incredibly unique gift items that I don't have to drive clear out to Scottsdale to find. I've been shopping at Vignettes for about 8 years. Whenever I am in a quandary about what to get someone, this is the first place that I head to. Mostly it is because of the wide range of specialty items that they have on hand. Whether it's something for the garden, a gift for the new bride or baby, a unique piece of art, or heavenly scented candles - you will not be disappointed.The owners / staff are super friendly and have always been more than willing to help find something within a price range or based on occasion / need. And they do the most amazing wrap jobs, making gift giving even easier.The final bonus is their annual Clearance sale. For three days each year they basically blow out their stock to make way for new finds. Ask to be put on their mailing list to ensure your have a heads up and get there early because long time customers like myself never miss it. : )~~#~1
Came here with a large group a while back.  We were there to eat and have a beer before a concert there. It was a weekday so we made it to happy hour. Happy Hour pricing was fair. The food was pretty good. The very best thing there is the beer!  They had like everything on tap! MMMM!~~#~1
This is my first year participating in Arizona to sell clothing, just wandering how busy its goona be in there ??? little worried, can any one reply me ??~~#~1
Beer...or Yoga?Located in a small center just east of Four Peaks Brewery in Tempe (a reasonable distance from the light rail on Apache), is an amazing, classy studio for the Mind-Body connection.Mr. Mustachio had decided after doing a couple yoga classes with me at the ASU gym that he loved the stretch, so pursued a class for a semester at ASU this Spring and had the pleasure of practicing with Tish Hegel. After seeing his body transform to only 16.2% body fat, all his jeans get too big on him and fill out his American Apparel briefs nicely I was super jealous. He raved about his teacher and I could tell he had de-stressed a lot since he started the practice.Luckily, she opened up a studio recently, and it simply goregous. The waiting area is filled with yoga material and a very calming space with a remodeled bathroom and dressing rooms to change if coming from work/school. Not at all cheesy like the SouthWest Inst with the way too many angels imagery (creepy!). But the gem is truly the practice space. Hardwood floors, high ceilings, a beautiful staircase, tasteful decorations and absolutely NO MIRRORS.  That is right- the only person staring at my pudge rolls is my teacher and who-ever isn't focusing on their tree posture-not the entire class! It really relieves a lot of stress  and helps me concentrate on how a posture feels as opposed to just looks.As for Tish Hegel, she is simply outstanding-she has so many credentials, you have to read her biography for yourself. She has been practicing for a loooong time, and her hands-on instruction and confident voice echoes in my ears even now (bring those shoulders down!). So far, I have done:  Ashtanga Inspired Flow (pretty intense, really hurt for 3 days, would recommend after getting into yoga for a while), Sivananda (ditto),  Focus Class (did a lot of bike riding and she focused on everybody's body issues and did the sequence right then and there for us and my lower back and knees felt amazing the day after) and this morning brought my friend to Kinetic Yoga: Morning Movement and Flow, which kicked our 6am asses a little bit but we both felt amazing afterwards!  She does tons of modifications, is always making sure we are okay, and is just super personable.I did the huge package since I didn't renew my ASU gym membership for this summer, but you can do drop-in. Now for the cliched Yoga Review ending: NAMASTE!~~#~1
really, I can't believe this place has received such high reviews from people.my lady and i walked in, and were greeted rather rudely by a pretentious bitch at the front with a monotone "name please?", instead of a warm, friendly, french welcome to this rather charming looking place. we didn't have a reservation, which from the looks of how dead empty the place was, didn't seem like a problem. until the hostess whisked through her reservation list and explained she'd try to "fit us in". it was 6pm, the place had one other couple dining, and we were informed that the next party was arriving at 7:30. we weren't really looking to hang out. it would have be awfully lovely if yelpers would have informed of the need to MAKE RESERVATIONS before going in here, because if you don't, you're automatically a piece of shit according to the staff. sorry, i don't plan very much ahead. next time i will, and it won't be here.anyways, after debating for a minute or two with herself, the hostess decided we could "squeeze in" and sat us right on top of the other couple inside the restaurant. she informed us that we could cork our own wine, for their low low price of 9 fucking dollars. in words only office space could adequately describe,"coup des tartes, what is it exactly that you do?". the food was good, nothing spectacular for $25+ a plate. we got a salad with apples and nuts and bleu cheese, which was served warm. now this is the first warm salad i've had all of my life, and by no means am i some sort of wordly food expert, but i believe salad should be cold and crisp. not soggy and warm. yuck. the cordon bleu was tasty and filling, however, the wobbly table was an extreme annoyance when cutting through the chicken, but it was solved (with no thanks to the staff) by placing a jack-in-the-box gift card under the leg. i will admit, the mashed potatoes are some of the creamiest and best i've ever had. my lady got the pork tenderloin, which had a strange peppery-sweet pairing which i didn't particularly care for. we were broke for desert, so unfortunately we didn't get to try any tarts. you would think for a place that promotes itself as being so poise would get some fancier menus, other than a $.15 piece of cardstock copied in bulk at kinkos.this place was rather disappointing. i honestly thought it would be way more comfy and welcoming inside but it really wasn't. it presents itself as being so high class and french and oh-la-la wee wee, but when it comes down to it, it's still located in a tiny shack of a house at 16th street and highland. maybe if it were located in the biltmore i'd give it a bit more cred.~~#~1
Figured it is time to write a review after going here for quite a few years for dinner on special occasions or just to have some of the best seafood and Bone in fillet around. First off you have to understand that the cuts are top quality so you can order almost any steak off the menus and be dazzled by the flavor, which is fantastic to the point that adding anything to it would destroy the integrity of the taste as is. I mean the meat is perfection on a plate and this needs no other explaining.If with friends or even your significant other you must start with the the seafood tower, which can be order in many different ways to match your appetite and likes. When presented at the table you and your guests will be blown away at the quality of the seafood and rightly so as it is brought in fresh daily.The sides are too awesome in their taste and quality and i suggest the Lobster mash or the Maestros Mash potatoes neither of which will leave you hungry in their own right, but often wanting more :) Wine selection is great and the atmosphere is top notch, but topping it with some of the best servers in town makes this one of my favorites for entertaining. you will not be disappointed.~~#~1
I can't describe to you how amazing these gourmet adult hot pockets taste! They literally MELT in your mouth- a few of my favorites are the Cajun Chicken, Dill Salmon, and the Stilton & Steak---Bon Appetit everyone! And don't forget about the all day everyday-$3 car bombs(you can't beat that price) their happy hour is amazing, too!~~#~1
I was really excited about this event, maybe my expectations were too high, because I was really underwhelmed.  Very little shade, ran out of water, by the time I got there at 1pm (other obligations) 20% of the vendors were out of food, and by the time I ate my way through some, everyone else was already out.   60 bucks for that?  I don't think so.  And when I mentioned it to "the person in charge", he was patronizing, invalidating and kept telling me how happy the chefs were.  Well, I'm your consumer, big guy.  Sorry, Devoured, wish it could have been better. What food I did try, was pretty good.~~#~1
The beach paradise of Ixtapa-Zihuatenejo awaited us....unfortunately, so did a connecting flight in ARIZONA of all places...Long story short....1/3 of our luggage did not arrive at our final destination, various articles of our clothing are still missing as well as my cell phone charger...not to mention security forcing us to open sealed containers of my son's baby food and milk for litmus tests...I looked on the bright side....at least we didn't get deported =)~~#~1
So very Portlandia in its hipsterness and decor. Premium coffee roasted in-house, in the middle of the desert, no less! Who would have thunk it.Baristas were profesh and friendly. They even warmed up our pastries upon request. Perfectly foamed milk and fruity noted espresso. I hope this place has a long life in Scottsdale, where great coffee is few and far between.~~#~1
Awesome subs clean and friendly well priced.~~#~1
I LOVE Chic Nails!I used to go to Tip & Toes on 48th street and Ray Road, until one day they were "too busy" to take my friend and I in for pedicured. We discovered Chic Nails and have been doing all of our manicures and pedicures there since. The staff is extremely friendly and they give the best pedicures for a very reasonable price. I highly recommend this nail salon over any other!P.S. It is extremely close to CK's Bar & Grill to go for happy hour after! :)~~#~1
After the Padres Spring Training game, we had reservations at Don & Charlie's in Scottsdale .  None of us had been here before and it came highly recommended by my dad.  As soon as you walk into Don and Charlie's your eyes start feasting on all the signed baseballs down the left wall.  Now everywhere you look from floor to ceiling and even the ceiling itself is covered in memorabilia and autographed items from athletes of all sports and other celebrities.   Besides the amazing assortment of sports artifacts, I especially like the Cactus League Beer List which pairs a beer with each city that has a team in the Cactus League.  Colorado = Coors Light , Texas =Shiner Bock, Chicago =Old Style, and San Diego =Stone IPA, etc.  Also worth mentioning is the complimentary chopped liver platter with rye bread and bagel chips they bring as soon as you are seated.  I had the ribs with coconut shrimp combo which was great. I wasn't thrilled with the side dish: potato's au gratin which is a $2.50 upcharge.  They also bring a huge bowl of cole slaw with each entrée or you can choose soup which comes in a smaller bowl than the cole slaw!  We were too full for dessert and as we walked out, this place was packed!  I found myself trying to take in as much memorabilia as possible and then on one side of the crowded lobby there sat Willie Mays himself.  He was signing his book (or a baseball) for a $200 charitable donation to his foundation. Needless to say, I 'm not bringing home any memorabilia myself!~~#~1
Best food, super friendly staff, and great prices. Love it!~~#~1
Christy is an amazing cake artist.  She has an impressive portfolio as she has a flair for creativity.  Her cakes are amazing and are truly one-of-a-kind.  She also has several delicious cake flavors to choose from or she can create one for you.   She has made several cakes for our family and I have been impressed with everyone of them.  I was also excited to see her compete on TLC's Ultimate Cake Off show early this spring.  If you're looking for a sculpted cake or one that will be the center of attention at your next party, then I recommend you call Phoenix Cake Company.~~#~1
Great food and awesome service! Even better that the Chef came out and personally checked on our experience. I will be back for more delicious BBQ~~#~0
See the huge sign outside that says $2.50? Yeah, that's for shirts only. I was caught off guard when I brought in my skirt and got nailed for about $3.79. As I sadly handed over my $5 bill, the lady at the counter said a lot of people had told her they felt betrayed by the sign outside. No kidding. I had originally been heading down the street to Regal on 7th Ave.--who does a fine job in half the pickup time--for the "advertised" fake price here. Trying to make the best of it,  I told the lady at least I'd learned they had an onsite alteration service, and maybe that was worth a buck. UH OH. Picked up my skirt a few weeks later with some Jersey Shore-type chick at the counter, and was told I owed another $3.79. I flat-out refused to pay twice. She screamed at me, chased me to my car, wrote down my license plate and said the police would be visiting. Ni-i-i-ice.~~#~1
After driving down a teeny dimly lit road and coming across what looked like a medical office building in the 60's, my husband and I found the amazing Fuego Bistro. We had a perfect meal there. Amazing ambiance, twinkly lights in the courtyard, live musician. Great wine. Food was so unique and delicious- I'd describe it as Southern-Spanish fusion. This meal was the highlight of our trip to Phoenix. If you live in Phoenix, you have no excuse to not come here. I live in Chicago and I'm sure I'll be back.~~#~1
As Target's go this one is standard fare. That consistency is part of their brand recognition. However, as a part of the Up-Scale Desert Ridge Shopping Center, I'd expect a bit more than a Standard Target. Don't they have some sort of a Flagship Target?Also traffic and parking can be atrocious at Desert Ridge. I drive to Target's and WalMart's much further from my house because the round trip time is less when I don't have to negotiate the teen packed Desert Ridge lot. Probably safer too.~~#~0
It's just like pizza bianco without the wait. This pizza is a 9.9999 and bianco is a 10. This place has a much larger menu and their deserts are to die for. If bianco has more then a 30 min wait just drive and or walk here.~~#~1
As mentioned earlier, the best thing about this place is the super cheap, but super delicious lunch bentos.  You get a main dish, rice, salad, and an orange for under $4. If that's not enough, you can get double meat for a buck or two more.  I highly recommend the ginger pork or the katsu.  My friend I normally go with is a big fan of the white fish (fried or grilled).  The sushi here isn't bad.  It's nothing super special, but I don't come here for the sushi so it's not a big knock against the place.As they would say on ebay: A+++ Great Seller! Would eat here again!!!~~#~1

Unless you are a regular or look like your wallet is fat don't expect the best service.  Entrees cost about 20-38 bucks and Anti pasta runs between 5-20 desserts are all 8 bucks unless you get aged balsamic vinegar.  They also have a big cheese selection. I made reservations for this restaurant and they sat us by the back door.  The waiter never once explained anything on the menu or suggested a wine to go with our meal.  He didn't even tell us about the cheese menu except to check on the one we wanted.  The other waiter for a table near ours went out of his way to explain the menu and go as far as to tell his tables how to eat the cheese ( it comes with jelly's and such) .  My meal was good I had the duck.  She had the salmon which tasted very fishy.  Not fresh at all.  The wine was 40 bucks for a carafe ( maybe if we would have got a 100 dollar bottle we would have gotten better service)  The Dessert was good it was a rich chocolate cake with nuts and chocolate sauce. Nothing too special.  Overall the experience made the meal not worth the 115 bucks in these times not to mention they overcharged my girls card for the drinks at the bar.  If we dont want to give 25% don't charge it plain and simple.  Just a warning reservations and customer service mean nothing.  We mentioned our complaints to the waiter and manager.  We received an apology but how bout comp our dessert or something.  Hyatt Gainey staff is also rude for the most part.  Two thumbs way down.~~#~1
Returned Sunday afternoon and was  pleasantly suprised. Happy Hour is 7 days a week 3-7 pm   ; )    I recieved great service at the bar which was friendly fast and efficient(Janessa) .I ordered couple of drafts and wings with good happy hour pricing! I will be back!~~#~0
Hit or miss food. I ordered the meat plate with corned beef, zuch and asparagus for the sides. Corned beef was WAY too salty, and same thin style you get on a sandwich. I sent it back for a chicken breast bone in, which was the driest chicken I have ever had. The side veggies were good (perfectly grilled no butter), and accompanied by garlic bread. I think this place has potential but I ordered wrong. I sat at the bar and service was mediocre. Price was pretty low though. Good place to watch the game.~~#~0
Absolutely the best sushi in the valley, hands down.  The fish is fresh and their spicy tuna is like no other.  However, the service is extremely slow. We once waited 75 minutes to get our lunch and the restaurant wasn't even full.  Can't say much about the cooked food though, but the sushi is amazing.~~#~0
Take your money elsewhere, unless you've got kids.  I really try to like this place.  A family member signed me up for the discount card, so I've been going more often, but I just don't love it.  It's simply ok, but the prices are outrageous.  And the sounds and animatronics are a huge distraction from the so-so food.  The cocktails are alright, but, again, the price is not right.  The ony thing fun about the place for an adult is the gift shop and the light-up cocktail glasses (which cost extra.)  I've seen a lot of happy families in here though, so I bet it's better if you have little ones to bring along.~~#~1
Took my fiance' there for Valentine's day/ Birthday.  I did a lot of research of romantic places around the Valley, and this one really caught my eye.  Immediately after walking through the door, you'll notice a dark and romantic ambiance with a lot of candle light.  Seating is a bit tight, but it wasn't bad enough for me to give it a lower review.  We began with an appetizer called "Table side guacamole" which was incredible to say the least.  It literally is made in front of your table.  Then it was onto the main dish... Build-your-own  Pork tacos.  Talk about tender meat!!  The shoulder of pork literally fell right off onto the fork.  The tortillas were exceptional, and so was the tasty sauce which included pineapple glaze.  So, the food was absolutely delicious...but the service was equally impressive.  My water level never reached the bottom of the glass the entire night, and I drink plenty!  Everyone was incredibly nice and cheerfully said "Happy Valentine's Day!" and "Happy Birthday!" to my fiance', which made the experience even better.  A fantastic place that I'll have no problem recommending to others to visit!~~#~1
I have had a great experience every time I have been there.  The food is hard to beat and the service was pleasant.  Portions are reasonable, not huge (I'm a big feller), and I was satified every time I ate there.  Very pleasant environment, clean, spacious and calm.~~#~1
I love this restaurant!! I have been a fan of the Newport Beach location for years. Scottsdale definitely did not disappoint! The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. The drinks are fresh (worth the extra wait for the tasty Cucumber Jalapeño marg). And the food? Goes without saying, it's CRAVE worthy. This is a new location, so I expected the usual growing pains. But overall, a great dining experience. Welcome to the neighborhood, SOL Cocina!~~#~1
That darn Smokehouse burger is awesome. 5 stars. The smoked corn was a little Meh... it was oily like not butter oily... not a huge fan of the texture either. I like corn crunchy and it was not. Service was great. I did see an unmentionable bug running around near the back entrance towards the chicken rotisserie thing, but bugs have to eat too right? (still 5 stars lol)~~#~1
My friend kept telling me how good their lunches are... I tried it, but it didn't do anything for me.  The sandwich tasted like something you can get at Safeway, but twice the price.  For being called a Purveyor of Fine Foods, I expected the food to taste like not just any ordinary sandwich. What I had:Ham, cheese with portobello mushrooms on a panini with 2 sides of pasta, one was parmesan and the other was macaroni. Maybe it was the panini bread. I think the parmesan pasta was made there, but I know for sure the macaroni was not made there, it tasted like something I had at a picnic which was in a carton. It wasn't anything to brag home about. I found out the head chef made my sandwich... keep him in the kitchen and away from the customers, no personality whatsoever. I asked for his suggestion, and his reaction was "anythings good." Normally, when I go to AJ's, I go for their desserts. Their desserts are fabulous and you can get individual servings at a reasonable price.  I can take an assortment home and have them for later. Our company does use them for their catering and I've had many compliments on their dishes, but pass on the lunches.~~#~1
Very friendly and knowledgeable guys.~~#~1
The florist manager is great, but i have not had a great experience with the night manager.  He seemed upset that i was stopping him from tidying the shelves to ask about putting an order in for flowers.  He said he had no clue how to order flowers and could not help me. I would need to come in and speak to the Florist Manager in the morning..... Well I work and i wanted to order flowers as a surprise thats why i was there in the evening. thought it was odd.~~#~0
Came for a friend's birthday and really was not that impressed. First of all, it took us a while to find parking as this place only has street parking and a few spots in back. On Saturday if you are there before 7pm, all alcohol was 1/2 off and some appetizers were on special. We ate dinner there and the menu was very limited. The food was okay, but our burgers were over cooked. The service was slow and it took us a while to get our check. I'd go to hang out again and have a few drinks, but I wouldn't suggest making this your regular hang out.~~#~0
Too bad about Mandalay Noodle World. Maybe if they had stressed better service and played up the Burmese aspect they would have had better luck. Who knows?Betito's moved in, and they're okay. The wife and I stopped in yesterday. I had a carne asada torta and a taco and both were about average. Their hot salsa took it up a notch though. My wife had something with diablo in the name (sorry, I'll have to look at the menu when I get home) and loved it. They do the usual menudo on weekends and the whole place is more or less along the lines of a Filiberto's--not that there's anything wrong with that. The whole bill was less that $20, so prices are good. Clean enough place, cheap, food is okay, and service is adequate. I would not go out of my way to get there, but if it is in your neighborhood it is worth a try. I'll probably stop here from time to time.~~#~0
I have been here several times now and have never had a bad experience yet.  Good food, good service; no complaints.   Still have never made it here for happy hour, but their specials during that time seem like quite a deal.  The staff are always friendly and seem to remember us from one visit to another.  I've only ever eaten sushi here, but they have a lot of other menu items that I would like to try at some point, but I always turn to the sushi as it has always been good and fresh.  I would recommend trying this restaurant.~~#~1
Affordable and good.  Clean restaurant.  Will return.~~#~0
Absolutely horrendous.  This post office will lose your mail (repeatedly), laugh about it to your face, lie about it, blow it off, make it seem like it's your fault and make you wish you had sent it UPS.~~#~1
I'm from Chicago so I'm picky with my pizza--this place does it right (NY style)! I love the "hole in the wall" feel. Every customer that walked in was a regular which was a good sign. I ordered the Mozzarella sticks and a large Monster Pie (Sausage, pepperoni, bell peppers, onion and cheese). The mozzarella sticks took a little while to come out but they were cooked to perfection. They also threw in a few garlic knots which was awesome. The pizza was unbelievable--I think the crumbled sausage really did it! They have great deals like large pie & 20 wings for $20 which I definitely will be taking advantage of during football games on Sunday. Glad to have found a new place where I can also be a regular!~~#~1
Other than the really great happy hour prices, its hit or miss with this place. More often a miss. :(The food is less than average, the drinks NOT strong ( at least they are inexpensive) , but the service is truly hit or miss.I'll pass.~~#~1
Service was faster than some of the other (but better) Indian restaurants I have been to in the area. The food was so-so. Nothing special. I enjoy spicy Indian food, but the "hot" was not. The only reason we ate there was the buy one get one free in the Phoenix area coupon book... no that, was a good value.~~#~0
Perhaps it was foolish for me to give La Condesa only four stars at first, given the fact that I really liked it.  What can I say?  I'm critical by nature.  I knew I was going back soon, so I felt like I had to save the last for a return visit.  Well, it just got it.This place is fantastic.  In fact, if CenPho lets this one go under, I will personally hold all of you responsible; watch out for a citizen's arrest if I ever see you.  However, that is unlikely to happen, because the food is damn tasty.  Today, the Oaxaca black mole chicken taco had me swooning, topped with pickled onions; the chicken is tender and simmered in the lovely sauce.  The Soronan carne asada taco, char-grilled over mesquite charcoal is no slouch either; I'd rate it right up there with some of my favorites in town.  Go to this place; I have a feeling I'll be here at least weekly.  When and if they ever get a beer/liquor license...probably more.~~#~1
Great place for brunch or to relax with a coffee. Their hot chocolate is amazing.~~#~1
I have been through plenty of airports around the world and I have to say that this one is on the better end. It is easy to navigate, clean (from what I have experienced), and makes getting to and returning rental cars a breeze. As in most airports, those who are not used to recent travel REALLY hold up the security check line. I would think they would want to be prepared and get through that check as quickly as possible and I held my breath when one young lady came back out in search of a 1 quart zip lock bag, fearing that we would have to evacuate the terminal for her breech, but we were all able to make our flights. A word to pet lovers who insist on traveling with their four-legged friends: allergies and asthma plague a large number of people and difficulty breathing caused by YOUR pet presents an unexpected glitch in their travel day. PLEASE CONSIDER LEAVING YOUR PETS AT HOME. An unplanned trip to the ER as a result of YOUR inconsideration should be YOUR responsibility. What do you say about that, health care providers??? In all my travels, this has been the only time I have been stuck behind the hairiest cat I have ever seen in my life because its owners had more baggage than humanly possible to manage. Clueless to others distress as the owners, their pet left wheezing, sneezing, itching, gasping travelers in its wake. Are you from Naperville?~~#~0
Been here for many years but have seen a recent decline in quality service. Felt scolded by the bartender today at lunch. Felt disrespected as a customer. Service sucks stay away. "bad service = bad review"~~#~1
Hands down the best breakfast I've ever had, anywhere. It definitely feels like home cooked breakfast. I've never been to this place on the weekend when it isn't packed out the door. I'm not the only person that loves this place!~~#~1
This is simply a poor substitute for the Los Dos Molinos in South Phoenix.  It is a pale shade of itself.  The salsa is spicy, but it doesn't have any of the same excitement.  I think its partly the downtown location in a strip mall, (not that 98% of restaurants in Phoenix aren't in strip malls).  But the Mexcian Pizza and Chicken enchiladas just didn't have the same loving kick and spice.  When you are craving Mexican downtown, this'll do in a pinch.  But make room and time to head out to the original deal, the one with 5 alarm salsa and huge patios.  Margaritas the size of one's head and bring a group of friends to indulge!~~#~0
This place is fantastic!We went in on Sunday the 29th of July around 5:00pm. The guy behind the counter told us to enjoy ourselves, take our time, ask if we had any questions. We wandered around for a bit, I found a bottle of Argyle bubbly that I wanted, and then began to stare with lust in my eyes at the selection of Absinthe. Girlfriend wandered over to ask the guy to recommend a white that wasn't a Chard as we both really don't like buttery oak anything. He took a few cues from her, and found a great bottle of white which we drank with great glee last night. This was a test for the guy behind the counter. She didn't set a price limit, just said "show me your favorite." He could have done what many others have in the past and shown us a $50 bottle, but instead he showed us a kick ass bottle at the $14 price point. This is the mark of a good wine seller. Find you what you want without bending you over on the price. Yes, sometimes I want to spend $400 a bottle, but not all that often. I'd rather get my drink on at the price he found, and he turned us onto a white we both REALLY liked, which is super rare as we have very different tastes.We'll absolutely be going back to buy more fermented grape from this place!Prices are on par with Total Wine, but what you're really paying for is the help of someone who knows what they sell and likes their job. Great job Sportsman's, see you next Sunday for afternoon drinking!~~#~1
I'm torn.I LOVED my $20 facial. I'll probably go back for more once Groupon and the like run out of deals.However, I also got a brow and eyelas tinting.  I wouldn't recommend that service from here.  My brows were uneven, and my lashes faded out quicker than normal.~~#~0
Recently moved back to Mesa, I have been on the hunt for a place to get a good sandwich and fresh bread. This place now tops my list of places in the East Valley to get a good sandwich. My first sandwich was the Atlantic Haddock Provencal. A sandwich made with seared, lightly breaded haddock, sliced hard-boiled egg, fresh basil, romaine lettuce, tomato, Provencal tartar sauce on a grilled Brioche roll. The brioche was amazing. It was light and fluffy. The haddock was perfectly cooked with just the right amount of breading, and the vegetables were fresh and in perfect proportions as to not overpower the bread and haddock. Sometimes when you go to a sandwich shop they overload it with everything else that the meat and bread are just there to accessorize the vegetables and sauce. This was perfectly done. The atmosphere is pleasant and open with nice music as the light smell of fresh bread in the background salivates me. This is a must-visit lunch time destination. Dinner review shortly.~~#~1
What a wonderful night. It didn't start out that way. I found this restaurant on yelp, not realizing that it was sixteen miles from the hotel my wife and i were staying at. I heard the grief all the way there. "Come on honey, it's an adventure!". We arrived, and were greeted warmly and shown right to our table. Zach, our waiter, was right there to offer us drinks and appetizers. We had the Summer Rolls and they were delicious! I explained to  Zach that I was allergic to wheat and he brought us a special "gluten free" menu the owner had created for those of us who are allergic to wheat. Zach even brought us some special wheat-free dipping sauce for the Summer rolls. He showed great care, provided great customer service,  and the sauce  was delicious!The portions were good sized and the presentation was beautiful. But the wonderful tastes and personal service made the night special. Oh, the bathrooms were clean too. Thanks Zach, and thanks Malee's. It was a great night my wife and I look forward to repeating. (Yes, she admitted after dinner that the drive was worth it.)~~#~1
I met up with a few ladies here for drinks a few weeks back at the suggestion of someone else. We didn't end up playing pool, just enjoyed our drinks at the bar before moving over to a table. We were definitely over dressed and probably out of place, but it was a chill place to let loose. Drinks were okay, food was nothing outstanding, prices were to be expected.~~#~0
I am a way more frequent visitor of the bell rd location, but sometimes I have to travel downtown for work. When I do, I make my route pass by this place because I have to have dutch bros.  The guys at the bell location are pretty familiar with me by now but these guys still treat you as if you are there best customer. And it's the best coffee I've ever had.~~#~1
Even more great news....on Tuesdays there is a special of 35c per ounce. Not that I needed another incentive...but this is GREAT.~~#~1
Where to begin?This is my favorite Mexican food establishment ever. I've been frequenting Carolina's for years and never once have I been disappointed. Some might compare it to Filiberto's or any of those [insert surname here]berto's but this is on a whole different level.Atmosphere-wise it's one step above a sketchy hole-in-the-wall but the food makes up for everything the appearance of the place lacks. I don't know their secret but their beans, the tortillas, the salsa... it's all to die for. And IT'S. SO. CHEAP. Like, seriously, I'd dish out more money for this food but the fact that it really is that cheap is the icing on the cake. It's almost always busy but it's always worth the wait. Always.If you haven't gone... you're missing out.~~#~1
I just got back from an Arizona spring training vacation, and one of the highlights was definitely the Desert Botanical Gardens.  We came really close to skipping on a visit altogether because it was 5:00pm, but decided to give it a shot...it was worth it!  I was a little disappointed that the Butterfly Pavillion had closed for the day at 5:00pm, and several walking areas were being used for weddings/receptions (who could blame these people??) but still got to see a lot of beautiful desert plants and wildlife.  We managed to get in for free, not sure if it was because of the time of the day or all the people just walking in for the weddings though, which totally made the park that much more fun.  I am not sure I would have gotten as much enjoyment out of it if I'd had to pay $5 to get in...The little desert rat-sqirrels, and rabbits were totally fun to try to find hiding in the many different plants and burrows.  I felt like a little kid ooh-ing and ah-ing at the different varieties of cacti and desert wildflowers, and have to give this place the ultimate rating .  If you're ever in Arizona, please give this place a try, it's very well put together and a beautiful site to see.~~#~1
Being Indian, and having grown up in London, I have been pretty spoilt for Indian food. Imagine my dismay when I moved to Phoenix! I've tried many different places here in town desperately trying to recapture the memory of a good London curry house but each time I've left either disappointed or clutching my guts fearing what may come.Couple of friends introduced me to this place a few months ago and I'm stoked. It's not as good as the stuff back home. And I'm sure you can get better in San Francisco or New York. But if you are looking for something closer to home you can't go wrong.Plus its got the real live Indians eating in there too. Can't be bad!!~~#~1
This place is not there anymore.~~#~1
Gaylee is great! She is super sweet and so professional! Her work is amazing. I found her through one of those online deals and now I am convinced that I will never go elsewhere. Keep up the great work!~~#~1
No frills.  Nothing fancy.  Just some honest burritos and tacos.  Voted "best taco" by New Times a few years back (in the 90's).  Not sure I agree, but they consistently satisfy.  They make a hearty breakfast burrito too.  If you're looking for Sonoran or Tex-Mex or anything beyond what you might find at Filiberto's, try somewhere else.  The red burro combo is my personal favorite.  It's saucy (enchilada style) and just spicy enough.  Bottled beer available.~~#~0
Rarely do I give a 1 star rating but after four attempts in four months to get my fax line and internet rolling I can honestly say they have earned this.  After finally showing up for a scheduled appointment the tech told us our internet was fine but we disagree because we are getting the same speed we had with Qwest in Cave Creek (SLOW)  and they are charging us $64 a month for what they call the upgraded 20mbs.  Furthermore, I tried to send out a couple faxes after he left and the line is not responding.  Im going to drive down to the store tomorrow and demand that they remove the fees for service I have not received and just get efax.  As I noted in the first review we were excited to upgrade to faster internet so that makes this experience even worse.~~#~1
Service was good, however my fettucine alfredo with meatballs was just OK. I would pass on this menu item the next and try something different.~~#~0
Ok, so I'm catching up on past-due reviews.  For me, Chipotle is one of those places you go to when you want something to eat from critters that have been decently treated while giving their life for your enjoyment.  And the food is ok too.  The guacamole is always fresh, the burrito's are big and there are lot's of add-ins.  Just don't expect any gustatory excitation, it's pretty basic, non-threatening, and I think I heard somebody refer to it as gabacho mexican food.  I think that pretty well sums it up.  However, a big plus is that the iced tea is always fresh and all-you-can-drink :-)~~#~0
The praise and worship with Pastor BJ just sets up a God Filled service with the charismatic and awesome Pastor Maiden ... Going the Past 18 months has made our Marriage Stronger and Faith Magical~~#~1
I come here probably at least once a week. The prices are right, there's a good variety of "ethnic" food, the cashiers are quick and friendly, and they're just helpful. I locked myself out of my car when having a space-cadet moment and they let me use their phone to call AAA to bail me out. Fresh flowers + great selection of wine and cheese + all the essentials They deal is that they cut out the middle man to get great prices for quality products and they don't have sales because they always sell their products at the best price possible. =) GO TJ'S!~~#~1
I have only gotten the cafe sua da (iced coffee) here but it's the best I have had yet. When you walk in there is always fresh coffee lined up in cups on the counter ready to be mixed with sweetened condensed milk. I don't get to Mesa often but when I do I go here for the wonderful, rich, dark and creamy coffee. This is strong stuff; that first sip is so good. The richness, full flavor, creamy caramel flavors are heavenly.  And as the ice melts, it mellows out the flavor a little and it's still great. I can't say I have had all the cafe sua da in the valley, but what I have had; this is my favorite. Next time I come to Mesa for work I will need to come at lunch time so I can try the pho.~~#~1
Only had a chance to experience the Oscuro (amber lager) and the pizza (the Arizona vs. Boston) so far but it's enough to make me want to come back and try more.Lots of flat screens. Should be a great place to spend a Sunday afternoon watching footbal in the fall.~~#~0
Hippies scare me.     So in my preparation to go to this place I ordered Xanax from an on-line Canadian pharmacy, which I have been taking for three days now.  Bought a tazer from Spy Headquarters in case one of them tries to hold me down and pours patchouli oil on me.  The fifth of gin that I slammed in the parking lot really helped with that last bit of extra courage that I needed to partake my journey into hippie-land.It was all for nothing. No hippies around, just a teenager behind the counter.  This place is tiny and the counters are about at mouth level. I don't know how anyone under 7'6" could easily eat off of them.  Anyways for $5 flat, you get a kick ass burger, a school lunch bag half full of well seasoned skin-on fries, and a can of soda.   It's true that the fries could have been a bit more crispy but they tasted so good I got over it real quick.I'd be afraid to ask what the special ingredient is because they might say "it's organic, don't panic".  Jerry's dead, but this place lives on.  Thanks hippies!~~#~1
In addition to the nice atmosphere on the patio they serve a very nice brunch menu and the $2 bloody marys are a buy. Downside: parking validation is only a discount, not a freebie. Depending on when you go the service can be slow. During a recent happy hour the barmaid herself was left to tend to all bar patrons and the patio.~~#~0
Man, do I LOVE a restaurant with REALLY GOOD food and friendly service! Liberty Market is definitely that! Funny thing is that I was originally going to eat at Joe's Farm Grill, but ended up here (after a search here on YELP).Nice laid back decor too.You wait in line to place your order, pay, and they give you a stand with a number on it (like at Sizzler), then someone brings your order.I like places that spend the time to make their own salad dressings and take care with creating a delicious salad. The Italia was DELICIOUS and a perfect size! The homemade Minestrone soup was loaded with fresh ingredients and was REALLY fantastic too!I forgot to try one of their desserts...the last Red Velvet cupcake was ALMOST snatched up by another customer, but the Food Server was so kind to offer to get it to me (maybe I had a look of panic on my face??)...WOW!! This service is rare to find!The restrooms are quite amusing! Saw a similar set-up in NYC. Each toilet/water-closet is individual...no stalls. They were VERY CLEAN too (ok, I was seriously apprehensive that it might smell like a men's restroom, since it was all unisex...no worries!!!!)I can't wait to visit here again...but, after I check out their other place across the street: Joe's Real BBQ. YUM!~~#~1
Great experience from start to finish.  Host (who was the owner) seated us at a table with a view.  Was given house made foccacia bread and olive oil.  Was awesome.  Some of the best bread I've ever had before a meal.  The olive oil was seasoned perfectly too.  My grandma got the burger and I got the pesto penne primavera.  The pasta came with shrimp, squash, and some other vegetables.  I love pesto, so this hit the spot.  Good serving size, but not too much.  The food tasted fresh.  They make their own pasta, which was delicious.  The burger was huge.  Looked like you get your moneys worth.  The ice tea was even good.  The place was clean and sleek.  They played good music and the service was perfect.  It has been a while since I had such a good overall experience with no complaints.  I will be coming back.  The host, who we later found out was the owner, was working that night and asked us how we liked everything.  I've said it before, but that is a rare and good touch for any restaurant.  Well done.~~#~1
Great customer service, competitive rates, and I always get a call right back from Jeff! Nice to have an agent who actually cares about his customers. I would recommend giving him a call.~~#~1
We went to The Farm today for lunch to enjoy a picnic on such an awesome beautiful day. I had the Tuscan sandwich and it was awesome. I had expected it to be good but was surprised at just how enjoyable it really was. I'm sure sitting outside in beautiful surroundings on a perfect day helped with the experience. This is the prefect place for lunch on a beautiful day. My date was equally impressed so I'm sure I will be back!~~#~1
Screw Disneyland- Sephora is the happiest place on earth!  They have everything a girly girl or a girly guy could possibly dream of and then some! They have all the best brands in cosmetics, skin care and perfume and they're always adding new items to their extensive product selection.  To me, getting a gift card to Sephora is like having Christmas morning over and over again.  Everywhere you look there are sparkly blushes, lip plumping glosses, lash-extending mascaras and anti-aging face creams- what more could anyone ask for? I can understand why men might hate going into Sephora- but they do have some products for guys too- although not many.  As far as I know, Scottsdale Fashion Square is home to the only Sephora in Scottsdale, but even as great as it is, it still can't beat the one right on the strip in Vegas.  They're open really late and you can shop with a drink in your hand- what could be better than that?~~#~1
I loved this little slice of heaven.  Reasonable prices, tiny dining room, very personal service.  Pablo was laid back, but with only 4 couples in the small establishment, he did a great job of making sure we were taken care of.~~#~1
What a load of absolutely hideous, uninteresting crap.Take every single one-star review written by Yelpers below, copypaste them here and you will have a far more eloquent summary of my feelings on this place than anything I can come up with.I have no reason to ever come here. Certainly not free will. The one time I did come here I was forced to by a friend who was meeting another friend.~~#~1
AZ-88 is at once chic, urban, fun, and just enough Scottsdale without making me want to stab myself in the face, as a t-shirt-and-jeans-wearing, overweight guy.You'll first notice the atmosphere, and with good reason--it's perfectly lit, with noticeable but not mind-numbingly blaring music, and even better, they have a live DJ who goes through no small trouble to beat match and keep things rolling throughout your Wednesday-Saturday evening dining experience. When I first hit AZ-88, it had an enormous deconstructed NY taxicab suspended from the ceiling which was a fantastical conversation piece. The wall behind the bar was completely covered in names and numbers. (I was far too proud when I accurately guessed that they were the names of cabbies and the numbers were their license numbers.) Overall, a very different, fun look.Comfortable chairs and very full cocktails abound, and while they typically have a rock-steady delivery, more than a little cosmo has ended up in my friend's purse, to her chagrin. That aside, the food is fantastic and even though it's a bit hard to get out of here for under $30 per person (because you simply must try the cheesecake, and drinks are pushing $14), it's worth it as a classy-but-casual night out that you can really enjoy.They have a great patio, the burger is dripping with flavor (and, in fact, cheese), and they have waffle fries with pretty much everything. Great salads and sandwiches help round things out, and they ship their cheesecake in from Carnegie Deli in New York which is just about the most perfect cheesecake you'll have the good chance to try. Forget that Cheesecake Factory nonsense, these people know how a cheesecake is done. It is rich, thick, with just a hint of sour, and an amazing flavor that takes your tongue hostage and demands whipped cream ransom.Overall, a wonderful place for drinks and good food with friends, and the staff is pointed but efficient and will throw back any shit you give them, in good humor or, as appropriate, not. (We've never run afoul of that rule, but you wouldn't want to, I assure you.)~~#~1
Sugar bowl ice cream is yummy but what ice cream isn't? let's just say if one day I was craving ice cream, I wouldn't think of coming here specifically for theiiir tubs. Very average stuff.. similar to Breyers/ Dryers. What I diiid like was the price, their abundant seating area and location (=~~#~0
Other then the chips and salsa (5 stars for salsa) the food is good, but not so much that I go out of my way to eat there. The fajitas are delish, with mushrooms and the meat always tender, but the price makes me cringe. At over $20 there are so many other places I rather eat. I usually opt for a cheese crisp with green onions and green chilies and a side of guacamole (which is always yummy but pricey) and I still pay for all that $15 plus what ever we are drinking.... I love the overly rustic atmosphere, but it really could use some updating and maybe a good scrub.... Some of the servers are not the friendliest, but these are mostly the family that work there and have been there forever, so don't take it personally....But overall it is a Scottsdale landmark that is fun to bring out of towers to and the food is overall good.~~#~0
Fun, with caps if I did that sort of thing. The whole experience was great (you won't get any specifics, this review is 3 weeks after, I can't remember, sorry). Service was by that waitress who does everything perfectly. Explain food, wine, doesn't stay too long. Nice interesting big room decor. Looking forward to the next time.~~#~1
Who dosen't like Cosco, I love this place. The pizza is cheap and good.~~#~1
A group of us from the IVAA Summit went to Zinburger last night. The food & service was great! I think we scared our poor server (Mike), but he was wonderful!~~#~1
I love this restaurant (even though it's a chain and I can hear my brother saying it's just a "glorified Red Lobster"). I ordered the Crab and Lobster Bisque soup and am drooling thinking about how much I wish I could eat it right now. For my entree I ordered the Atlantic Salmon (stuffed with crab, shrimp, and brie cheese) which was unbelievably amazing. I also had some scalloped potatoes which was basically in the shape of a brick covered with cheesy goodness. I wanted to eat the apple pie for dessert because it looked so delicious, but could barely breathe after eating all that food. The service was outstanding, although the manager stopping by the table several times throughout dinner was annoying. I can't wait to come back here.~~#~1
On one of my many visits to see mi amore, he took me to this fantastic little pizza joint. The aesthetics of the place were overwhelmingly perfect. I believe the maximum seating capacity of the dining area is 45, yes folks, 45. So the 2 1/2 hour wait was expected, and very VERY worth it. The pizzas are baked to order in a classic brick house oven. The toppings arent what youd find in your local Pizza Hut, either. You can choose from fresh slices of mozzarella, slices of perfectly seasoned italian sausage, pepperoni slices, salami slices, arugula, fresh basil leaves, tomatoes, etc. Basically what Im getting at, is this is beyond words delicious, classic LEGIT Italian pizza. Around the dining area, you will see freshly baked loaves of focaccia bread, that is later served to you with extra virgin olive oil for dipping once you are seated. The smell in that place is heavenly.....incredibly reminiscent of my grandmothers kitchen!!PS GET THERE EARLY!!~~#~1
The pizza is my favorite in Phoenix.  It is light, airy and tasty and does not give you that "I am reading to explode as my cotton mouth is making me drink two liters of water every half hour" feeling.The ingredients are fresh and delicious.  I am hooked!~~#~1
Wednesday 7pm.  This place is your average over priced, lack of taste chain food restaurant and this place was no different. I have to say, I was super disappointed as I have always heard rave reviews, now I'm starting to question who I associate with and their taste in food.Service=slow.Food=just tastes like saltNoise=loud and they do a dance...like a lot.Go somewhere else and skip Joe's Crabs.~~#~1
They serve breakfast all day, which is always a plus.  I had the tomato soup with grilled cheese.  The bread was delcious, tasted homemade.  However, there was way too much cheese, and it wasn't fully melted.  My g/f had the eggs benedict, which looked really good.  She said it was really good, and filling.  3 stars.  I've had better.  I've had worse.  La de da.~~#~0
I want to like Turf, but the food is just okay.  I've only been here twice, but it was not mind-blowing.I'm not fond of the shepherd's pie here.  It is the most bland version I have had... even in this town.  The wings, however, are pretty good.  I've eaten wings here with a couple Harps and have had a decent time.Surprisingly good is their seared ahi tuna.  It is pretty weird to think an Irish pub would do this well, but they do.  A friend ordered it and after shaking my head and saying there's no way it could be good, I tried a bite and I had to eat crow.  Turf is typically a stop on the pub crawl, so I will definitely be back again for boozing.~~#~0
I had not been to an Oregano's in like 10 years. They seems to be popping up all over here in AZ now so my buddy was in from out of town and he wanted to try, so why not.I'll tell you "Why NOT"... we has two thin crust pizzas... and I even hate to call them that. More like... crackers with melted cheese and some toppings.That was some of the worst excuse for pizza I've ever had. Most of the fast-food delivery pizza I've had beats it -- and I do not like, at all, delivery pizza.Maybe the pan pizza is better than the thin crust... god it could not be worse!It only deserves one star for the good service... other than that is the another sub-par overpriced "gourmet" pizza joint.If you want expensive, and good, pizza there are many good alternatives... Pizzeria Bianco, Grimaldi's, etc.~~#~1
I was a regular at Mia's first location in Wrigleyville/Chicago. Scott (the original founder/chef and present owner) is the reason Mia Francesca is what it is. Not sure if us folks up here in Scottsdale know how lucky we are he landed on our door step. Food, service, vibe...if I could give it six stars I would.~~#~1
Excellent service and food           enjoyed live music on patio~~#~1
Love Krista!~~#~1
nice location , good service but a little slow. been here twice so far and both times the food i would give 4 stars but both times they screwed up our orders and burger was cold, they did take off 20 percent for the issue and that was nice.. overall i enjoy the food and would go back.~~#~0
I attended one of her classes for pressure cookers, and had to leave with one. Luckily, she offers great discounts after her classes!Since then I have also gotten a bosch mixer (don't know how I lived without one all these years!) and also a wheat grinder. Everytime I go in here I find something I can't live without!Shar has great classes, and tips on how to utilize all her products. Well worth it to attend a class. I just wish the store was closer to Glendale!So glad I found shar's, now my family enjoys homemade wheat bread and pizzas and all sorts of yummy things that are good for them too!~~#~1
I have either an extreme LOVE or DISLIKE for this place. More love, though. Things I love: Great wine, with all different price points, which is nice. Cool, speakeasy atmosphere. Great bands and entertainment. Great cheese platter and flat breads. Good prices. Things I do not love: Service. Are you a bouncer? A bartender? Are you leading me to a seat? can you get me a seat? Its confusing. The staff is not clearly defined (not only do they not wear uniforms, or name tags, but they are scarce and hard to find) The mix. It is kind of a random mix. I guess that can be a good thing, but I was there once and it was like Spring Break in Cabo, and then the other time, it was like 50+ snow birds day. Either one is fine, it is just hard to gage when to go and who to bring, like, my mom, or my pals. They serve dessert, but no coffee. That, to me, is just strange. Buy a coffee maker. Sheesh. They have this amazing fondue that would be great with some baileys and coffee, and alas, no coffee. Strange. I know, "wine bar", but if you serve dessert, coffee should go hand in hand. In the end, the place is cool and they have some of the best entertainment there. they ambiance is nice. Go early for a seat, they are hard to come by. Beware of paying $ at the door for an entertainment fee, but it is well worth it.~~#~0
Need fig preserves? They've got it. Fennel? It's beautifully packed on ice and extremely fresh in the produce department. Need boneless pork loin roast from the blade end? The butcher has your back. Duck fat? Just take a peek in the freezer section. Sometimes, it's the little things that normally go unnoticed that gets you five stars...AJ's closed early the other night in lieu of the holidays and I ran around to FOUR different stores looking for something as simple as whole grain mustard and fennel. I came up empty handed on both items. I say "simple" items - but it's amazing when you rely on a grocer like this as much as I do and realize that most items are out of reach otherwise. AJ's carries practically anything my culinary desires could ask for!Although I had to wait a day to go shopping again and to make the recipe i was wanted, it was during my adventures to the 4 stores that I realized how much I truly appreciate this grocer. How is it I can get wireless internet via laptop on the I-10 freeway courtesy of my phone company, but can't find fennel within a 10 mile radius?This my friends, is why I love AJ's. And as someone who watches America's Test Kitchen as though it were food porn, I can say that any other grocer doesn't stand a chance against Eddie Bashas' high end store.You truly do get what you pay for. For all the employees at AJ's I say "THANK YOU!!" for the great service you provide and the products you offer.~~#~1
Love me some hidden house! The music is too loud. The drinks too cheap. The clientele too local. But I've never had anything but a good time there. Whether it's karaoke or weird shit on the weekends you'll have fun if you don't expect it to be Merc, cuz Merc it ain't. And not for one moment in it's life has it pretended to be. But I love it for what it is and that's an experience.~~#~1
Cowboy Ciao is one my favorite restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale.  To start with, they share a wine list with Kazimierz.  My favorite menu item is the Stetson Chopped salad.  My only wish is that the serving was bigger!  I can't get enough...and I'm too embarrassed to order two.  The flavors in this salad are amazing!  Smoked salmon, Israeli cous cous, creamy dressing.For dinner, I actually like the Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry.  The tastes are really unique and I got to try mushrooms I hadn't had before.  It's great!I did try the Bacon Peanut Brittle for dessert and I cannot recommend this.  It was not good at all.  It just makes the brittle really greasy and then you run into chunks of bacon...ick.  Thank God my husband ordered the Chocolate/Peanut Butter pot pie so I could steal from him!~~#~1
Great Mexican food. Authentic street tacos plus a full menu of tasty dishes. Halibut tacos remind me of EnsenadaMichelada with Pacifico beer is a perfect beverage for any dish.~~#~1
I have been graciously reminded by many people that a "bruin" is a kind of bear.Sorry guys... I'm an AZ native (we don't have bears here in Phoenix) with the classic AZ school system education. :)~~#~0
I recently had a shit cleaned at the Intercontinental Hotel in Hong Kong. Not cheap. I only mention that because this place charged MORE to clean that suit - almost $30 for a two-piece suit after they tacked on their $6 "designer brand" surcharge (no, I am not kidding). Despite branding as "green" the suit still reeked of solvent (the green, silica-based solvents have never left an odor in my experience). No differentiation to justify these absurd prices - a lot of good alternatives in the area. Be warned!~~#~1
What a fabulous dining experience! My boyfriend and I are always looking for new places to try and came upon this place on Yelp when our regular Saturday spot decided to no longer be opened for lunch Saturdays. Right upon entering we were greeted by someone behind the register and he sat us down at a booth. The decor was great and the place was spotless. We ordered the Saturday special of Monte Cristo, the potatoes and the biscuits and gravy among other items. The Monte Cristo was perfection and the home made blueberry and strawberry jam was excellent! The potatoes were seasoned to perfection and eggs cooked perfectly. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone and this is now going to be our regular weekend breakfast/brunch place.~~#~1
Where are the managers????   It took 1 1/2 hours for our meal to come out at 8:15 in the evening.  Items came out at different times so we couldn't all eat at the same time.  The asparagus tempura was inedible because they didn't cut the ends.  Waitress just took it away and did not comp us.  Waitress knew next to nothing about the sushi menu.  She sat and talked with the hostess the entire time instead of waiting on her tables.  Food was WAY over priced, and I couldn't speak to my dinner companions because the music was way to loud.  One of the worst dining experiences in a long time.  Paid $70 for a dinner for 4 and went home hungry.  HORRIBLE!~~#~1
This place is busy, but the kids love the pancakes so much food for the price.~~#~0
I was sad to come back to lai lai's and they no longer had the Mongolian :( boo,, but i took my mom there and we were starving so we decided to order off the menu. My mom is allergic to  msg and they helped us with what we should order. and she didn't get sick!! woo hoo.. we ordered three dishes and an appetizer to share between her , my bf, and myself, and we stilll brought food home, and I dont think we spent over $30 bucks for all that food!! it was very good to! i love good cheap food!! Ill be back, they are always friendly.~~#~1
Very good. My wife and I stopped by randomly on our way back and had beef pho and veggie pho. I eat large portions and this is the first time ever I didn't finish a bowl of pho. If in the area we will stop again for sure.~~#~1
Probably the most overrated place in the Phoenix area. There pizza tastes way too much like their canned tomato sauce and there is always a wait to be seated. That being said there food overall is OK. There meat salad and cal-zones are good and the servers are friendly. For all the people out there giving it more than 3 stars: try other pizza places like spinatos, la grande Orange, pizzeria Bianca.~~#~0
Alright, so here is my two cents on Brat Haus. I suggest to steer clear of the brats I tried (Beer Brat & Spicy Thai).  I found them a bit dry and bland.  I also found the pretzels less than fabulous. I do suggest to try to big, juicy, tasty, meatballs. Much better choice. The outside patio very cool, an open fresh space with plenty of seating and a big ol' wall of funky art. The service was also friendly, and attentive and fair prices. Overall, it's totally worth checking out if you are in the area and in the mood for something different.~~#~0
Went here today Sunday about 8:50 and it was crowded but not to bad, about 1/2 hour wait. Im warning you now, dont ask how much longer after you put your name in if they told you how long when you checked in. About 10am is when it really got packed, just about when we got done. I ordered the chicken and waffles and i really liked it. I asked for some butter for my waffle because it didnt come with any and it made the dish perfect for me. The chicken had great flavor and when you take a bite with the waffle and butter and the syrup, heaven. I tried some bites without the butter and it wasnt even close to be the same for me. My grandma got some omellete and she gave me some because she knew she wouldnt finish it and i would order that also. The omelletes are pretty good size but my wifes dish, my sons and mine where not that much food especially for $9. We are use to getting enough food for 2 when you eat at breakfast places and slighty cheaper. Not complaining because it was good but be ready. There was 2 guys sitting next to use and trying to eat there 30 minute food challange. big ass egg plate with bacon and hash browns, they both only made thru about halfway.  I would definilty go back and get the same stuff. I also got a lemonade with mint and it was just right. My son really didnt like his reese's pancakes.Id like to go back and try some of this stuff ham steak w/ gravy, chicken fried steak w/ hashbrowns, bannana pecan caramel french toast~~#~1
Love this location at Gainey Ranch! Great food consistently!~~#~1
Our server Gary was awesome. Food was amazing...an experience.~~#~1
We started each morning of our vacation at The Breakfast Club.  Everything was so tasty; juices are fresh-squeezed.  Menu has quite a variety and portions are very filling  It gets busy early.  Be sure to give it a try.~~#~1
I had other piercings done here and then went out of state and got my nose pierced with a friend and when i got back I was having problems with it. I went in and talked to them and they changed out the stud for me gave me a discount on the jewelry and were really fun, friendly, professional and very informative. This place is top notch. Won't go to another place for my piercings again! No way! It is very clean, and these guys know their stuff! Really impressed...I could go on and on! I won't get my jewelry anywhere else either...they have a a great variety and if they don't have something you want they order it, easy peasy. Love it!~~#~1
The food here is awesome every time I come here we have a great time And the waitress kimberly Couldn't ask for better waitress~~#~1
OK, I've decided that other coffee shops sell swill. I think about Dazbog coffee in a dreamy sort of way, like unstressed people think about sex. I mourn often that they open so damn late in the morning. Seriously, I would be there every day... The chocolate cappuccino rocks my world and perks me right the hell up, even on the mushiest afternoon. No bitterness, not overly sweet, just blissful- in an I've-just-been-bitch-slapped-by-caffeine sort of way, of course. Oh, and the sandwiches I complained about? Replaced by real deli looking ones in clam-shells. Far more appetizing. But what the hell do I need a sandwich for when I can have a giant red velvet cupcake? Don't make me break out the voodoo, Dazbog. Just open at 6:00 am like any other coffee shop and we'll be BFFs.~~#~1
What's not to love? Herb n Flavors uses local, high quality ingredients, the food tastes GREAT and they are vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free friendly! I especially liked their vegan spinach and artichoke dip! We will definitely be back soon : )~~#~1
Excellent New Mexico style food, great hatch green chile.~~#~1
We have been to this location to buy gear prior to the Fiesta Bowl.  Yes, things are way overpriced, but that is the premium one pays for licensed merchandise.  One nice thing is that they had a buy one, get one half off deal.  Was nice for our large crew.  Nice selection of NFL, NBA and MLB gear.  Friendly staff, good location.  If you feel the need to buy licensed sports gear when you are in the area, worth the trip.~~#~0
Went here last night with another couple for dinner.  The pitcher of margaritas was spot on, the chips were outstanding along with the guacamole and salsa.  I ordered the tortilla soup which I ended up sending back cuz to be honest it tasted and looked like a bowl of enchilada sauce.  My husband ordered the filet and enchilada which I have to say was cooked perfectly and definitely would order if I ever went back.  The other couple ordered the beef short ribs which I didn't taste but they both agreed it was over cooked. Service was great but when I have to send something back which I rarely do I can't give more then 3 stars.~~#~0
I love this location! The food is always great and the service is good. Wi-fi is a plus especially since I am going to school. I come here almost everyday. I recommend this location to everyone.~~#~1
ok....first let me say that I grew up in PHX. And we used to go for special occasions to "Bobby MaGees" which is where BobbyQ's is now located (says something about the quality of my restaurant experiences as a young fella)...And as cheesy as Bobby McGaees was...i kind of miss the pirate serving me my dinner (and the salad bar in the bathtub).But i do like what they have done to the place. Cool interior. Casual but with a nice upscale feel. The patio seemed really nice (didn't sit out here).We tried a variety of things. A burger, a pulled pork sandwich, brisket, baby backs etc...I think the standout were the ribs. VERY good...very tender (but not overcooked), good sauce.  I enjoyed every one.Everything else was just ok. Like on par with Chili's (which isn't saying much). The sides were pretty tasty. Corn (roasted and then taken off the cob for you) , mashed potatoes, cornbread...all pretty good. Dinner for 4 (2 kids, no booze)...50$.But a 5 star place? Maybe in the context of other restaurants in the Dunlap and I-17 areas (next to crazy Mitch's Furniture barn.) But not in the broader context of PHX.I would definitely go back for ribs...but not a place that will go into the normal rotation.Side note: Hilarious crowd on a Saturday night. Lots of "west side" clubbers...or maybe too old to be clubbers but want to go clubbing (there is a lounge attached).~~#~0
Thank you, Mobile Yelp App!  Without you, I would have been stuck in Phoenix with no idea of where to find Thai food for lunch that was near a Light Rail station in Tempe!I arrived at Thai Rama about 11:15 AM.  On entering, there was no indication of waiting to be served and no one visible from the staff, so I selected a table and sat down.  My waitress came to the table and asked if I would be more comfortable at a 2-seat table instead of the 4-seat table I had selected.  Since there were about 25 available tables of various size, I declined and told her I was comfortable where I sat.  There were 3 other tables active in the restaurant, so I did not anticipate the restaurant needing my 4-top before I was done.The waitress set the lunch specials menu on the table and went to get a glass of water.  The lunch specials menu had 10 options available, but no Som Tom.  I asked the waitress if Som Tom was available and she answered that she did not know what Som Tom was.  She reached for a full menu as I explained that Som Tom is green papaya salad.  She handed me the menu and directed me to the third page for salads.  There, first on the list, Som Tom.I ordered Som Tom, the yardstick by which I measure every Thai restaurant, 10 spicy (5 makes my nose run, 8 makes my forehead sweat and 10 brings tears to my eyes), leaving off the green beans and shrimp, and jasmine rice.  Waitress asked if I wanted anything else to drink, but I said I would stick with water.Ambience here is pretty plain...and the paper napkins are not of the highest quality.  The decor reminded me of a formula-type restaurant like an Applebees or Chili's...with a hispanic flair.  I observed the chef as he came out of the kitchen and made a loop around the dining room.  As he walked by, I asked in Thai how he was doing.  He stopped and replied that the day was starting off slow, but that it would be busy soon enough.  Then, he continued back on to the kitchen after wishing me a good day.About 5 minutes later, my papaya salad was brought to the table.  Portion size was nice, about 2 1/4 cups.  I took a taste and evaluated a 5 spicy.  When the waitress came to ask if I needed anything, I asked for more chili and lime.  She returned quickly with red chili pepper and sliced lime.  I doctored up the order and fell to with a gusto.  For the price, adequate.  Jasmine rice was about a cup, and not too sticky.  The waitress was good about keeping my water glass full...and in Phoenix, that is important!On completing my lunch, I sat and waited for the waitress to bring my bill.  I saw no one for about 10 minutes, then the chef came out of the kitchen and made another round of the dining room.  He asked me (in English) if I enjoyed my salad.  I answered in Thai that it was not spicy enough, and I was surprised he was using red chili instead of Thai chili.  He chuckled and replied that Thai chili was a little more expensive.  I asked for my check and he said he would send the waitress out.For the convenience, outstanding!  For the next experience, I will be sure the chef sees me before I place my order.  For the wait on the bill, a little too long.~~#~0
Awesome country club. Great new remodled gym, heated Olympic pool for year round use.  Love the family like atmosphere, plenty of planned family events/pool parties. Only complaint, wish members who didn't pay for the monthy tennis membership could still rent a court on a need by need basis.   Regardless courts are top notch, great facilities and friendly staff.~~#~1
This is probably the sweet I crave the most! Salted Butter Caramel! Yummmm! When I cant make it up to Scottsdale, I stop by my local Whole Foods in Chandler and pick up a pint from the freezer section and it is just as good.~~#~1
This was the first real ballet I have ever been to, and I was so excited it was the Nutcracker! I have been wanting to see the Nutcracker for years. Thanks to Lindsey and Yelp, I had the opportunity to go and the performance was just stunning. When I walked in, I noticed the lobby was beautifully decorated, a gentleman reading a story to children and a ballet dancer posing for pictures. The bartenders we bought our drinks from, was very friendly and accomodating. I can't say enough about how beautiful the performance was from the dancers, the sets, the costumes, etc. Just incredible. I may just take my daughter to see it with me this season....~~#~1
The server could have been better. She spilled a coke on my lap. This made me late for my movie. The wait was so-so however the food was cooked to my liking. I will go back.~~#~0
Still quite poor both in service and food. maybe I made a mistake and ordered Sichuan Gong Bao ji ding for what seemed like people from canton district. Unfortunately to get the good service U have to speak Mandarin/Cantonese. I do speak a smattering but try not to use it as I never feel confident about the intonation. The dish came out with zichini and bell peppers (what!??)  Where is the peanuts the dried fried red peppers and the large pieces of scallion. On pointing this out all I got was " Oh you like peanuts.. ok I will put some on" and she then proceeded to get some peanuts and sprinkle it on the chicken.Well at that point I was happy that atleast the chicken pieces were present else she would probably end up sprinkling raw chicken pieces on it like the raw peanuts she dumped on top of the food. Well then  I spoke a few chinese words and the scowl turned into a smile and she then became a bit more friendlier. Unfortunately I do not condone this type of behavior. It is all in poor taste...~~#~1
I had a hankering for raw fish today and decided to give Moto a try.  Overall I was pleased.The menu had a wide variety of tempting Asian treats but I was here for fish, so I ordered the sashimi combo with a bowl of Miso.The soup was a bit odd.  It seemed to be normal Miso soup with some shredded cabbage tossed in.  The cabbage added a texture that I didn't really want but it was easy to eat around it.The presentation of the sashimi was interesting.  I had a pinwheel of fishy goodness with yellowtail, smoked salmon and tuna.  The fish tasted quite fresh and the portions were generous.When I need a sushi fix for lunch I'll be returning to Moto.~~#~0
Great service~~#~1
My favorite Starbucks in Mesa. It's not even the closest one to my home, but worth the experience. GREAT staff.~~#~1
I love this place! Great flavors, love the tiny gummy bear toppings.One thing I don't like is the inconsistent hours. One day they'll be open at 8, the next time they close at 7:30. When our yogurt craving hits, we'd love to patronize Woody's, but never know if they're going to be open.I tried over and over to call one night, and the phone was just constantly busy. A little frustrating!I do enjoy their yogurt, but with the weird hours, and so-so feel from the staff it's hard to give them more than 3 stars.~~#~0
First, I hope La Fonda management reads these reviews and takes steps to improve their restaurant.  Second, we miss the bloody mary bar too.  Hubby & I visited LF a few weeks ago on a Saturday night for dinner. We asked the waitress a general question about a beer and she made something up that was ridiculously wrong.  Okay, she doesn't know beer.  We liked the chips & salsa, it was a good start, then I took a sip of my water.  What the?  I know what Tempe tap water tastes like, but this was weird.  The aftertaste made me cringe, I couldn't drink it, even with a slice of lemon in it, maybe it was the ice.  Hubby ordered chicken enchiladas, which he orders practically everywhere, and it was so bad he didn't finish it.  My meal was not memorable either.  I wanted to love this place, or at least like it.  We walked out of there terribly disappointed, I doubt we'll go back.~~#~1
This is a nothing but pies place...so I was expecting a little bit more oomph...Dispointing small selection of pie by the slices...also you gotta put in special order ahead of time for the more interesting stuff like Italian Ricotta.  I was going to order something with berries, but the stuff I saw in the case was just runny and wet looking...so I ended up with a black-bottom pie...I really liked the flaky crust and the filling wasn't bad except for the fact that it did taste a bit over refrigerated.  A minor gripe is the airpot coffee...not freshly brewed...despite the espresso machine clearly visibile behind the counter.The pies are just over $4 per slice and ~$20 per pie.~~#~0
I'd say I've been to the Clubhouse a few times a year over the past five years or so. Does that make me the most knowledgeable person on the venue? By all means, no. But, there are some very common themes among the shows I've seen here, even though the artists were different genres, different, crowds, and even different times of year. The sound quality is terrible. The last three bands that I have seen there (and have seen in other venues as well) all complained that they couldn't get the sound right on their monitors or in the house. To me, that's a major turn off, if the band isn't happy with their sound, are they going to be very motivated to play? Maybe it's a slighted observation, but it seems that the only bands that return to this venue, are the ones that play music, where the sound quality isn't...let's say "sacrificed or as important" (metal, hardcore, thrasher, hip-hop, whatever you call it). The venue is also hot. I don't read the reviews of others, before I review a location, because I don't want my opinions to be skewed, but I noticed someone said, "don't wear pants," honestly, that's a really good tip. The last show I saw here was in June. I know, it's Phoenix, in the summer, suck it up. But when you exit the venue and it is noticeably and significantly "cooler" than inside the venue, we've got issues, can they not afford to run the a/c? The answer to that question is, maybe not. The bar is understaffed, and patrons seem to be lined up 3+ deep, all around. Sometimes you've got to spend money to make money. Hire more bartenders, customers get served faster, thus allowing them more time to consume the beverage and purchase more. That means you can sell more, which means you will make more money! What a concept. Hate to just destroy a business, but hopefully they will heed the feedback constructively. Until then, remember: if you've always wanted to hear the artist you are going to see in a low-fi format, here's your chance, if you have always wanted to forgo wearing those pantaloons, I support you, and finally, you should craft a clever way to hide a flask, since you won't get served, although this might be difficult sans bottoms.~~#~1
I liked the tortillas:  handmade, rich and salty.  I thought the food was decent.  I thought service was okay.  I am not new to Mexican food, I know what I want:  when I say I want cheese and cilantro and tomatillo salsa,  please give it to me.  They charged me and extra dollar for had smattering of queso fresca.  Boo.  I liked the mango-pineapple aqua, super sweet and clean flavor.  I would go back, maybe.~~#~0
Not that any SBUX is worth going out of your way for, but this one is worth skipping. The service I've experienced each time I've been is pretty dang poor and the drinks always seem quite cold.~~#~1
The food was flavorful and plenty of it. Eating with only your fingers is quite fun - make your momma proud. My girlfriend won the best dish of the night - lentils and chicken and cabage/carrots. It all had kind of sweetish/bitterish/spicy flavor. I had the lamb and jalapeño dish, which was kind of greasy. You eat with your fingers and can scoop up the food with the bread they give you - a tartish type crepe, which goes well with the food. I'd be happy to go back and try something different.  If you are used to frozen pizzas and Burger King, you might want to stick with that as this experience might bit be as enjoyable as those who are more open to what they consume.~~#~1
I honestly have only positive things to say about Postino's since every one of my visits here has been very pleasant. From the valet who is running his ass off to the food and everything in between, this place does it all right! If you go here hungry, you should know that your options are basically a panini, a salad or some bruschetta. I've had a little bit of everything and for the value and quality you can't go wrong the the bruschetta. I recently determined my favorite to be the ricotta, dates and pistachio but a close second is the salami and pesto.Wine by the glass can be a bit steep so if you're planning to stay for a bit and can agree on a style with your company, you might be better off getting a bottle. A bottle is pretty much 3x the price of a glass so you end up getting 1 1/2 glasses extra. Bonus!Someday, I'll actually take advantage of their $20 deal for wine and bruschetta!~~#~1
we went back here again this past weekend...actually we went there 3 more times this past weekend alone!  we couldn't resist the awesome service and great prices...and great live music.  this is definately going to be one of our "regular joints."  if you like the country...country girls....and good old rowdy shit..then stop by and check it out for yourself.  i bet you will like this place.  there is a large dance floor for some shit kickin' ...about 3 pool tables..big buck hunter and an outdoor area for smokin and boozin and dart throwin'.  i love this place.  this is what toby keith should have been singing about...seriously!~~#~1
How does this restaurant generate so many 4 and 5 star ratings? I know it was on the food channel, but honestly the food was sub-par. Maybe it was just an off day, but I have a feeling it wasn't. The prices were not outrageous, but it wasn't cheap either. The atmosphere was nice, if very cafeteria like.But the food was way way too "greasy." And bland. And my stomach now aches after eating there....~~#~1
My boyfriend and I were in Arizona on vacation for a wedding. The food was better than the average deli and they give you a free cookie with your order too. It is a shame they don't have these in malls near me. Although I read on their website that they have one at the Galleria which would have been nice when I lived in Davis, CA for college. Shopping really works up an appetite and this satisfied it well. and light enough not to ruin a dinner as we had a wedding to attend later that evening.~~#~0
I much prefer drinking here to eating here.  Sometimes it is the only place close and I decide to order food and I always regret it.  I'm a vegetarian so maybe I'm too limited and the burgers are awesome   So stick to traditional fare.  The salads my daughter and I had yesterday were pathetic~~#~0
I found this little hot spot on Yelp and used my phone to navigate me there; I wouldn't have found it otherwise.  This small establishment is hidden in a neighborhood right off of Historic Downtown Chandler.  It's a quaint little diner with modest décor.  I felt very comfortable there and the service was fast and friendly.  As I looked over the menu the first thing I saw was the Morning Monte and havarti cheese as one of the ingredients.  Cheddar isn't better; it's all about havarti folks!  I needn't look further; I knew that's what I was having.  Hawaiian bread French toast, bacon, turkey, egg and the havarti - absolutely delicious!  Can't wait to come back and bring everyone I know.~~#~1
If I could give this 2.5 stars, I would.  But that's because I've been to Joe's Real BBQ, and so I know how good BBQ can be.Famous Dave's is fine.  There are two of them I know of, and I've been to both.  They're both fine.We visited this one, near Chandler mall, for lunch.  We ordered off the lunch menu.  My wife and I both had the brisket sandwich.  I had the Wilbur beans, she had fries.  It was fine.  Not great, but OK.The brisket meat itself did not seem to be smoked.  At all.  Meat has a certain look and taste when it has been smoked, and this just didn't have it.  Frankly, the meat seemed sorta pale...as if it had been boiled instead of grilled or smoked.  And either the meat or the sauce was excessively salty.  It wasn't severe (or I would have returned it), but it was noticeable.  Salt should enhance flavor, not stand out as a major flavor.And a note about the sauce.  I examined one of their 'for sale' bottles (you can buy their sauce to take home).  Did they use molasses or brown sugar, as most self-respecting BBQ chefs would?  No.  High fructose corn syrup.  Yuck.  Besides that stuff being poison to your pancreas, it's just "not right".  That's not how BBQ is done.Anyway, Famous Dave's is really nothing special.  The BBQ is "OK", but not very authentic.  Given the choice I would take Joe's, hands-down.  But if you want some BBQ, and are nowhere near Joe's, this will do.  Beats the heck out of Tom's BBQ, that's for sure (see my review of Tom's...truly awful).  And the beans and fries are pretty good.~~#~0
The mall of malls, for sure! So many designer boutiques, so little time! On this trip, I was given the utmost in attention from the fabulous women at the Fossil store....what fun they were! I enjoyed a smoked chicken & black bean salad @ Z Tejas next and the service was excellent. I then perused the new styles at Aqua before finding a great pair of shades at Solstice = shopper's bliss :)This review is a bit late; I visited the center on 1/27/12 - and I'll be back :)~~#~1
Qdoba is a kicked up version of Chipotle/Kokopellis.  You walk up, choose a form of delivery (burrito, nachos, salad, burrito bowl, etc) you get a choice of meat (chicken, steak, etc) then you chose your toppings (different salsas, lettuce, cheese).  We all know the drill.  I will say one thing Qdoba is much better in taste than Kokopellis and Chipotle.~~#~0
What an unbelievable night we had at Mastro's City Hall Steakhouse. Everything we ate was top notch, the atmosphere is fun, and the service is spectacular. How many steakhouses play Jim Croce, Beatles, and Beach Boys? It's a very welcome change.It's dark, it's sexy, and it's probably the best steakhouse in Arizona. The seafood tower featured totally fresh and delicious oysters, crab legs, claws, and huge shrimp. My Kansas City Strip was out of this world and probably the best piece of meat I've had all year. Gorgonzola mac & cheese and sauteed mushrooms were real winners as well. I'm not a dessert person, but the warm butter cake should be illegal it's so good. I was stuffed already when it came to the table, and then I ate all of it. The only hiccup all night was our seafood tower was short a shrimp, and when I told the waiter don't worry about it he said ok, and then proceeded to bring us a fourth shrimp on it's own bed of ice. It was a really top notch recovery. This place is absolutely amazing.~~#~1
The beer list here is GREAT. Seriously. If you like craft brews, go here.The food is meh. There are a lot of really interesting combinations, but the execution wasnt the best. The service is also meh. All 8 of us had to be wary when our waitress came around to tell her that so and so needed something too. She would take one or two orders at a time. Seriously though, the beer is awesome.~~#~0
Kabuki was great....A lovely little middle-of-the-afternoon oasis found in Tempe Marketplace!  I scoped out the menu had some some sushi for happy hour, including some rare beef sashimi, some unusual and unique rolls and complimentary edamame.  Although I did not dine here for a full meal, I feel justified in expressing my enjoyment of their happy hour.  The tiny bar was cozy and the service was good.  The happy hour prices were enticing and I would definitely return for it:)  Although for my personal taste the ambiance of Kabuki seemed a little too corporate for me I definitely would return for their happy hour and maybe to sample other menu items.  I will keep you posted on my next visit:)~~#~0
My wife and I live around the corner, hadn't eaten here in a few months. We got food for take out, Mongolian beef,kung po chicken,pad Thai noodles.  Mongolian beef, there were more white onions then scallions and it was very bland. Kung po chicken,lots of white meat chicken the whole dish only had one peanut and the taste of this dish was non existent. Very very Blah... Pad Thai noodles,the dish was dry and came out of the container in one giant clump. It tasted like plain noodles, i was glad I had peanut sauce in the fridge to,add to it. Then it was edible .... We will not be going back to G@S.. Very disappointed !!!! From now on it will be Jade palace on 92nd street. For take out Asian !!!!  Do yourself a favor go elsewhere !!!!~~#~1
I know I enjoy food when I think about how good it was later..like days and days later. It has been about a week and I am still craving the Mac n' Cheese I inhaled during my Happy Hour visit. The Macaroni was cooked to perfection, the cheese was the perfect consistency and texture, and the addition of spicy sausage really set the dish apart. While the service was impossibly slow, every waiter I came in contact with was extremely nice. But nice or not, I was sucking on melted ice for half the night while I waited to get my drinks refilled. No bueno. The atmosphere was relaxing and casual, and the bathrooms were fabulous!! Well lit, great aroma, and my choice between cloth hand towels or paper. The bathroom had well placed mirrors which made the space feel big and clean.I will definitely come back, but next time I might sneak in my own drink.~~#~0
So your going to Scottsdale via Paradise Valley....or your coming from Scottsdale heading east....your stomach is growling but you don't want the usual...then look no further than Jason's Deli. I was in that situation on Friday night and decided to give this locale a try....and I must say I was not disappointed. I had the Smokey Jack Panini with Smoked turkey breast....guacamole....provolone cheese....lettuce...tomato....bacon on the side which I gave to my wife....LOL...since I don't eat red meat....and Russian dressing. However sandwich was made to order and pressed perfectly on the grill....and the flavor was outstanding. They give you a pickle and homemade potato chips on the side....and I also had some lemonade which comes from a fountain with free refills. I almost missed out on the free Ice Cream....but I seen people walking around with cones of Ice Cream and I had my wife ask was it free. Indeed it was and we both enjoyed a nice Ice Cream cone....mine was chocolate vanilla swirl...and you can also get it in a cup as well. The service was great and the whole place had a real nice neighborhood feel to it.....I look forward to returning here very soon. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!~~#~1
I like the review of the whacked waiter... i think he may be still at work at 'Cantina Laredo' cuz i think he served us....... Called ahead after a Cardinals game to make sure there was room enough for our party of 10- " No problem " we were told , come on down. arrived 9:00 ish on a beautiful 80F evening in Scottsdale -stepped across a half empty patio into the spacious Cantina - chilled to an ungodly 60F- Note to the great state of Arizona : (the reason that y'all are booming and experiencing sustained in-migration is because people are like lizards--- ( in more ways than one)---they like the sun , they like the heat ... they flee from northern climes to get away from the chill - Don't AC your premises such that it reminds us of Duluth in winter.... we just escaped Duluth in winter and fled south to thaw ) .we asked for a spot on the patio and our man immediately declined stating that " he had already set a table for us inside"- upon my wife's insistence that he reevaluatethe patio  he disappeared for a moment or two and then reappeared - affirming that the half empty patio was indeed full. this puzzled my wife who then surmised that : A) he wanted our large party in his section -not the patioB) there would likely be a built in minimum gratuity on the final bill                                       ( there was)                  after taking our drink order ,(competently),  he returned with salsa and chips. The salsa he described as being of two types "hot " or "regular"-there were indeed two temperatures -but they appeared  to be seperated thermally rather than chemically -??  the same salsa one served at room temperature , one served chilled...???when asked about the best dishes for people who wanted a little kick to their food he replied: " I wouldn't really know , I don't like spicy food" ????????????????? Dude , can you not at least fake something.... it is after all a Mexican restaurant. If people want spice they go Mexican - if they want bland they seek out a Saskatchewan restaurant - non? The meal was salvaged - ( not saved), by a compatriot of our man who hailed from Durango- he spoke knowledgeably about the menu , filled our empty margarita glasses and retreated into the kitchen to assemble , on our behalf , a pepper mole sauce that was truely outstanding.The food was uninspired -( there was a Baja Grill of some sort across the parking lot and we wondered if they shared a kitchen...) , the service was poor ( excepting our hombre from Mejico ), and the casa freakishly cold--Two stars tops over all but boosted up to three by our amigo from Victoria de Durango~~#~0
Whew!  What a hike.  Coming from Colorado, though, the relative comparison makes it just a 3.  Firstly, it's definitely treacherous.  When we arrived between 730 and 8 on a Saturday morning, there were about four, maybe five firetrucks in the parking area...these rescue/aid teams just camp out there, I think, because of all the doofuses who don't plan accordingly waterwise or overestimate their ability to make this climb.  Also, two different areas of the Echo Canyon trail are especially steep and potentially slick, so they've installed some metal railings to help you along there...but only if you've got some gloves or if the temperature is moderate (uhhhh,...that doesn't really happen in Phoenix during the day in summer), because those damn things get hot enough to fry an egg.  Also - water, water, water.  Bring a LOT, or top off at the start of the trail before you go up (though the water out of that tap attached to the water fountain is about 85 degrees, yuk). It was a fun jaunt.  The view was worth it - not entirely picturesque as far as nature goes, but it was nice view of the city and surrounding area.  If you go, just be wary of the sun/heat, and know that you'll be clambering over and around boulders and such.  (If you trip, it's CURTAINS!)~~#~0
My boyfriend and I tried this place out last Saturday. Our total was $24 for 2 burgers, 2 fries, 2 beverages. Not bad for a lunch in Scottsdale. We found the burgers to be just OK tasting. Nothin special to lure us back anytime soon. I was satisfied with portions for $. I think people are used to ridiculous huge meals like the ones served at cheesecake factory which are big enough to feed a family of horses so when they see a normal single portion they feel underwhelmed/cheated. I found the restaurant to be clean and nice enough to sit & enjoy the burger & kill some time before our movie started.~~#~0
After a year in the Valley, one of my girlfriends took me to Side Bar.  I really like the atmosphere.  It was sleek yet cozy. The night we went in, it was hopping but not overly crowded.  A welcome sight considering much of my first year in the Valley was spent in crowded, pretentious Scottsdale hotspots. As I get older, I crave more intimate setting and SideBar fits the bill.  Also, I give five stars to any business who goes out of their way to help a good cause.  SideBar is just that kind of establishment.  If anyone is on Twitter, follow #buzzcation.  @SideBarphx has let #buzzcation folks hold a number of networking and fundraising happy hours.  It's a cool crew so come out and joing and I commend SideBar for always accomodating this crazy crew of tweeples. :)~~#~1
I've been a bunch of times for takeout and took a seriously picky foodie friend this past weekend.  Everything I've had here has been excellent and I mean, excellent.  In the past I've had the margherita pizza, eggplant parm and fried calamari.  All good.  This weekend we had the comp tapenade, beef carpacchio, lasagna and one of the pizzas (can't remember name -- had olives, art hearts, ham and ?).  All delicious.  The lasagna was so delicate but melded perfectly with the sauce.My very particular picky friend LOVED the place.  Seriously loved it.~~#~1
As good as it gets.  We ate here for a birthday celebration and we were taken away by the great food and service (as usual).  We requested the V Lounge and were given a nice corner booth.  When we sat down there was a birthday card signed by the employees of the restaurant -- a very nice touch.  For appetizers, we had oysters and the (best) crab cakes (anywhere).  Steaks and seafood as our main courses paired well with the red cabernet wine.  Overall, just incredible.  Completely up to par with Eddie V's standards -- comparing to Houston and Austin.  My mom forgot her sweater at the booth and a hostess ran out to give it to her.  We also got a follow-up phone call the next day asking how everything went.  For those special occasions or a fun happy hour, Eddie V's never lets you down!  Also, their Banana's Foster is divine!  Save room for it or just stuff your face and go to the gym the next day -- delish!~~#~1
There really isn't much I like about Michael's to begin with - I especially dislike them for using my name and putting on such an inferior showing - but this location was a particular disaster.  Clean up your aisles for goodness sake, I feel claustrophobic with all the crap hanging around - its like the clothing section at K-Mart, but possibly worse.~~#~1
Heart be still I loved this place. Way better than I expected. I had the spicy noodles and they were delicious, flavor great and quality was on point. For desert the sticky rice with mango, I dream about it now. Highly recommend if you are in the mood for Thai food. I'll be back!~~#~1
Still 5 stars, but sadly Amber is closing up shop.  Don't feel bad for her as it is not for the lack of business.  She is getting married and leaving the state and taking Spoken with her.  Damn her!!!  I did pick up some jeans and 3 shirts, all at 60% off.  So hurry over and pick up some bargains!  And wish Amber good luck!~~#~1
This is my favorite spa in the world! Hopefully, I'll make it to others...but if I could only get to the Camelback Inn, I'd be in heaven. Here's the rundown of how I enjoy the place: Early morning appointment for massage - Rose does fantastic hot stone - I like her the best. Then I shower and get into the eucalyptus steam room. Next I head out to the pool and savor the view of Camelback Mountain and the amazing desert landscaping they've procured. I drink some water and as I lounge there, I order a small, healthy and very tasty meal (usually breakfast). I swim a little, lounge a lot - regardless of the time of year.  If I have planned it, I then head back into the showers and clean up for my next treatment. I spend hours there and if I feel like I might be pressed for time, I reschedule.~~#~1
Bad service, great food, awful coffee.~~#~0
I had been craving sushi steadily for about two weeks, so I decided to try somewhere new. This place happens to be just across the street from my work and the reviews on here were a vote of confidence. I had the cherry blossom roll and rainbow roll, shared edamame, and hot green tea. The cherry blossom roll was good, not amazing, but good. The fish was fresh enough, and I did like the eel sauce drizzled on it. The rainbow roll was much less rainbow than I'm used to. The rainbow roll did have a bit of a fishy taste, and the whitefish on it was a pale yellowish brown color, and not as moist as it could have been. The crumbled macadamia nuts were and interesting and kind of fun garnish. The edamame was tasty, not over cooked, but could have used a little more salt. The green tea was boiling hot, with the kind of walnutty aftertaste you get from good green tea, I was disappointed it came in a single glass, not in a tea pot diffuser with a teacup like at most restaurants.My girlfriend had pork katsu, the sauce drizzled on it was sweet and vinegary, but not too overwhelming. Gauging from the fact that she ate all of it I would assume it was pretty good. The salad that came with it was a bit strange, iceberg lettuce and a cream sesame dressing. The miso soup on the side was better than the little packets I get at the store, but didn't taste home made. It was not too salty, but the tofu must have been dehydrated, it was in tiny little shriveled squares on the bottom of the bowl. The waitstaff was very attentive and friendly. It wasn't too busy when we went, about 5pm. The music was typical pop music, but thankfully unlike some places (RA for instance) its not blaring. I would say its definately not the best sushi I've ever had, not even the best I've had in arizona, but it was ok. The rainbow rolls at kobe are better.~~#~0
Meh.Plus for cool decor. Minus for being in a strip mall (but hey it's Phoenix...)Cinnamon Roll was good.  Awesome icing. Toluca Brizza was unique, but nothing spectacular.it would be a good place for groups, with a vast menu (that i hear is very vegan friendly), but they are better places around town for brunch, both in terms of quality and price points.~~#~0
3 syllables for this place. A-MAZ-ING!The best Phoenix has to offer.~~#~1
I've been coming here since the 70's when it was across the street and had a screen door. I know the staff and the daily specials by heart.  When I lived away from PHX it was the place I wished for. When I go to NYC I have to take RM food to my friends. The whole family agrees. I don't understand the negative reviews. The reviewers must have had a bad day. I love the food and so has everyone  I know.~~#~1
It's not hard to find a steakhouse in Scottsdale.  Modern Steak's schtick is that it is... well, "modern" in the sense that it's not in a dark oak-filled room with overstuffed booths.  Unfortunately, however, "modern" also means that it's in a mall.  Ugh.Pretty efficient (if not brusque) service, with decent enough food.  I had the salmon w/ maple and bacon glaze.  It's a bit of a bizarre combo -- I'm not sure the salmon quite holds up under such a sweet glaze, but you can't complain too much anytime bacon is involved :)~~#~0
The food and service were both amazing. I've had the gyro pita, orzo and greek potatoes. All were fantastic. Try the gelato also. It's the best in town! The owners are very friendly and happy to speak with each customer.~~#~1
Rita's Kitchen is a hidden gem located right smack in the center of the Camelback Inn. While this may be a hot-spot for hotel guests, I think that locals might be missing out on its charm. I am a huge fan of anything the Camelback Inn does, especially since they offer live music and a great space for relaxation and Rita's Kitchen is no exception. This restaurant is airy and opens up to the spacious Camelback Inn patio where they play live music every night. Breakfast: Breakfast at Rita's is sublime and pretty reasonably priced. They offer a breakfast buffet for around $23 which includes eggs made to order (including omelets), pancakes, waffles, pastries, fresh fruit, bacon, sausage and hashbrowns. It's a great pick for a leisurely weekend breakfast. Just today was Mother's Day and while we only did the breakfast buffet, I did catch a glimpse of the Mother's Day brunch and holy moly do they know how to wow a crowd! Not only did they have stations set up all throughout the restaurant, patio and R-Bar, but they also had an extensive dessert area with build-your-own sundaes, freshly made cotton candy (in an old fashioned cotton candy maker) and a long dessert table with a chocolate fountain. Lunch:Lunch here is sublime and I also enjoy either the tacos or the chicken sandwich. The chicken sandwich is particularly a favorite of mine due to the cheese and sauce. The fries are tasty as well and you can either get sweet potato or regular. I also get sweet potato then regret not just getting the regular which are better in my mind. If the weather permits, sit on the patio and enjoy the beautiful water fountains, views of the mountain and tropical/desert setting.~~#~1
We happened upon this location when meeting a friend for dinner.  When I showed up there was a line of about 20 people ahead of me.  i asked them to put me in first available and they said 15-20min and then 45min for a booth.Ok, I'll wait.Our friends showed up and my girlfriend had asked if there was a spot at the bar we could sit in the mean time.  We were there for about 10min already.  That's when she said to us. "Your table inside is ready"  she walked us right there and we were sat.  WOW!  that was quick!We ordered drinks and food.  I got these jerk chicken wings for an appetizer and holy cow, they were delicious.  For my main dish I ordered a garlic noodle dish.  It definitely hit the spot.  My only beef would be that it was hard to talk with so many people inside.  I wont let that affect the rating though.Awesome place!~~#~1
We stayed at the Hyatt Gainey Ranch during spring break and had a fabulous time. We ate at SWB for lunch and enjoyed it so much we ordered dinner that evening to eat in the room with our kids. My husband ordered me the chocolate caramel tart which turned out to be one of the best desserts I've ever had. I tried looking for the recipe and couldn't find it so I figured it wouldn't hurt to ask for it. Surprisingly I received an almost immediate response from the hotel that they would let the chef know. Within a few hours the recipe from the chef was in my e-mail with additional tips! Now I call that customer service. We loved the hotel and loved the restaurant. Looking forward to going back someday.~~#~1
Called these guys when an evap cooler water pressure line at my office burst.  A guy with a clean white shirt tucked in to his pants introduced himself to me, assessed my problem, and quoted a very fair price to fix it. This guy was way too clean, personable and professional to be the plumber? He went right to work and had everything back to normal for me in no time! You have to understand... I am use to a dirty, loud, intrusive  plumber that smiles with his butt!  These guys won me over and their telephone number 623-977-4458 is in my cell phone now.  I highly recommend Palmer's Plumbing!!!~~#~1
I got a coupon at a past Yelp event to try them out and I'm SO glad I did!  Massage Envy really exceeded my wildest expectations for a chain that offers affordable rates for massage therapy.  I was pleasantly surprised by the level of expertise and professionalism that I experienced!My massage therapist was Dannie and she worked through my trigger points and loosened my tight muscles with an intuition that I have rarely experienced.I highly recommend this place and hope to return soon!~~#~1
Ask for Alex - he is very helpful and knowledgeable with products in the store. He is a young college student and works part time but always has a great attitude and finds the best deals for our family. Thanks Alex!~~#~1
It's the place to be. I went before heading over to Symphony Hall and seeing Ballet AZ perform Giselle. Having heard great reviews about the place, it's food and the vibe... I had to try it.Restored into a restaurant and bar from an old department store, Hanny's has the feel straight of of New York City. The lighting is dim enough to give that sexy, intimate feelings and with long, pew style seating with individual tables, the vibe is very posh.My roommate and I ordered the bruscetta plate and the margarita pizza. Very good choice! The bruscetta plate was on the saltier side, so be wary of that but it was delish. The pizza was much bigger than we expected. For $10 you really do get a good deal. We each orded drinks. A orded the peach martini and a glass of giseling. Wasn't a HUGE fan of the martini and I thought it tasted like cough syrup but it was also my very first martini so I am not holding Hannys against anything. My roommate on the other hand said it was the best Manhattan he'd ever had, which I believe.Hannys has a modern feel with a touch of Mad Men and I simply cannot wait to go back.~~#~1
While Scottsdale's Jackrabbit Supper Club is Britney Spears-approved -- the pop singer made the rounds last December when she reportedly made out with Arizona Cardinals hottie Matt Leinart -- it's a little too clubby for my taste. The music is usually loud, making it hard to carry on a conversation and nearly everyone looks like they stepped out of the pages of a fashion magazine. Oh, and be prepared to throw down more than the norm for drinks -- martinis are $13! If all of this isn't scaring you away, you'll probably have a good time. And the best part? The bar offers hourly burlesque-style performances from the club's saucy dancers.~~#~0
Definitely one of my favorite places to eat, hands down.  I love their enchiladas verdes combo.  Their refried beans are THE BEST!  I have been eating here for over 15 years and the waitresses are mostly the same.  Definitely feels like you are at an old friends house when you are there.  Yes, it is in a bad area, but that hasn't ever deterred me from telling everyone I know that if they want really good, real Mexican food at a great price, to head down there.  And their green salsa for dipping chips is amazing.~~#~1
This is a great QT for when you're driving through Phoenix on I-17. It's right off the freeway so it's perfect for stopping for gas and grabbing a tasty snack.Plus it's a QuikTrip, there isn't really any part of it that isn't awesome.~~#~1
flemings is always top notch. we went for the thursday night wine tasting 20 wines for $25 introducing there new 100 wines by the glass. The selection was good from lite whites to deep reds a great way to sample a portion of there new wine list. then to top it off we received $25 gift cards for dinner. so we stayed and had the AZ resturant week pre fix dinner for $39 the food was wonderful. salads, soup lamb chops and filet. i guess to sum it up you can't go wrong with a meal from flemings. they also have a great happy hour.~~#~1
oK, first i broke my promise to myself and went here again, i figured by now things have got to be better. i ordered something that i wouldn't care if it was cold, French Toast. ok so the french toast is good. but it wasn't worth waiting 40 fucking minutes to get it. and on top of it. my friends food was cold again. one of them would rather eat glass then eat at this place so refused to order a cold meal, but since my other friend was paying she said fuck it i'll go.well she ordered toast and some sausage as sides. and my other friend ordered the mish mash, his review of the place is more generious then mine, but he's only been there once and said it wasn't so bad. lol.so anyways toast, soo cold the butter couldn't even melt. and cold sausage to boot. the friend with the mishmash, lol. i saw the bottom of the bowl and it was all a weird watery substance at the bottom. how hard is it to drain poached eggs before dumping them in a bowl?i was going to give palatte 3 stars based on the french toast, but it was hardly warm. i so badly want to like this place cause it's close and Matt's is always packed.can i please get a breakfast place in the roosevelt area that is large enough to seat more then 20 people and serves good breakfast?~~#~1
I really like this place and I must say it's the best pizza I have had West of Chicago.  The sauce is on the sweet side, but I like that.  It's kid friendly so it's a great casual place to be with family and friends without a pretentious side to it.The lines can be a little long at times but I think it's worth the wait.~~#~1
Good destination for pizza. Would frequently go there for a slice at lunch when I worked in the area. Nice New York style pizza with a crisp crust.~~#~0
Green is by far one of my favorite restaurants to eat at.  My husband loves it too and he is a carnivore!  Our favorite things to get are the "boneless buffalo wings" and something that another customer shared with me while waiting in line that is not on the menu "the Wendy's pickle sandwich" It is amazing!  Another special they have from time to time is "the big WAC" and I must say it is better than the real thing!!!!!~~#~1
This is a must try for any Mani Pedi fan. I use to drive to Scottsdale for all of my services until I found this spot. Get the pedi, no metal file pedi once - and you will NEVER go any where else. Have fun. I do..Customer service - top end. Thanks~~#~1
They have some rude employees its unbelievable. I'm trying to give business to them and ordered 6 smoothies and the cashier and her employee gave me a dirty look. Not customer friendly. At all.~~#~1
I had the best culinary experience of my 8 years in Phoenix tonight. First time at Switch. Started off with some appetizers; pesto & sun dried tomato risotto, marinated chicken breast, Mac n cheese. All delicious!  Next my wife orders the blackened salmon. I looked at her with my wtf scowl. We don't even eat seafood. "It looks interesting" she says. Whatever. It gets to the table and it's the biggest hunk of salmon I've seen. We simultaneously stab into it with our forks, take a bite, and we look at each other like the first time we fell in love. The combination of the salmon, bacon and sautéed greens was out of this world. Coupled with the bread pudding and sweet tomato concoction put me over the top. We let the waitress know what we experienced and to thank the chef. She brought him out and he spoke with us for about 15 minutes. Jason is touched by the hand of God. He proceeded to tell us what he had planned for tomorrow's dinner menu and we made reservations on the spot for tomorrow night. I never knew food could profoundly affect your mood but I was driving home singing my heart out to my iPod. Got home, plugged the iPod into the stereo and continued the concert, danced with my dog and made me a latte.  Perfect night.  Thank you Jason and Switch.~~#~1
New to the Scottsdale area, I've been searching for a nail salon for a few weeks. I stumbled upon this place and was very happy. Although it's in a weird strip mall, it's really relaxing inside. My gel manicure was perfect, and the shoulder massage was a nice added extra! Totally recommend!~~#~1
The pizza is incredible, they use really high quality ingredients and the prices are great. I would recommend cooking it on the bottom rack of your oven for a slightly better texture on the crust.I want someone to mark that this post is funny, so I will add a joke:Mushroom walks into a bar... Bartender says, "sorry, we don't serve your type here." Mushroom says "why not? I'm a fungi (fun guy)."~~#~1
I really don't get why everyone is raving this place.  I've been here twice and ordered the carne asada burrito.  The portions are really small for the price that they charge.  There is too much tortilla for the meat.  I think this place is overrated and that there are better places for carne asada in the valley.~~#~1
RIP AZ Coffee Connection.  :(  I stopped by two days ago unaware that they had closed.  I am severely bummed.  This place is irreplaceable!  Damn you, Starbucks and McDonalds!~~#~1
Probably one of the better gay bars in town.. friendly.. decent crowd.. reasonable prices.. after hopping from one to another this place was our favorite. Lots of furry muscle bears too! Nice!!~~#~0
I have had it with the meat department at Whole Foods Market on Scottsdale Rd & the Mayo Blvd. They really suck.I gave them another chance (out of desperation really) and they blew it!  I am so disappointed.  I purchased some turkey breasts there (3 of them) at around $30.00 for a 4 lb breast. I came home, froze two and cooked one. It smelled, but my husband insisted that it was the smoked smell of being in the butcher case with all the other meats.I trusted his opinion and cooked it. Upon slicing it up for dinner, I found that the free range turkey was very fatty. It was gross but no one got sick luckily.Well, now I just thawed out another one and the same thing but worse. It stinks like the rotting dead animal it is. It is definitely bad.And it gets even worse! As I inspected it and opened up the two breasts (Whole Foods puts two breast together with a net to make one large one), I pulled out about 8 inches of thick, fatty, I don't even know what from it. Let's just say it definitely LOOKS like the dead animal it is too. What ever that stuff is, it is all gray and rotten.They are basically stuffing their Turkey Breasts with junk to make more money. I have had it with them! I am not surprised. They have always been trouble. Frank the manager there is really not the kind of guy one would trust with food. His is kind of creepy and gives off a dirty "I don't care" attitude.I spent over $100.00 there on Turkey (ground & whole) and he (Frank) still charged me for the breast bones - and another employee told me that they usually just throw them in the trash!The meats at this butcher department cannot be trusted. The manager there cannot be trusted and has failed every time. It is really gross; top dollar for top trash! My husband thinks the manager is getting some sort of incentive for selling the "questionable meat" instead of throwing it out!  I am still nauseous from the smell, sight and from touching all that gray, rotting gross stuff. BLEECH!!! I think I ate that in the last one!~~#~1
just say no.this place is truly awful. too bad it's taking up valuable space on monroe.~~#~1
I am ready to update you to a five because the last three times I have been there, your service has been better, the huevos rancheros has been consistently perfect, I have never had to wait for a seat at the bar and I want to hug the cute new bartender because she is quirkily cute!! If you were still serving breakfast at 6pm, I would come eat you now.~~#~1
Always wanted to stop by, and give them a try. Only thing that stopped me were some bad rumors of how clean they are? But then again, how clean is all the places we eat at?? So I had their 8" Meat Ball sandwich, this was my second choice? I wanted was their cheese steak! But they were out of cheeses steak. But I do not regret their meat ball sandwich. It was very good, wish their bread would have been more toasted. But I thought it was good anyways. Place looks like and feels like a lot like Subway. But I do agree, they do add more meat to the sandwich. I will probably come back again.~~#~0
Sacks is a great little place.  One issue and I know this wouldn't seem like a bad thing (at least if you are the owner) but it is a bit too busy for me.  I can never find a parking place or a seat.  The sandwiches are good and I like them, but I will admit that sometimes I don't go just because of the crowds.  The food is good.  I like that they have a variety of sandwhiches and they put a lot of things on the sandwiches which can easily be taken off for the picky folks like me unlike other places where things are mixed in and not removable.  If you are looking for a good tastey sandwhich, this is a great place to check out.  If you are looking for a nice relaxing lunch where you can find a seat, move along.~~#~0
I have passed this place for 20 years and had always heard good things. Well one night when we were kidless we went. It was pricier that we thought but we forgot the price once the meals arrived. We were both very impressed. Warm homemade bread. Awesome salads. I tried the escolar (it's a fish that a friend of mine loved but I had never tried it) and it absolutely melted in my mouth. My husband enjoyed his sausage and peppers. We will definitely go back!~~#~1
Once again Wildflower proves why it's my favorite breakfast hangout! Jeff the Manager on staff today rocks! Some of us hangout at a restaurant to make it a working meal...and sometimes, during that time Nature calls...so I asked the busboy to not clear my table as I needed to step away for a moment and he cheerfully agreed. I came back to find my table cleared by new patrons who had taken it upon themselves to steal my table (I guess the fact that the food was only half eaten, and the water and coffee were still half filled were no clue). The busboy was upset that he'd turned his back for just a moment and Jeff came to the rescue...after apologizing to me and finding the perfect way to make it right, he vowed to let the new people know that they were rather um 'overly proactive' in clearing the table themselves and that he had some people who regularly relaxed and worked in the restaurant and do step away.He handled the situation with me just right and I am sure that those people that took my table were made to gently understand that they need to ask before taking an uncleared table.Kudos to Jeff and the staff for making me so happy I had to tell everyone here...and to the couple who took my table, if you are reading this...did you REALLY need that booth? I mean, when I came out of the can there were like, I dunno, 5 empty tables...seriously? Like, did you propose there or something????~~#~1
Came here for lunch recently with active Yelper and friend Brett B. I'm sure he'll post up his own review of the place.This is the kind of place you walk up to the register and place your order, then take a plastic number to your table and the server brings you your food. You also get your glass and go fill 'er up at the fountain yourself. I wasn't sure what to expect, but felt good vibes the minute I asked "how big is the salad" and the guy at the register walked into the kitchen to bring me a dish to show me. That was nice and above my expectation, as most places the servers will make a "size" with their hands and shrug and say, "i don't know... about like this?" So, yeah. I like that this guy actually showed me a plate and made a "mound" with his hand to show me some kind of size of the salad. When I ordered "just water" he went to give me a plastic cup with a lid, and then said, "you know what? Just take a regular glass, it's more comfortable...." He trusted me not to fill up my glass with anything but water (and I did only drink water). That was nice, and made me feel like an adult. Not like at some places (much cheaper than this place) that give you a plastic cup like the ones you pee in at the doctor's office, when you order water.I really enjoyed my lunch here - Had a chicken caesar salad (one of my favorite things to order pretty much anywhere i go because I'll never make it at home), along with a cheese pizza.The caesar salad - for those who have a love affair with this meal - was "perfect" . The portion was generous, and it was chopped and tossed. The chicken was shredded and mixed in with the salad, which makes SUCH a difference in getting an even distribution, and reducing pain-in-the-ass-ness of having to cut up a chicken breast atop a salad with oversized utensils like at so many other places. It was perfectly dressed too - not too heavy, just right. And the parmesan cheese was shaved over it, rather than shredded or grated. Nice touch. Excellent flavor, every mouthful.The cheese pizza was a cripsy, ultra thin crust, delicious red sauce (kinda sweet, in a good way), and the cheeses were mozzarella and fontina - the saltiness mixed really well with the sweetness of the sauce and made this simple pizza taste extraordinary.Granted, having had some beyond-extraordinary pizza in new york, I'm spoiled and have to say it was not as good as my favorite thin crust pizza from Totonno's in NYC's upper east side. But still, darn good. I'd eat it again. (I took some home and it didn't look like it heated up well later on when my husband was having it).Brett had the tomato, gorgonzola, chicken, salad on mixed greens. I think it had pine nuts too. I got to taste it and it was even more flavorful than mine. Either one of these would be an excellent choice for those of you who like to order salads. Delicious. And the service was great! The  manager even came by our tables to refill our glasses for us, though the drinks were self-serve from a fountain. the place was not busy when we got there, but it picked up as we were finishing our meals. Great food - great service - great vibe. I hope this place sticks around. Definitely would eat there again. Looking forward to it, even!~~#~0
There are no words to express the value of the quality of service that you receive from  Tina Yragui's Hands 4 Healing  therapeutic overall body care.  The value  of knowledge of the body, the commitment of service, the excellence of research for each individual client. The degree that she possesses cannot be measured with a dollar amount because no dollar amount can beat this value. It is value what goes far beyond what you receive each and every time you see Tina.  Tina is a healer and is dedicated to you. It just doesn't get any better!Carol Taylor-TassoneErica Elizabeth Tassone~~#~1
Food middle of the road... The staff is rude.. Seems like it starts with the owner. I think she makes the staff pay for everything that goes wrong so in turn they dont want to fix issues with poor, wrong food etc.  I think she tends to forget the customers are actually what keeps a business open. For a long time it was the only choice in the area. Now there are multiple choices.  If your in the area Chili's or Connolys is much better choice in my oppinion.~~#~1
If there was a way I could give this restaurant NO stars, I might have.  The chips and salsa are the ONLY thing that requires a star here.The service was less than average, the food was hotter than the surface of the sun, and the drinks were teeny tiny (and didn't much taste like alcohol).  My husband ordered a green chile dish and it came smothered in red sauce, when he asked the waiter if it looked green or red, the server said, "nope that's what green looks like".  WOW!Sorry but I don't think I will be returning.~~#~1
I have been here many times, pretty much can't go wrong here. prices are good service is prompt and friendly.~~#~1
As an artist, I've come to be very picky about the stores from which I purchase my art supplies. Arizona Art Supply is a GREAT store!!! Every time I visit I overhear the staff's experienced recommendations; they take the time to ensure that every customer's needs are satisfied. I am always immediately welcomed as I delve into the fully stocked and well-organized aisles. Yes, this is my kind of art supply store!  As I browse the expansive selection of everything from  drawing supplies to paint, easels and canvases to ceramic tools, an overwheming desire to create comes over me. AZ Art Supply has a HUGE selection of my favorite brands--Prismacolor and Golden Paints!  Although this store is smaller, the prices are reasonable--they beat out Michael's prices for nearly every item. If you're looking for exceptional quality, a diverse selection and a knowledgeable staff, Arizona Art Supply is your best bet.~~#~1
We had a large group and they honored our reservation with having the tables ready at our specified time as opposed to getting them ready when we arrived. We had a somewhat set menu. The tofu dumplings were delicious. Satay chicken was alright. We had a choice between 3 entrees. I want to give them higher ratings for their service, but the spiciness between the dishes were very inconsistent. You get to choose on a 1-5 scale and finding a dish that suited your desired spiciness was a hit or miss. Some people's 1-2 were super spicy and other's 4-5 weren't that spicy. (note: 5 is spiciest) Also, we had a huge mess with the bill where they put all the appetizers onto one bill for a table, and none on ours. It was quite a mess trying to figure that out. Also, their timing for food was so bizarre. By the time 1 table had basically finished their dinner then the rest of the meals arrived.  Then again, dealing with 40+ people is a lot.~~#~0
We were visiting again, so of course that means at least 2 trips to Sugar Bowl!  The food, service and ice cream were good as always, but WOW, the prices sure have gone up.  I know that the economy sucks, but for what we got, the prices just don't seem to justify it.  We had different waitresses both times.  The fist was efficient but not very warm.  We had Sandra on our second visit - and YES, she remembered us again!  Could not believe it.  She is very friendly and can really keep up when they get swamped.  We will be back, but maybe only once per visit instead of 2 (or 3 or 4) times.  Just can't afford those prices for what you get.~~#~0
So yummy in my tummy. My sister and I went here for dinner and the food was as always-- very yummy. We had the marinated BBQ pork and the seafood hot pot at hot. We finished half the of the plates because they give you a lot. It would be better of the price wasn't as pricey. But overall, awesome service and yummy food! We will be back!!They first serve you lil condiment plates from seaweed to kimchi (spicy marinated cabbage that has been fermentated). When they serve you your food, they will ask if you want egg in the soup-- of course!!! They crack it in front of you in the sizzling hot soup...drools. Serving you some extra rice for the soup and pork. We had to pack to go boxes because it was a lot of food. Today, we went again for Father's Day and our family agreed this was so yummy. We had the BBQ pork again with Dumpling Tofu soup ("Yum-O" Rachael Ray) and Bibimbap with rice! The Bibimbap was okay but everything was excellent. Our family of five finished nearly everything. :D so GOOOOOD! Going to come back soon! Check this place out!~~#~1
LOVE the food!!!!~~#~1
I am a huge Suns fan but my review is about the fundraising options that the Suns have to offer as well as their back-office staff.First and foremost, talk about a professional, classy organization. Whether you have fundraising experience or are a total novice, the staff treats you like you are the only group they are working with. My contact is Kyle Pottinger and he is always a gentleman. No matter what questions I have, he always answers them promptly and never makes me feel like I'm bothering him. The fundraising process is easy and the tickets practically sell themselves because who doesn't want the chance to purchase discounted tickets? The process is easy and the rewards can be lucrative depending on the target audience you are working with. The Suns will treat you professionally and courteously. You won't be disappointed.~~#~1
They have high definition pictures of their menu items proudly displayed on the walls, and I like that.Regarding the Chicken Pad Thai. The chicken and tofu were cooked perfectly, but the noodles were a bit chewy.Spring rolls were great. The pic on the menu shows them served in halves, but they arrived at our table whole.My date had their Thai noodle bowl, and Id suggest skipping on the beef balls.  Also, its very bland if you order with no spice.The owner recommended that we vacation in Thailand.  He also offered to install new granite flooring in out home.  Travel agent, mason, restaurateur.  He does it all.~~#~0
These guys helped me out with my rear windshield wiper.  They could have just shrugged their shoulders and said they didn't have the part, but they worked with me and tried a couple of different options until we found a solution.  Everyone I encountered was great.~~#~1
Eating in is a decent experience, but for delivery, I have yet to meet their match.  When I order delivery I always get a 16" chicken pizza with alfredo sauce on top, and for the last 6 years I have received it in 30 minutes or less all but 2 times.  Its always tasty, fresh, and is my preeminent food for delivery, ever, period.~~#~1
I love boba drinks but hate the word "boba". I always feel like an ape when I say that word.  Anyways.There was a period where I use to drink this stuff at least 3 times a week when I was living in San Francisco, so when I say I love something, I really do (or is it more like a creepy obsession?) So! When I found a boba place here I got excited, especially when I saw that they had green milk tea.I can't vouch for all of their drinks, as I've only tried the green milk tea and avocado snow, but every time I have ordered them they have been super good.~~#~1
A girlfriend and I have been meaning to check Bombay Spice out for a while but have never gotten around to it until last night. (I found a great deal on LocalDines.com -use ref # 102729 if you sign up! Also, checking in with FourSquare got a us a deal! ) We ended up going a little later (8ish) so there wasnt a wait or a crowd at all which was nice because the venue is a little smaller. The bartender was very friendly, our serve was a little distracted and took a little longer to respond to our needs but she was very nice.We both had wine, the "single glass" serving is actually 2 glasses in case you are torn between splitting a bottle for $20 or just buying a glass for $6.  I recommend the Falling Star Cab, it was full bodied and very yummy. The other wine we tried was the Hob Nob Pinot Noir. It was great, it had a delicious combination of earthy and sweet tones to it. (I am not very good with wine lingo, but those are my unofficial terms that make sense to me.)Neither of us were very hungry but we wanted to sample the fare so we could at least see if we wanted to come back. We got to choose either a free humus or a dessert because of my deal for checking in on FourSquare (POWER NERD! I know.) I really wanted to try the mango sorbet but we opted for the chickpea hummus and roti bread. For those of you, like me, who aren't sure what roti bread is- its much lighter than pita bread and a little thinner than a tortilla. Its very tasty. The hummus was very good, and they garnished it with diced tomatoes, onions and cilantro which i loved!We also ordered the seared eggplant. It was AWESOME. It was a large slab of eggplant with a black sauce that was herby (thats a technical term in case you were wondering). They also served the egglplant with a yellow sauce drizzled on the plate which was sweet and very good, in addition to a small scoop of a red chili sauce (our waitress told me the name and I couldnt remember it for the life of me) which was spicy...I really loved this sauce it was the perfect amount of spice for the eggplant. I will be going back here to try the curry and some of the other things on the menu i cant pronounce. There are a LOT of vegetarian/vegan dishes clearly marked on the menu. Their menu also boasts that everything, except for 9 or 10 items, is completely Gluten free.Good experience, definitely looking forward to trying it again for a full meal.~~#~0
I found Cake Frenzy through an service listing on Craigslist while looking for someone to create our wedding cake/cupcakes. Not only were we on a tight budget we only had about 2 1/2 months to plan for the venue we wanted only had a few dates available. I met Jennifer about a month prior, my fiance' and I knew we wanted a peanut butter & jelly cake and she happily obliged. I emailed her a picture of what I wanted and the day of our wedding when I first saw our cake I almost cried. She went above and beyond my expectations. The cake was beautiful with sugar flowers and gelatin butterflies. All of our guests loved the flavor combinations and the decorations. I highly recommend Cake Frenzy, she is professional, she takes pride in her work and extremely reasonable.~~#~1
Love it.Last night I dropped into Romanelli's for the first time after driving past a time or two.  Glad I did.It's a bakery and deli that offers a fine selections of meats, cheeses and breads.  They also sell all things culinary Italia.  When I stopped in it was 30-40 minutes to close.  I went directly to the deli counter for a sub and was met with a challenge as I decided which to try.  I opted for George's Special (ham, capicolla, salami, mortadella, pepperoni, provolone and hot peppers).  Given the close proximity to closing time I was expecting a sub on older bread that had been sitting around all day but it was still soft and very fresh.  The sub is easily the best I've had.  Amazing.I also purchased a cannoli.  I'm picky about these things.  Too many places fill 'em and stock 'em and the filling makes the shell soggy.  Romanelli's fills them upon order just like the Italian bakery near a friends house in Newark, NJ (until last night the best cannoli I've had).  The cannoli was top notch.  Simply the best.Right here in Phoenix, on one night, I had one of the best meals ever.  I cannot wait to return.  I only open they were open past 6pm.~~#~1
Just a quick review to get the ball rolling. Popped in here on opening night, and was pleasantly surprised. Hubby and I split the Mussaman, a hearty portion of curried veggies and short-ribs, and the Garlic Veggies with tofu. The Mussaman was by far the star, and given it's $16 entree price it needed to be. I see a lot of promise here, though I do find the prices to be rather high for this neighborhood. I should hope once they get their liquor license (expected sometime in January according to the waitress) that the food prices will come down. I'm not holding my breath on this one, however, since the moniker "Modern Thai" has become euphemism for "Expensive Thai." I look forward to trying SaBai again after they've had some time to coalesce.~~#~0
One stop has one goal and that is to get the $80. diagnosis fee and split.  Francisco told me i needed to spend over $1300. for parts the manufacturer only charges $316 for. Stay away! I intend to file a complaint with the Attorney Generals office today, hopefully they will stop this nonsense.~~#~1
this another place that i would give no stars to if possible. it's been on the corner of mill and university for as long as i can remember, which is impressive since nothing older than ten years has been able to withstand the rent increases, and even more impressive because i don't know a single person who goes there.i went in there one time, for drinks and walked past one of the foulest salad bars I've ever seen. for some reason, it's right by the door. instead of walking in to see a hostess stand you walk right into this brown mess of vegetables.after seeing that first off, i wouldn't dream of ordering food here. the place is also dark and dirty and there's never anyone inside of it.seriously, I'm really curious how this place survives. awesome little neighborhood wing and live music joints like long Wong's get torn down for high rise condos, yet gross, ghost town ruby Tuesdays hangs on the corner of main and main of Tempe. what is wrong with the world?~~#~1
1 star for service, but the food is not ok :( they literally put 4 pieces of chicken on my taco. I let that go & figured was a mistake. When I went again, ordered different item & same result. Little to no meat. I will not be going back.~~#~1
My Fiance and I went here today for the first time. We shared a meat pieand a serving of the largest  Bosnian Sausage dish.      ALL of it was amazing. I cannot speak highly enough of their food. Service was very prompt and the waitress courteous and quick. The food was very reasonably priced and the restaurant itself was very charming and nicely decorated. All over, the ambiance was pleasant. I look forward to returning!~~#~1
Buckle is a really cool store.  They carry both men and women's clothing and they have a huge selection of jeans.  From Silver to Lucky, they're all there!  They also have really cute tops- from casual to dressier ones you could wear out to a club or bar.  It's nice because this store has its own style...kinda casual, a little funky, but definitely different than anything you'd find at Macy's or Nordstrom's.  They also carry some shoes and accessories and the staff is really helpful.  You'll also get a little punch card with your first purchase and after so many punches, you'll get $10 or $15 off.The clothes range in price, but generally, I'd say everything in the store is pretty reasonable.  This location is in Paradise Valley Mall- check it out!~~#~1
Like others, I found this studio through a Living Social coupon.  It is a great studio.  Kim is so friendly and fun.  I would highly recommend the yoga classes.  They are both challenging and relaxing!  It is a small studio, but that gives it a really nice, intimate feel.  I definitely recommend it!~~#~1
I freakin love this place. My favorite thing is to sit and eat facing the counter and watch new people come in and get all confused. Now that's just funny. My first time I was the same way, like what the hell do I do here. Now I'm a pro. Stack it deep and use another bowl for smashing, Soba noodles piled so high it looks like a circus act getting the bowl to the cook. Mmmm....good.~~#~1
So, yea. Kelly's review has me more than a little concerned.  Thinking we won't go back for awhile. Most likely quite awhile.  I'd rather be sure they have that crap taken care of.  Literally.But here's why we'll still end up going back.  It's all about 3 things.  It's conveniently located.  It makes you feel like you're eating healthy (Note - doesn't really encourage healthy eating, more just a healthy attitude.  Keeps the brownies, chocolate pudding, pizza and mayo based salads in large supply) And then finally - Coupons.  They have coupons ALL the time.  ALL the time.  Special note - if you aren't that hungry - don't go here.  Go somewhere else where you can split your meal or take 1/2 home.  Here that 1/2 a plate of salad greens is going to cost you just as much as the guy on his 4th plate.~~#~0
If you want to go back to the future at the movie theater Silver Cinemas is the place for you- I felt like I was in the 1980- the decor LITTERALLY says it all.. I kid you not, I am as frugle as the come and you get & more than you pay for here -($3.00 everyday except for tuesdays $1.50)have I mentioned the minnie arcade? Epic place to relive your childhood on date after drinks next door ...~~#~1
Until Bobby Q's entered my life i wasnt a fan of BBQ anything! made me kinda sad to see so many people enjoying some messy ribs but anyways I i digress...This place has changed my life for the better!. Their St. Louis ribs are fall off the bone AMAZING! and their Mac n Cheese is a must have! I have to admit this place has made me a bit of a ribs snob, if something doesnt come close to Bobby Q's i automatically right that place off.A short review but you get the gist of it...~~#~1
WOW this place is good!  SO good!  And not just yummy good, but intrinsically good.  Check out their amazing list of environmentally responsible business practices - http://essencebakery.com/essence_bakery_environmentally_friendly.shtml !  That, and it's cute.  And it tastes Yummy!  And they are SO nice!  SOOO nice!  And their deserts are just disgustingly cute and beautiful and freaking good.  I almost bought the mini box of 4 cupcakes for just $3.50.  Bite sized so not too bad, but if I bought them today they'd be gone before I got home. I got their grilled cheese w/ mozzarella, basil and tomato on grilled buttery brioche bread with a light and tasty green salad on the side.  It will be hard to not come here every week.  I love that all the drinks are refillable - and it's up to you to refill them.  Coffee, tea or soda, just walk on up and fill your glass.  And I love that it's all so fresh and local!  Important note - You order at the counter, they give you a number and bring out your food.  If you're paying w/ debit card, they will ask you if you want to include a tip.  That threw me.  I'd been in the place less than 2 minutes - how do I know if it's worth the tip - or how much of a tip it's worth??  Bring some cash or plan to deal w/ that question accordingly.~~#~1
What a cool little place tucked away behind a strip mall.  Would never have found this if it was not suggested by a good friend who raved about the cappuccino!  He is world traveler, so, it's a  must try if it's the best cup he's ever had.  He was right!  Don't know if it's in the beans or the care that they take to make it with a fab froth decoration on top.  My hubby and I loved the caramel brulee taste..  My son loved the hot "warm" cocoa.  Yeah, we walked in as a family last night and almost everyone turned our way since we did not fit the hip college crowd.  Everyone was really friendly, though. The sweet young man behind the counter gave my son some micro cinnamon doughnuts and scored major points with the little dude!   We will be back.~~#~1
Jersey Mike's is okay. It's a chain place, and a bit over priced for fast food.  I ordered a philly cheese steak.  It was mostly bread, with a few thing microscopic slices of meat.  A little cheese too.  And a sliver or two of peppers.  But mostly, it was bread.  I think it's funny the people that work here try to make small talk with you.  "So, what are you guys up to tonight?"  I think it would be fun to just try and f*#k with them, and say something like, "Oh you know, smoking a little meth and just chilling with some hookers."  See what they say to that.~~#~0
I was here for a conference and saw their sign for a $10 lunch special which wasn't available that day.  Took over an hour to just get a lunch salad.  The waiter had major attitude.Avoid this place!~~#~1
Love it!!! Wish we still lived in Arizona as Chino is the one thing we miss. Every time I think about Chino Bandido my mouth starts watering. If I am ever in the state again I will drive out of my way just to go to it again. YUMMY!~~#~1
I lived off Salazar Bros my first year of college because I lived right near it.  Must have eaten there twice a week minimum.  I was heartbroken when it turned into Armando Bros because as much as people told me they just changed their name, they didn't.  It was a different restaurant.  I had written it off as another great place gone to the pages of history until I moved near 48th and Baseline, and 'lo and behold there was Salazar's, tucked away in the Fry's parking lot next to a Little Caesars and a clothing outlet that appears to have escaped from the mall.  The interior itself is cheaply thrown together and completely forgettable.  The only thing the employees seem to care about is making food.  And none of this bothers me because they make some damn amazing food for cheap prices.I recommend the adobada burrito with extra sour cream and 2 things of red sauce.  It's pork brushed with a delicious sauce of some sort.  Comes with pico and guacamole.  I sometimes have to convince myself to try something new off the menu.  Brownie points for carrying Pepsi products as well, I take Mountain Dew with my burritos.~~#~1
I have now visited Herb n' Flavors several times. I love supporting local businesses who have sustainable practices. This place uses local farms for their produce, safe from GMO's and pesticides. So, I was already a fan before I walked in! Everything I have tried has been delicious, and the owner is such a cool guy- always so friendly to the customers. The food always tastes so fresh, and full of flavor! They have a little something for everyone. I am a gluten free vegan and my husband has no dietary restrictions. We always both leave happy. I definitely recommend this place. I would like to see their business continue to grow and stick around for a long time! :)~~#~1
We received a Netflix subscription from our daughter for Christmas along with a Roku box. We have the streaming stuff. The video and audio quality is very good (almost as good as a dvd).However---many of the things we would like to see are on DVD only and that would DOUBLE the monthly cost of Netflix (UNACCEPTABLE).Many of the streaming programs are FREE on Crackle and Hulu (not to be confused with HuluPlus which charges).Overall, it is OK but I'm not sure that we will spend the $96/year when our gift subscription is over since a lot of this content is out there for free.~~#~0
Tried them out for Restaurant Week.  The food and service was excellent.  I will certainly be back and loved the atmosphere. We sat at a booth and very comfortably sat 3 adults.  The wait staff was non stop on refilling drinks, bringing more bread, making sure the food was cooked to order.~~#~1
My family and I ate here just a few days ago. It was an experience that left me yearning for more out of a restaurant I have seen so crowded over the years and decided to try with a group of 7 of us in the family. First off we got there at 10 am and were missing only two in our party so we had to wait to be seated which was fine. Once the rest of our party showed up at 10:07 we were not seated until after 10:30. When we were seated we were all scrunched together at a medium sized table that would comfortable seat 5 adults. Well, there were 7 of us total and needless to say it was very tight! The waitress stated that we could take our water and go wait back up front for a bigger table but we were looking at roughly 40 minutes of waiting again!!! Seriously? We ordered drinks first and the waitress brought my father his tomato juice and almost spilled it on him but instead spilled it all over her hand. Then she sat the glass down in front of him with juice on table and all over glass and left! She never came back with a wet towel to clean up her mess!! We all ordered and the food arrived quickly. This was the only part of the experience that was good, sadly to say. We received our food order for 7 of us within 15-20 minutes which was excellent. My uncle and grandmother both had charred toast (it was black, not just black around the edges) . The bacon looked like dried strips of hard leather. Overall, none of us will be returning to this place! It was is so overrated. We are headed back to RANDY'S here in Scottsdale to do our next family breakfast.~~#~1
Spa whore, I am! I work in the industry, live in the industry and have breathed the industry for the last 5 years so I know spas. After a few stressful weeks of work, school and planning a wedding I suddenly remembered I am a better version of myself when I take adult time outs. My "corner", so to speak, was at Joya spa. I just so happen to remember a TravelZoo purchase I made a few months ago for a massage or facial at Joya Spa at the Montelucia Resort in Phoenix.Boy, was I excited! I called, booked an appointment with a male therapist and started to prepare myself for my next great spa adventure. After anxiously awaiting  Sunday to roll around, I finally found myself walking into a Moroccan paradise. The space was entrancing from the moment I walked in. It smelled like a spa and helped to set the mood for my day of relaxation. I was given a full tour of the facilities and allowed to set my intentions with small crystals in a round room, and then brought into a room with a GIANT crystal used to help calm, bring intention and awareness of your visit and to yourself. The woman giving me the tour was very professional and thorough. Though informative, I was waiting for a warm connection from her, and never received it.After being led to the locker room, I changed into my bathing suit and waited in the woman's lounge for my provider to find me and take me back for my massage experience.I chose a male provider. Knowing I had tension, knots and stress I was hoping for a firm, slow, relaxing massage. I have had MANY massages and this one was actually a little disappointing. My therapist picked me 7 minutes late and ended 5 minutes early. The strokes consisted of a lot of rocking and fast movements. Not really the relaxing experience I was craving. My massage therapist was very sweet and genuine in his approach, I was just hoping for something more.I definitely didn't let my treatment ruin my experience! The facilities were amazing!  They were clean and always stocked with towels. I have to say the spa attendants ROCKED!!!!! I could not believe how efficient they were. I observed on 5 occasions (YES 5) every time a shower was vacant an attendant was there to clean it up, any time a towel was on the floor, it got picked up immediately. They worked together like a well oiled machine! And I would love to give them props for making me take notice to the work the do!I plan on returning! I may not receive a massage because of my experience, but I truly enjoyed the facilities and the staff. I'm even thinking of booking a suite for my bridal party to enjoy the day there. In the end, if you know massage the way I do, please beware, you may not get all the bang for your buck in your treatment.~~#~0
It does not get much better than this, fellas.BS West is hands down the best gay bar in Phoenix.Friendly bartenders, cheap drinks, good-looking crowd, great music..it's definitely got it all.Best night to check out is the obvious 2-4-1 Wednesday. Thursdays and Sundays can also be fun if you're into karaoke. Saturdays are a nice alternative if you don't really dig Forbidden or Amsterdam, it's a different crowd.It definitely has a "Cheers" feeling to it... not pretentious whatsoever. Great patios too, especially the back one with the new video screen they installed.Oh, and their Halloween bash is THE party to be at. 3,000 people attended in 2007.~~#~1
I was severely mislead by Frank A's, "It's hot, but the food ain't bad." review.  It was very cold and by far the worst food I've ever eaten.  You would have to drag me here in cuffs to get me to return.~~#~1
I really like this place alot. their pizza's are really different but really good! I wish i could say i had a favorite but ive liked every pizza ive gotten except the portabello mushrooms cause i dont like mushrooms but other than that they have an amazing beer selection! Major thumbs up!!~~#~1
Sportsman's is on top of the game when it comes to wine! The staff is more knowledgeable and helpful than any other place that I have bought wine at before. I didn't feel like I was being judged for trying to find a cheaper bottle and there was no pretentiousness in the air. While I was inquiring about dry resling, one of the vino gurus offered to get me a taste of one from their bar - and came back with TWO samples for me to try! Sportsman's also has a very intriguing liquor section - I enjoy wandering around and looking at all the fabulous bottles I have never seen nor heard of. Several times a month, they offer complimentary wine tastings and special discounts on most of the bottles being sampled.  They also have a full service restaurant/bar off to the side where they have a huge "by the glass" list - you are also welcome to pick out any bottle from their store, they cork it free of charge, and you can enjoy your retail priced bottle with dinner!  The portabello sliders that I had for dinner were amazing and I am still having dreams about them! My one complaint is petty: their website.  Its overrun with text and finding important information is difficult, it also needs to be better updated with their amazing tasting events!~~#~1
Alright, went back last night, felt bad because we were the late nighters, and everything was perfect.  The pizza, the salads and the wine were all so well done.  And what finally brought me to five stars was the crepe with Nuteila and Mascarpone.  OMG amazing.  I'm currently craving it the day after.  Totally beats out the crepe with nutella and banana that I also love...~~#~1
I love supporting local coffee houses and this one is my favorite.  They are always super friendly even if I sit in there for hours studying and only order one drink.  I LOVE their sugar free avalanches!~~#~1
This is one of  best libraries I have ever been to.  I live very close by and it is very easy to stop by to pick something up or drop something off.  This is always a must visit before road trips to California to pick up books for the adults and kids as well as DVD 's for the road trip.  We visit this location at least once a week and the kids love it.~~#~1
Loved the burgers and the onion rings were fabulous!  This place is a must visi if you are in the Phoenix area anytime soon!~~#~1
I don't like mega-chain pizza.  I don't like Domino's.  I don't care for Papa John's.  I've never had Hungry Howie's because frankly on their flyers it looks horrifying.  And I will never ever eat Little Caesar's again in my life . . . but I gotta admit, Pizza Hut makes a decent thin crust pizzaThere were a few great locally owned pizza joints where I used to live in Tempe.  Tessio's and Boulders On Broadway stand out, but ya know what?  Sometimes you don't want to pay $20 $25 bucks for an extra large 3 topping pizza.  Sometimes you just want something decent for only $10 $12 bucks.  Sometimes you really DO want a decent cheap pizza delivered to your door in 30 minutes or lessThe three years I lived nearby, I probably ordered Pizza Hut delivery or takeout once every couple of months, and I've never had anything to complain about at this location on BroadwayPS - the boneless spicy bbq wings are dangerously addictive~~#~0
Would have to agree with Rana A below... I think she said it bestActually, I had several folks tell me this place was lousy before I went... it even fell below my already low expectations...Given that I just left the real Barcelona (in Spain)- part of me was truly crying inside that night. OK, I gotta admit- everytime I tell someone I was just in Barcelona (the city) and they say "you mean the one in Scottsdale" there is a part of me that wants to just pack my bags and fly back...~~#~1
when i worked in retail my paycheck was spent before i got paid. therefore, i relied heavily on coupons and splitting meals w all of my other poor college friends.well, i hit the jackpot. $15 coupon for a FEAST. the picture on the coupon showed everything we would get: a huge steak, shrimp, and lobster PLUS 2 sides. there were 3 of us- this was PLENTY. it was prom night too so we were initally fooled with how popular it was. popular for prom girls with light up clear shoes (not even lying), if that says anything about the crowd for you...our waitress stops by our booth and just stares at us. one of my friend kinda looks around at me and our other friend, then back at the waitress. 'ill have a diet coke?'then our waitress writes it down and doesn't say anything but looks at my other friend.i lost it and started laughing. why isn't she talking to us? this is so weird. we ended up asking for a different waitress, then found out the coupon was a big fat liar. you didn't get all of that. it just says you do but you don't. the food ended up being nasty. probably one of the worst meals ive ever had. as we're leaving susy talks a lot waitress trips over my friend and it was all too awkward bc i couldn't control laughing. awful food, awful service, AND the bathrooms were some of the grossest i had ever been in. if wal-mart ran a restaurant, this would be it.~~#~1
Our company held our fourth annual user conference here, and compared to our previous venues, this one was a smash hit in terms of facilities.  It compares particularly favorably with the doudy, sour old St. Francis in San Francisco, a venue I hope we never book again.The standout quality of this place is the hustle and quality of the service.  Our opening night reception included an array of food service stations with different themes, including a noodle bar that was particuarly well done.  The food was all delicious but what really distinguished this event was the personable, attentive, extra-mile oriented staff.  They were reading the nametags of our 200 guests and calling people by name whenever possible and chatting us up in line to make sure we were all happy.The event coordinators were all over the venue throughout the ensuing two days.  Where at the St. Francis we struggled with temperature and electrical problems and grumpy, uncooperative, disinterested staff, here at the Fairmont, the very few glitches drew aggressive responses by people who cared about our event.~~#~1
Nooooooooo!  Curse the the gods of all that is delicious, for Huauchinango is now CLOSED.  Replaced by some generic grill that offered us some nachos and quesadillas, thanks for that.  So not only did you replace a great eatery, but you also had to throw in a little bit of extra salt in the wound.  So, I don't think I'll be giving my business to the devil grill anytime soon.  Huauchinango, you shall now only be a distant whiff of habanero al pastor memory. You shall be missed.~~#~1
I like Bungalow because its a great starting point for a night in Old Town Scottsdale. Centrally located, any other watering hole is in short walking distance, keeping the options open. Making this bar/grill the main location for your night out might pose some problems:-the drink prices are mediocre at best, so don't expect to be frugal.-the staff aren't anything special.-I didn't even know they served food, so it can't be better than average.-unless you can drop a pretty penny (and look the part) don't expect any good conversation.I can appreciate what this establishment is good for though. Bungalow offers a nice atmosphere to sit and converse with friends (not many locations in Old Town offer the ability to hear normal conversation)...~~#~0
This is my favorite hotel of all time, so far, at least of the Kimpton ilk. I experienced nearly impeccable service and a super comfy bed, organic and local products, a lovely shower, and general happy relaxation. I love that the gym and pools are open 24 hours a day. The decor, half Asian deco and half Southwestern, works works works.~~#~1
Hands down my favorite coffee shop in town. They used to be located inside the Conspire art collective but have now moved into the old Hood Rides digs up the block and it's awesome.Plenty of seating room at the bar and also a really cool little room next door  where you can pull up a seat and hang out. From what I understand there will be seating outside too.Most importantly however is the coffee. They use a special mix roasted specially by Cartel. I'll be the first to admit I'm no coffee connoisseur but I do know this, every drink I've had, no matter who's behind the bar has been perfect. Not burnt, not too sweet, and not a hint of pretentiousness.Sooooo, why go to S-word Bucks when you can get a better cup of coffee up the street. Oh and for those of us who burn the midnight oil on more than a few occasions, they're open until 12am EVERY night.~~#~1
Tacos, tacos, tacos......how can something so simple be this great? Having seen this place being featured on DDD we had to try it out and it was worth every penny! I have a thing for always trying the "odd" menu items so I've tried the tongue tacos and cabeza (head/cheek) burrito and to me there is nothing better on the menu! This place is rather small which makes it perfect if you're there with some friends or a special someone! My friend loves the shrimp ceviche though I havent tried it myself. Go to this place for some great authentic, local and quite tasty food.......probably some of the best the east alley has to offer!~~#~1
This past weekend I went to The Vig Uptown twice because it was that  good. This is a perfect place to hangout with friends and get a bite to eat with a really great drink menu. What I love most about this place is that it is very modern and the people are pretty chill. The cherry on top is the games they have to offer, Bocce and Bags!Drinks1. Moscow Mule is a perfect nice refreshing drink to order, made with Vodka/Ginger beer and fresh lime juice. 2. If you bring in your own "pimp cup" any size, They will fill it up with the mixed drink called Pimms Cup.Food1. VigAzz burger is my favorite food item to order because the pretzel bread is amazing.2. Thai spicy Vings here are probably one of my favorite wings that i've ever had so I highly recommend getting them.~~#~1
Hands-down my favorite pizza place in the East Valley.  I have been going to Sourdough pizza for close to 15 years, and it is consistently delicious.  I grew up in Mesa, now live in Phoenix, but I make it a point to visit Sourdough Pizza when I am in the Mesa area.  The decor definitely leaves something to be desired, as they are in a stucco strip mall, and their interior probably has not been updated  all that much in the 15 years I've been there.  But I could care less when the food and prices are this good.~~#~1
HELLISH HELLISH SUMMER WEATHER (March thru October)it hurts my lungs to breath.I couldn't get transcripts because I had a parking ticket I needed to pay.The problem is... *i DON'T OWN A CAR, I don't drive, I don't even have a drivers license*!!~*~*-- aside from that one minor incident,~*~*I paid 9000 USD a semester to receive a so and so education.I graduated with a magna cum laude. I have attended other universities. However, I couldn't help but notice the gap in the quality and variety of classes offered.For example, you have to be a finance major to take upper level interesting finance classes.Business school was so and so, a lot of repetition.Very little hands-on and help with internships.Way too much groupwork and free-riding.They do not have many good employers at their semi annual recruiting events.Oh, and professors rarely teach the courses.They have their teaching assistants teach us.Also, there is a lack of bridging classes between lower level and upper level classes. Junior year when you get admitted into the "professional program" the level of the classes and transition isn't too smooth.The campus tutoring program is pretty helpful for general classes if you're having trouble with classes (usually lower level)There are not enough chairs/desks in some classes.The students sit on the floor and cram on the stairs in the lecture halls.Also, the classes don't teach you how to think critically, which I think is crucial in college.Please don't waste your money, especially those of you from out of state. Its not worth it.Expect to wait in line wherever you go.ASU accepts way too many people.It would prolly accept my cat and my baby sister who barely talks if we threw money at them.Thus its very difficult to get myself into the classes I need.The advisors are walking advertisements of the business school.They are not informed enough to advise you.I got dropped from two required prerequisite courses so I could not move on to the next level.... even after pre-registration.I got screwed and ended up having to take one more semester to graduate.Tuition rose from 6000 a semester in Fall of 2003 to 9000 + in Fall of 2007.Gross!!One thing I liked was the student theatre performances. The admission $ was reasonable and quite entertaining.The College of Architecture and Environmental design studios are pretty good and has good security.ASU is not the most safe neighborhood.I have been approached by many shady people.do NOT live on campus. Especially the dorms on north campus.They are beyond crappy and overpriced.You have to split your room with a room mate in most cases for undergrads.The "freshman year experience" bullsh*t they pull on you, don't buy it.and Please PLEASE please don't move into Manzy Hall (Manzanita; 15 stores with triangular windows).I lived here my froshy year and its the dirtiest (rats), unhealthy (mold, pot circulation), most promiscuous place on campus.Again, please don't bother wasting your money, especially if your an out of state or international student. Hope this helps.~~#~1
Tried to get ahold of this dude to no avail. No personal message on his answering machine at all. Website sucks for information to let me know what sorta work or quality thereof he does.I tried to call here @ 6:53pm tonight and again...no one picks up the phone. So fed up with flaky contractors. Do they want work or not?~~#~1
I'm not a fan of ice cream, I just don't find it appealing and it's too high in calories/saturated fat. However I do love frozen yogurt, and ironically it's much less fattening, yet more satisfying. At 25 calories an ounce, Golden Spoon's is the best around. There have a large array of flavors to choose from and they rotate flavors each month, they also have seasonal flavors such as pumpkin pie and egg nog. You also can get more than one flavor combined. They also have a wide variety of toppings to choose from, from gummy bears to low-fat brownies.Even though their yogurt is non-fat and low calorie, adding toppings can quickly add a lot more calories, I suggest going with chocolate or rainbow sprinkles (adds less than 50 calories), or if you like fruit, go with that.~~#~1
Not the newest or the nicest but, everything you need and usually no wait for machines. The staff is super nice and there are magazines to read while your there. If they could just turn up the AC a little bit and put ESPN on more than two of the TVs.~~#~0
Phenom. The food is always fresh and well seasoned. A good selection of Tequila. Every meal that I've had has been just fantastic. The carnitas and the fish taco's are very well prepared. It's fresh, the beans are fresh as is the rice. It averages about $10 a plate but worth it. This is how really good Mexican should be. The salsa bar is excellent: you have about 5 different types of salsa from which to choose. All freshly made. I can't say enough about the flavoring of the meats and fish. Decor is a somewhat minimalist/modern, probably to attract a happy hour crowd. They have TV's for your viewing pleasure. Service is friendly and quick. I've only been to the Chandler location but will start going to the one in Scottsdale. Good food. You won't be disappointed.~~#~1
Bring a flashlight. It is so dark inside you can not read the menu. But the waiter was so well versed we just used his recommendations. We all had filets cooked to perfection and served on a 400 degree hot plate. They recommend the lobster mashed potatoes but did not feel they were worth the price tag.The wine list is extensive and expensive.  If you are looking for fancy this is the place but we went after a round of golf and they were very accommodating . Great special occasion dinner but not your everyday steak joint .~~#~1
These are the best, most consistent donuts in the valley.  I was always a fan of the Chandler location, so I tried this location as soon as it opened.  I was pleased that the donuts were as fresh and as varied as the other location.I don't care if people go to dunkin for the coffee..a donut shop is about the donuts, and I haven't yet had any donuts in the valley in the same league as BoSa.~~#~1
I moved from Philly this past summer and I've searched all over the Valley for a "GOOD" Pizza. After eating lots of tasteless and cardboard pizza, I found Momma Mia when I moved into Arcadia! I love the hole in the wall vibe! Just like home :) The sauce is great and super tasty! The dough tastes slightly sweet and is fluffy..It's what makes the pizza so great and there is a brickoven!! I love it! My husband and I order the pizza/wing special .The wings are so hot and spicy ( we order the hot, but it comes in buffalo and mild) They have an extensive menu of pasta, sandwiches and salads. I want to try their Philly Steak next, but for the time being I still make mine at home. Every pizza place likes to say its "New York Style", but this place really does a NYC pizza. Well the best nyc pizza you're gonna get in AZ, Something about the water.~~#~1
Good, but the salad was not as good as remembered.  Still think its a great spot in scootsdale!~~#~0
Beware the latte. Otherwise this is a typical Circle K. Come to think of it, the latte is probably typical of Circle K as well.~~#~0
food is ok, but service is very slow!~~#~1
I adore all of Joe's restaurants. That being said, I think this one is my least favorite..(which means it's still better than most of the restaurants I've had the pleasure of dining at in the greater Phoenix area.) I got the chicken sandwich and it was okay. I think I could have found something on the menu that I would have enjoyed more, but for some reason I wanted to try it. I think I'll have to try the pizza next time, because it looked amazing. The service and atmosphere were great, as per all the Joe's establishments. I wasn't completely fond of standing in line for awhile to get a table and order my food. Sometimes I just want to sit down at a table and have the server come to me after a long day.That being said, I would love to try this place again...especially for breakfast!~~#~0
Lets just set the record straight here. Zoe's serves Mediterranean just like Qdoba serves Mexican.When I say just like the Q, I mean the entire experience. Walking into the shop gives more of a cookie cutter national chain feel; which is probably because they are in fact a chain of restaurants. Zoe's food was average and unimpressive. I did like the hummus though. Their prices similar to independent and family operated Mediterranean around the valley; in some cases more. I would prefer to visit Cypress Grill, just up the street from this location, they're my favorite Medi in CenPho so far. The staff here was friendly, they took our order promptly and served the food within a few minutes. Don't get me wrong, the food was in no way "bad", per se. I just can't shake the feeling of "I've had better" when thinking about my experience.If you're looking to fill your belly with food just because it's time to eat, this might just be the place for you. If you're interested in a great Mediterranean meal, I implore you to please try something new. I likely won't be returning, we do live in the city of a million restaurants, go out and choose one! (but don't take me at my word on that just made up fact).Happy Yelping Phoenix, now where's my hummus?~~#~0
Very delicious and friendly! They do happy hour every day which is so great! The sushi is always very delicious and the same with their entrees. I love how close this is to my house. We visit this place quite frequently!~~#~1
Marriott's beds are always the most comfortable out of all the hotels I've stayed. I would not recommend Marriott Phoenix Airport for an extended (more than a week) stay, though. All in all, the hotel is nice, and the staff is probably the friendliest I have dealt with in a long time. There is no free WiFi, and you'd think that a chain like Marriott would provide it for free. There are no refrigerators or microwave ovens in the rooms, either.~~#~0
Oh, YEAH!!! Coming to Scottsdale. I have used RedSeven in Tempe and Mesa and excited to know that they are coming to Scottsdale. I work on the roads throughout the valley and have a lot of customers in Scottsdale that I continue to brag to them about RedSeven's Super Quick Service. Getting the job done quick and right and guaranteed to be the fastest to get you back to work!!!! Oh, and they talk to you so you can understand, not computer talk. Can't wait for Scottsdale!!!!~~#~1
I've been hearing about these cheesecakes from my husband and his incessant twitter following and I was really excited to try some of the goods at the market this past Saturday.We finally woke up early enough on a Saturday morning to hit up Matt's and then peruse the market before it got too hot.  We made our way over to the cheesecake table and then debated between 10 or so flavors.  He had key lime and chocolate chip out to sample and I decided to try the key lime.  I was amazed at how natural it tasted.  There was nothing artificial about it, it just tasted exactly like it should.  These are very good, very simple cheesecakes.  I ultimately went with the peanut butter chocolate chip which is extremely tasty.  There are a bunch of different sizes to choose from, all at very fair prices.  YUMMY!~~#~1
The best gyro you will have in Arizona...or maybe anywhere.Love the grocery selection.Everyone there is really nice.And you can buy a BUCKET of dates for like $6.~~#~1
Have the owners from here ever even had a bagel from back east? Certainly doesn't taste like it, and they charge double what they do back east too. No thanks. The search for a good bagel continues, for now I'll just keep having them shipped straight from NJ.~~#~1
I've been going to Jess @ Chace Salon for almost 2 years now and she is nothing short of amazing!!  Cut, color, highlights....she is my super stylist. :) If you are looking for someone to give you a new look, or just revamp a style you're already in love with, ask for her.~~#~1
I've stayed at an Aloft before.  They are pretty much all the same.  My king room was clean, modern, and well maintained.  I went in the winter, but had it been summer, I probably would have taken advantage of the pool and outdoor lounge area.  Even the gym looked appealing, and that's saying a lot.  The major downfall (and I say major because the whole point of a hotel is to sleep) is that the bed pillows are so incredibly uncomfortable.  It is almost impossible to fall asleep.  Someone please get some decent pillows in there!~~#~0
i love this place. very rarely do i get to go out and tie one on. when i do, this is were i want to be at some point in the night. where else can i go and request the cramps? i...love...this...place, it makes me happy. i suppose i should go on and on about what it's like, but i won't. go and experience it for yourself.~~#~1
Hands down a great lil joint! Gotta get the guac, staff is awesome, way cozy and great food!~~#~1
Maestro Chris Bianco whips up addictive sandwiches at his laboratory on Central Avenue. Ingredients are local and super-fantastic. Check out what today's market sandwich is -- if it's oven-roasted pork, buy it immediately. Don't miss the rice pudding.~~#~1
We went here for Mother's Day based on the positive reviews and had a pleasant experience.  Good food, good service, good ambiance.  We came back here for Father's Day and had a very unpleasant experience; the worst display of management I have ever encountered!  Apparently our order was never put in from the server or there was some sort of "computer malfunction' they claimed, but we waited at the table for 45 minutes after ordering, no food, nothing.  The server obviously recognized the mistake and kept checking in with us and apologized for the unusually long wait, (did I mention the restaurant was half empty, I wonder why!) and she did offer to comp our coffee drinks.  But the infuriating part was when we finally complained to the manager because we could not figure out why the ridiculously long wait, she came over to our table, did not properly introduce herself, sat down and pointed to the man-held computer system and TOLD US we had only been waiting 15 minutes.  Really?!?  You're coming over to tell us how long we have been waiting???  It was so rude and disrespectful, she was trying to argue her point to us which clearly showed that the server did not put in our order immediately which is probably why the server apologized to us umpteen times!!!  It was the most ridiculous display of what NOT to do as a manager.  I have been in management and customer service for over 12 years and this was clearly a Management 101 mistake.  She never apologized or tried to rectify the situation, but when you come out to your customers in fighting mode you really cannot rectify that!  Needless to say, unless this restaurant starts to provide better training to their managers and team members, or hires a new manager, we will NOT be coming back here again.~~#~1
Been here several times for lunch and had the pizza. Today my friend & I decided to try the sandwiches. Very disappointing! I had the Roast Beef & my friend had the Turkey. Both were lackluster and smothered with slimy roasted red peppers. If you go to Humble Pie, go for the pizza (and the Happy Hour!)~~#~0
Okay I have found my new favorite "home office!"  I don't have an office for my agency yet so coffee shops tend to be where I get most of my work done.Last week I checked out Echo Coffee for a client meeting and we both really liked it.  Today I returned and spent a few hours working at Echo Coffee on their wi-fi. It was such a nice break from my usual home office at Starbucks.  Walking into Echo Coffee you can instantly tell its a different type of coffee experience.  The environment is very relaxing, music is not blasting so customers don't have to scream over each other, and they have great big couches in the back.  Of course atmosphere and great coffee needs to be in balance and it definitely was at Echo.The coffee is really good and love very fair price for the quality you get (my 2 favs are Cappuccino at $2.75 and $3.75 for large Chai Latte).  My chai latte came in a big ceramic mug.  I don't know about you but there is just something special enjoying coffee out of big mugs and not recyclable paper cups.A surprising first for me is getting actual lunch at a coffee place and was pleasantly surprised to find the food was also really good.  Can you tell I am a fan yet?  I ordered a Curry Chicken sandwich and it was huge and delicious so finished the whole thing.  There was a nice bonus on the plate - Mango Chutney so make sure you get that if you order lunch at Echo.  I would have loved just a bowl of that and bread as its flavor was so good.  I need to find out where they get this from as I want to have it at home. About $12.50 for my huge Chai tea and curry chicken sandwich.~~#~1
I never got a chance to try the food because I was so turned off by the way I was treated. My family and I will be waiting for a table across the parking lot at The Cheesecake Factory.~~#~1
A-OK is right and the hype is not always worth the wait. I will keep it simple since there are probably 500 reviews on the place.Pros:Great Hashbrowns, and made from scratch foodGood specials to keep things mixed upGreat company and serviceCons:Guy up front says a little over 35 minutes but really means an hour and 45 minutesPricey for some dishesInteresting people around while you wait to get inside (street walkers, etc.)the fresh squeezed orange juice is enough liquid to maybe fill up a double shot glassOverall I would love to give this place more stars if I could get in there without wanting to eat a finger due to starvation, and leave a bit more satisfied. Anyone who has eaten at Bryan's in San Diego would know what I mean.~~#~0
Was super annoyed by this Sephora. The first three times I was asked if I was "doing ok?" was not bothersome. By the tenth time I was asked, I really felt like the employees were going to frisk me. I had a baby with me! I really hope I don't have to do any holiday shopping here. I'd rather go somewhere else.~~#~0
Went there last night for their monthly free planetarium show. It was a really cool show that was unfortunately set to Pink Floyd music. After the show the science dept professors had a huge telescope set up and we were able to look at the moon. First friday of every month!~~#~0
This my favorite Chipotle ever!!! It's so consistent and good! No hormones in the meat makes this "fast" food an A+ for me!!! Yum!!!~~#~1
This place is amazing. Absolutely LEGIT. Some of the best shawarma and hummus in the US (Zankou Chicken in LA is a close competitor). The pita sandwiches are stuffed with delicious fresh meat, traditional pickles, and tahini or garlic dressing (depending on preference). Ask for their hot sauce to help spice things up even more. And the Jasmine infused lemonade is crazy sweet, but really good. I love this place, and have been a die-hard fan for over 4 years now.~~#~1
Stop everything you're doing and go get one of their brownies, warmed up, with an ice cold glass of milk. I'll never be the same.~~#~1
Suffered a senior moment today! Did the yelp check and thought this sounds good...the drive was very dejavu and then I discovered why....see previous review! lol .....but to update....the volcano appetizer, sedona roll and Mochi Icecream (which I am becoming addicted to) were all wonderful. Our waitress was also fantastic bringing plenty of their delicious iced tea and keeping the ginger bowl full....a necessity for me. The place was full tonight and I can see why. Question is will I remember?~~#~1
If Star of India (SoI) is named after the historic ship that set sail from Great Britain to India then it is best to declare at the beginning that there is nothing worth remembering about this place and there is little that keeps you afloat in the morass of ordinary fare. Like many other Indian restaurants in the valley, the smell of Indian cooking hangs in the air and permeates every piece of furnishing. The place does not disappoint when it comes to service, it is warm, quick and attentive. The complimentary papadums (Indian flatbread) with homemade chutneys (condiments) is usually the high point of a meal at SoI. Experiences with the order could be as follows: Gobi Parantha (Indian bread stuffed with cauliflower)- The real thing is meant to be fluffy and served with butter but the SoI parantha resembles a topping-less thin crust pizza. Lamb korma- The gravy is thick, nutty with a lot of authentic flavours but the meat tastes pre-cooked. Chicken biriyani- it is difficult to describe the God-food that is biryani but SoI manages to serve a new variation which is nothing more than chicken pieces thrown into a mishmash of rice and vegetables. Disheartenment with the over-priced, sub-standard food could lead to a decision of not ordering dessert. Finally, as observed in other reviews and the menu, if you visit this place then stick with the tandoori stuff and Chef's specialities. However in that case the excitement of an extensive menu will be lost.~~#~0
great 3D Imax theater,,,see the Transformers...very spectacular~~#~1
Here's the 1. 2. 3...1. Great Food. I love hot New Mexico style food. Good job.2. They have a little brewery and make 3 house beers. Unfortunately, they're all shitty.3. They could REALLY improve the service. No Bueno! We'll be back for the food. It might be take out next time though!4-17-11 Update: Some asshole who was clearly affiliated with Arribas contacted me via private message to slam me for my review. I hope the yelp police find you and pull you off the site. More importantly, I hope more people read my review and stay away from this restaurant. Good Food folks, just get it to go! To Bryan L. and the rest of the gang over at Arribas....Go EFF yourselves! You get one star and NO more of my money!!!!!!! Learn how to work, Kid!~~#~1
This is my favorite haunt. Whether it be St. Patricks Day, before a sundevil game or just a place to meet some friends for a quick drink. Gavin and the rest of the peeps are great. The food is the good, whether out on the patio eating bar food or inside the dining room indulging in dinner. This place will always be the primary place to grab a Guinness for me.~~#~1
Not bad. Not super amazing. My cafe rumba burrito was okay, line was moving a little slow but the employees were nice.~~#~0
I came, I Kiltlifted til the wee hours, caught up with a friend who was in town for a few days and staying nearby. Decent enough bar, was able to talk above the music without yelling, no asshatness witnessed and they have Kiltlifter. Service was attentive, a team effort, yet a bit robotic. They seemed a bit overstaffed, and well , just bored. Did I mention the Kiltlifter?~~#~0
I had Thai coffee and thai fresh rolls. It was good. The vegetables were fresh and delicious. Plans to visit again.~~#~1
Delish & authentic! The serving was generous (meat combo fed 2). The injera was good (not too thick/doughy). Spicy and yummy. I would like to return and experience their coffee ceremony.~~#~1
Amazing clothing and fantastic deals! As a photographer this is my first stop for designing shoots when I need amazing wardrobe items. The owners are really nice and friendly and very helpful.~~#~1
The sign also bills itself as 'Santa Fe style' food. Having lived many years in New Mexico, with a family - generations of which are from New Mexico - the cuisine was decidely not New Mexican. It was standard Sonoran.With that said, the meal was quite enjoyable. The enchilada sauce had a nice flavor. The dulce de leche was fantastic. The service was very good. The decor was a little non-descript, but that's OK, All in all, a nice addition to the meager choices for Mexican food in Surprise.  We would probably come back.I had to give it 3-stars because of what it is not. If you are looking for Spanish food - there is none here. If you are looking for New Mexican style-cuisine, you won't find it either. However, if you are looking for a decent, enjoyable meal at a local family-owned establishment, this is a good choice.~~#~0
My husband and I have Been meaning to go in here and see if it was anything like hong kong gourmet, so yesterday for lunch we decided to give it a try. Huge mistake! The food was literally inedible, everything was either too cold or burnt to a char, nothing tasted good. We decided to try the desert and the cream puff (I'm unsure how you can mess that up) was petrified and the cream was so gross I spit it out. The smell of the flan actually made us gag, we had such an awful time I complained to the manager. She didn't even seem to care, and gave us 20% off of a lunch we didn't even eat. We were disgusted by this place, and we will never, ever go back. Don't do it, you will regret it!~~#~1
This will be a simple post...I love indian food, and this is HANDS DOWN the very best in Az. The Chicken makhani is so buttery, so savory...the Chicken tikka masala, the best I ever had. Service is always good, the food comes out fast. It's not super cheap, since you have to pretty much order everything ala cart, but it is worth it. If you go on Friday or Saturday there is also belly dancers. When in rome!~~#~1
The BEST of the BEST!I agree with Daren C.  Killer Burgers, Steaks, Prime Rib and of course ribs.Food melts in your mouth.  Make this your next restaurant stop.  You will not be disappointed.~~#~1
I was hoping for a more adult friendly place. I haven't been here in years, it used to be a gay-friendly hotspot. Now it seems to caters more to families and children. I've heard the restaurant is good, but I haven't visited yet.~~#~0
Like anyone else with good taste, I think this place was better when it was called "The Library". IDK when their specials are, but the first jager bomb was $2 on a Tuesday night, and I'll love them forever just on that alone. There's plenty of space to sit throughout the bar, a restroom attendant, and usually a DJ.It reminds me of sports bars you find everywhere in Glendale, just with a younger crowd.~~#~0
One of my new favorite lounges to go to with the girls.   1. I am a HUGE champagne fan 2. You can smoke on the patio 3. the drinks are great and 4. I LOVED the decor and atmosphere.  My friend and I were at Salt next door for a friends birthday party on a Friday night and decided to sneak next door for a drink to check it out.  The staff as a whole were awesome, everyone was very polite and sweet.  It has that chic feel with all the servers wearing cute corsets and dresses.  The DJ was great as well, fun music that kept the energy level up without making it too clubby and easy to still cary a conversation. Definitely a great new place to sit back and lounge in a place with a fun atmosphere and good service. Yay!~~#~1
After reading the great reviews and getting plenty of recommendations to try Fez, I had the awesome opportunity to test it out last night at my first Yelp event and I am in love!  From the bright decor to the delicious food to the amazing service (I mean everyone who works there actually looks like they enjoy their job and are having a good time!) this place is 5 star.  I love the cozy lounge feel and could easily see myself enjoying several hours of delicious cocktails and conversation with friends.  This would be a great spot for dinner, drinks, or even an event (another Yelp event please!).Highlights:Tasty drink menuFabulous wicker tables and trendy IKEAish styleGreat part of townSexy servers...dangImpress someone: Take them to FEZ!~~#~1
Yes, it is small, yes, it takes time to get your order, but the quality of the food serve is excelent !!! Celina is the name of the owner (not Selena) of this fabulus resturant.  She takes your order, runs to the kitchen and then she serves your order too. I wouldn't say that this is a one person resturant, because she has help in the kitchen.  Very few Mexican resturants in Phoenix serve food as good as this one. The Menu is limited but whatever you order you will not be disappointed.~~#~1
Service was horrible and food was mediocre at best~ won't be going back~~#~1
Can't go wrong with an iced gingerbread latte, hot waffle with Nutella spread and free wi-fi - especially shared with my beautiful wife. :)~~#~1
Refused to call me a cab because I had a phone.~~#~1
Yup, I'm reviewing a gas station. I like the Quiktrip chain in general and this station in particular.I find Quiktrips to generally be the cheapest gas in town. Sure, the Arco sign down the street might say it's 2 cents/gallon cheaper, but then you get whacked with the ATM surcharge, not to mention there's all those bums loitering in the adjacent bus stop.With Quiktrip, the place is well lit, there's always a trash can and window squeegee at every pump, the convenience store is better than most, and unlike most other gas stations, they don't charge you for the air compressor. Oh, and the person at the register will actually greet you when you step inside the door, while managing to sound sincere about it. Is that the coolest thing for a convenience store or what? Bonus: for those of you who enjoy shopping at the Hot Chick Safeway down the street, this is the Hot Chick Gas Station.~~#~1
A perfectly good place for a chill Friday night dinner. I absolutely loved the atmosphere. Matta's has an upper level where every table is set up like a balcony over looking the main level, it feels like your in a courtyard. The only thing it's missing is an open look at the sky. There was also a mariachi band playing during the night which added to the appeal. And to make things really cool (at least to me), they did a Mexican version of the Godfather theme song. Loved it! The chips and salsa came out right away. The hot had a kick to it, but wasn't very flavorful. The mild was excellent, but I prefer my Salsa hot. I tried combining the two, which was only okay. The menu isn't really anything special. It's a lot smaller than most Mexican restaurants, and is loaded with the standards. My girlfriend had a chicken burrito which she enjoyed. I had the chicken fajitas, which were good as well. The food was good, but not great enough to make me run back out. The service was excellent. Our waitress was on top of everything despite the fact that we were on the upper level. We watched and felt a little bad as she had to run up and down the stairs (she usually took the stairs that weren't as visible, but you know what's going on) to get everything for us. I could imagine that if a server were having a bad enough day, they would just make people up there and wait. We just randomly chose Matta's because we happened to be at Mesa Riverview. I enjoyed my experience there. While it's not a place that I'm dieing to try again, if someone suggests Mexican, and we're nearby, I'd recommend it.~~#~0
Tried going there for my 1st visit and they were closed during hours they were supposed to be open.  Have tried calling them a few times during normal business hours and did not get anyone to pickup.  They may be closed for good.  Not sure.~~#~1
Piestewa and Camelback Peaks are the two boobs of Phoenix. They're real, and they're spectacular. Of course, being all-natural one is just a slight bit larger than the other, but this is barely noticeable. Camelback is barely 100 feet higher than Piestewa, whose nipple... er... summit, is at 2608 feet. Climb either one and you can enjoy great views of the other at various vantage points, not to mention views of the city. Although Camelback strikes me as a funner climb, I give Piestewa 5 stars because for what it lacks in the intangible fun factor it makes up with being just a tad less insanely crowded. Piestewa Peak Park also has a number of really cool looking trails that don't go up to the summit, which look to me to be worth exploring some day.Speaking of female body parts, the former name for this peak was "Squaw" Peak. This has inspired one of the most ridiculous controversies in modern times in our state. Native Americans are offended by the term "Squaw", and regardless of the linguistic origins of the word, it is basically the equivalent of terms such as "Negress" or "Jewess". In the 1990s, the State of Arizona proposed ending the controversy by renaming the peak after our greatest political leader ever and the father of American conservatism, Barry Goldwater. The whining dipshits who apparently constitute our voting population rejected the idea. They'd rather continue using a stupid name that has no historical or sentimental value whatsoever just to spite Native Americans, rather than honoring one of their finest citizens.And so, in this decade, Democratic Governor Janet Napolitano put an abrupt end to the whole issue. She gave the sqaw-apologists the finger and ordered the renaming of the peak to Piestewa, after Lori Piestewa, the first US woman soldier to be killed in the 2003 Iraq war and a member of the uniquely-Arizonan Hopi Nation. A fitting end to the debate.NOTE: Even more fitting, the original name of this peak was Squaw Tit Peak, and I swear to God I'm not making that up to be funny.~~#~1
I just love Chipotle. Fresh, yummy, spicy (if you want it to be). And the restaurant was clean a HUGE plus! My personal fav is the chicken burrito, no rice, no beans w/ fajita veggies, pico, cheese, sour cream, and lettuce. Guacamole and hot sauce on the side. So delicious!!! The person who did our order was so nice! It was my friend's first Chipotle experience! She was impressed by how big the burrito was. I'm glad I only live a few blocks away... because I will be back.~~#~1
I love you, Marquee Theatre. Just last night I saw Dashboard Confessional here and it was packed. I have seen many shows here and I have not a single complaint about The Marquee. The bartenders are really friendly, the bouncers do a great job, and the bands they have play here are always phenomenal. Not to mention, the sound guys do an awesome job. I love how big it is in the Marquee, because it allows for tons of people to see a great show. One thing that most venues fail at is keeping it cool inside of the venue, The Marquee on the other hand does a tremendous job of keeping the temperatures bearable in there. The only thing I hate (and this has nothing to do with The Marquee itself) is that I am always standing next to belligerently drunk, annoying girls who can't seem to keep their mouths shut during a set.... Please don't speak... I am listening to Chris Carrabba's angelic voice, thanks. All in all, I think that The Marquee Theatre is my favorite venue of all time.~~#~1
Their food was GREAT! I had the pancit, lumpia, and that purple rice! The price was not bad for the amount of food that they gave you!Even though they had a very long line they were still very fast with service!~~#~1
FINALMENTE!!!Andiamo....FOOD--------Appetizer: Fritto Misto, which is a trio of fried appetizers. For the day, ours included a cheese, a stuffed olive, and whole leaves of broccolini. The cheese wedge was great (I wish I remembered what it was), and have you ever had a deep fried veal-stuffed olive? Very interesting. The flash-fried broccolini took a little getting used to, since the leaves kept crumbling as I was trying to eat them, but still tasty, if subtle.Main: Orecchiette alla Puttanesca. Man. This is the real deal. Orecchiette is the "little ear" pasta and "alla puttanesca" means it's made "whore style". And what a beautiful, classy, yet very vibrant whore she is.The pasta was cooked just perfectly, and even though puttanesca sauce usually goes with a stringier pasta (spaghetti, linguini, etc.) it worked really well with the orecchiette. And the sauce. Holy mother, this streetwalkin' hussy of a sauce with its 12 ingredients: capers, breadcrumbs, anchovy sauce, garlic, olives, basil, olive oil, and, uh, the other 5. The flavors were a perfect, clear-heeled harmony. Nothing overpowered the other. Subtle and humble home food. It really tasted just like something my Italian friends' mothers would cook in their kitchen.As for the servings, when I first got my bowl I was thinking, "oh ok, this is a European serving. I'm still going to be starving after this." And, um, nope. Why? Because I slowed down. I savored my meal, and took my time with the dish. And by the end, was I hungry? Not at all. I really enjoyed this meal. And the serving was just right. Complimentary packs of long breadsticks are also found on each table. SERVICE-------------Very friendly, efficient, and willing to go through the menu in detail and answer any more questions about the restaurant. Dishes were brought out in a timely manner and there was never any rush after the meal was completed to clear the table. And the mood inside Pastabar was palpable. Everyone looked happy, excited, and relieved that the restaurant was finally open for business. And I felt the same for them. SETTING-------------I would say the space was just the right size. Not a cavernous place in the least. Probably the same size as Sens, maybe  even a little smaller. It's tucked away in the very back of the hallway of the building, so much so that I completely missed it when I was IN THE HALLWAY the previous afternoon looking for it. But I like it a little hidden off, actually. The colors inside are warm, with a modern bistro feel. No windows looking outside but I didn't mind that. There is seating at the bar, a few two-tops up front, and larger tables in the back. Selections from different Shins albums made up the soundtrack throughout the dinner, and while the music sounds like it could be incongruous with a bunch of little ears cooked whore-style, it worked. I definitely don't think this is going to be as "scene-y" as Sens. It has a completely different vibe. EXTRA CRIB NOTES-----------------------------* the main courses of Pastabar are pasta and ONLY pasta. No veal parm here. And no hoikey sauces like Olive Garden-y alfredo or a jar of sugary Prego.* It's great* Prices for antipasti range from $7-$11-ish and mains $11-ish to $18. I spent around $26 with tax and a nice tip.* it's great* No liquor license (yet). For now, sparkling waters, lemonades, a number of sodas (including root beer & cream soda). * it's great* complimentary valet awaits the diners, if you're averse to parking close by yourself.* it's great* It's open till midnight on weeknights and 2 am on weekends! What more could you ask for?* did I tell you it's great?ALL IN ALL---------------An awesome asset to the area and I'm very content. And as much as I loved my whoreish little ears, all the other pastas on the menu sounded incredible and I can't wait to try them all. I'm wishing these guys much success and giving them gratitude to finally being open. A few minor kinks to be worked out (and I wasn't as into the appetizer as I was my entree) so it's not totally perfect but they have started out very strong, and it's only Day 2.And here I was thinking my days of giving out 5 stars were over (ok, more like 4.55 and rounding up)...~~#~1
This has by far been my favorite movie theater and favorite movie chain in Arizona.  This location is better than the others I have been to - quieter, friendlier staff.  The theaters are clean and usually not packed either.I love the t-shirt and cup program - and buying tickets at Costco.  I went to AMC last month, and spent a lot more money all the way around and did not like the theater either.~~#~1
If you've read some of my other reviews you'll see a trend. Kohl's Department Stores.....Brewers spring training...... Yep, I'm a cheesehead. (But if you EVER actually catch me wearing a hunk of fake foam cheese on my head, shoot me. Really.) What can I say? I like Culver's. It reminds me of home. It's total comfort food. Got one of their Wisconsin Swiss melts. What other fast food joints offer burgers with Swiss on rye? The crinkle cut fries are always hot and fresh. And tasty. Culver's is known for their frozen custard. What Wisconsinite has not driven past a Culver's, looked at their sign, checked out the 'flavor of the day', and gone, "Hey, that sounds good!!", and quickly pulled into the parking lot? If you're from Wisconsin or the Midwest stop in for a Butterburger and some custard....it will bring back lots of good memories. Like another reviewer noted when he said he felt like he was in Iowa or something.....well.....that's the whole charm behind Culver's. You DO feel like you're in Wisconsin or one of the upper Midwest states. Granted I'm not the best person to review Culver's....I'm a little biased towards it. But if you want a 'different' kind of fast food experience and you've never been to the upper Midwest, it's a heck of a whole lot cheaper than flying there. Give it a chance....see if you like it.~~#~1
Let's be honest, when you walk into a tanning salon if you have high hopes you'll expect to see a nice person behind the counter who is friendly and can tell you the prices for packages and the max times on the beds.  If you have low expectations you'll expect a bored teenager who hands you a price sheet and stares at you looking bored.Walking into the Total Tan I had pretty good expectations based on the reviews and even those were blown away.  Dallas was the person who helped me (I think he's one of the owners?) and he was sooooo friendly and knowledgeable I spent more than I was originally planning but I feel good about it actually.I had looked at the pricing online so I had an idea of what I wanted but he explained things about the beds that I never knew and that none of the other salons I'd been to had ever told me.  He was super personable too, even asking for my name just during his explanations of everything before I had committed to buying anything.  He made sure I knew every detail of the beds, the differences, gave recommendations and was never pushy with any of it.  During our conversation several people came in and he always asked my permission first to take care of them and I don't think he had to ask for their names once, a good sign that he pays attention and remembers his customers.I could go on and on because I was so impressed with his service and also the location itself (super clean, trendy, nice extras in the rooms like baby wipes and extra towels) but I think you get the point by now.  Just check this place out, you'll be happy you did.~~#~1
This place really made a terrible situation as easy as possible.  Our cat was hit by a car or beaten, and my husband found her immobile and crying horribly in pain.  We rushed her to the clinic, and the doctor saw her right away.  She told us our options, but was very upfront about the liklihood that our kitty would pass no matter what we did.  She didn't pressure us one way or another, and left the room so that we could talk privately and make our decision.  My husband asked if they could give her some pain meds while we talked about it, and they gave her some immediately.Once we made our difficult decision to put our kitty down, she brought the cat into a private room with us so that we could say goodbye.  She left us alone and gave us as much time as we needed.  She also let us be present in the room when they gave her the final shot.  At all times the doctor and the techs were compassionate and very respectful.  I was crying and they were very sensitive to my feelings.  They treated my little kitty so gently even after she had passed.  They even sent a sympathy card to our house a few days later.  I really appreciated how they helped us through this difficult time, and I would definitely reccommend them if anyone else is in a similar situation.~~#~1
OK, yeah, everyone LOVES teriyaki, we know!Well, don't so quickly dismiss the other absolutely AMAZING dishes served here!  It may look like a little pre-processed Japanese hole in the wall from the outside, but they're a die hard home-made mom and pop your mouth full of great food establishment!I'd highly recommend trying the Katsu bowl! You can hardly find ANY kind of Japanese katsu in AZ, yet they have an excellent one that's very traditional, but not too expensive! I'd love to explain the mystique of this dish, but too many people think that fried egg with onions and leeks topped over a diced pork cutlet that's coated in panko bread crumbs is too strange to be palatable.  Well, to them I say you should educate your tongue, and expose it to some delicious culture! There's also Orange chicken... This dish is completely the bee's knees. It easily and without remorse makes Panda Express look like a burnt out oil can that a homeless person decided to cook some chicken in over a pile of burning newspapers.Their house beef? Spicy garlic brown sauce and beef with mushrooms? Heaven.  Simple and delicious.And I haven't even mentioned their coup de grace yet.  Their fried rice might seem a little "heavy" on the surface as it's lightly fried with some garlic oil, but it outclasses all competitors.  Paired with their lightly fried shrimp, it's sweet garlic love.  Seriously, their fried rice is the Sean Connery of fried rices.As I've been eating here for far longer than I'd like to admit, I'd have to say I might be a little biased.  But, for the great unique quality and cheap price, I guarantee you're not going to find any better in AZ!~~#~1
From the outside the place looked alot busier however, Not a bad place to go for lunch on Friday afternoon. Especially when it's close to 1pm as the place was pretty empty. My coworker order brisket tacos and they came out stuffed with tons of brisket. She said they they were very good and I will take her word for it as they looked pretty tasty. Now me, I am not an enchilada person however the enchilada de avocado sounded pretty good as it had two of my favorites stuffed in in, avocado and artichoke. I must admit that it was pretty good. I only finished a little bit of it as I had filled up on the warm chips and salsa that was served when we sat down. Yum. So why only three stars? Well It's actually 3.5 stars as although the food and the company were great, the service was a little off. Like I said the place was empty and yet our server either forgot about us at times or was busy doing something else in the back. Nicole, our server was sweet enough but still.... hmmm. Oh well no biggie. It was empty and we did get in and out in under an hour but not 5 star worthy. Will I be back again? Probably as the food was pretty good. Heck the chips and salsa alone are worth giving it another shot.~~#~0
I first heard about gangplank at the Arizona Entrepreneurship Conference last year.  Since then I have been a regular there and the people that co-work or work there are some of the most inspirational ones I know and are passionate about bringing start-up culture to Phoenix area.  The companies that anchor Gangplank are always working overtime to plan events from Gangplank Jr. for kids to learn programming to the Wednesday "brown bag" talks that have ranged in topics from how to pitch to angel investor to a local news anchor talking about how they are using Twitter as a resource for news leads.Gangplank rocks.  Nuff said.@iamtimhardy~~#~1
I'm President of the Local scooter club so I know and deal with most of the dealers Valley Wide. Tylor the GM and team run a good shop. Very friendly. Don't get me wrong, they are there to make money but they are not push. You are free to hang out and ask lots of questions. Good assortment of accessories and they can pretty much get anything.They know bikes and parts inside an out. Service on my Piaggion BV500 has been fast and fantastic. I did not say cheap, but fair.  Actually they had a Buy 1 tire get the 2nd for 1cent event this week. In the past they had a 1/2 price on all their helmets. Got a Scorpion $220 helmet for about $110. Just ask what and when they are having specials.I don't buy the review below about bait and switch, pretty serious accusation. However, GoAZ and Gina over there are good people as well.~~#~1
For quick fast food.. this is my choice.. I usually call ahead and get take out.. Dont expect super friendly.. but its just take out.. not clear table service.. even if you stay.. I always get the chicken salad with sesame vinagrette on the side but I will say, Im not a fan of the pungent dressing.. I get the chile sauce instead.. vietnamese rolls.. and its not so unhealthy.. NOW my friends that usually nosh with me.. hate the foods they get.. they say it every time I suggest this place.. who knows? Since I  havent really tried anything from my norm salad.. I cant say.. but for me its a strong 3..~~#~0
Yep -- still my favorite hole-in-the-wall eatery awesomeness. The brisket sandwich with cheddar and slaw and dippin' sauce was to die for. I ate at the bar and just enjoyed my visit.  Can't wait til I can walk here!~~#~1
Big fan of their SW Chicken Caesar salad and fire roasted tomato soup. My favorite sandwiches are the chicken panini, the turkey cranberry, and the teriyakki chicken wrap. I love both wildflower and Paradise but Paradise Bakery has the best cookies. And although I do not get it very often because its a killer in calories, the chocolate cheesecake brownie is to die for!~~#~0
Having lived in Chicago for most of my life I was more than nervous of what an Arizona pizza experience would be like. For the most part my assumptions were correct - but Grimaldi's is great! We get the margarita pizza and it's amazing. I'm normally a deep dish pizza person but Grimaldi's is slowly winning me over for thin crust. Also, this place has amazing cheesecake - the best I've ever had in a restaurant.~~#~1
Scrambled eggs, toast and hashbrowns.  Simple, basic and just what you want for an early morning breakfast.  It's kind of like having breakfast in someone's kitchen.  I'd recommend starting with (and sharing) one of their cinnamon rolls.  They're big and covered with frosting!  Good stuff!~~#~0
Everyone here is very helpful and friendly.  No matter who I come in contact with I can tell they love animals and care about me and my pet.  The vet calls me himself to discuss my cat's test results.  They also made sure to give me a lot of information regarding the medications they are putting her on.  I feel that my family gets good care from this vet.  We ended up moving about 15 minutes away, but still make the trip to see this vet.~~#~1
No matter where you go in the World if you are wearing an in and out shirt or hat some big guy usually yells out "In and Out Man I love that place" I think that says it all.~~#~1
Had lunch here today after hearing all the colossal raves about it. However, once I walked in, I realized that any semblance of having an authentic Chinese meal went out the window (no offense, my hungry white friends!). I decided to try it out anyway, was seated by a friendly waiter and ordered the hot & sour soup (they were able to sub in chicken instead of pork - bonus) and the waiter recommended the house chicken to me. I asked for it to be made really spicy, knowing full well it wasn't going to be (no one EVER listens to me when I demand the food be spicy - listen, dammit, I'm brown, people). Anyway, that's my issue.The hot & sour soup arrived, and it was excellent. I was happy. Nothing mars a Chinese meal more than beginning it with a bowl of shiteous soup. Then came the house chicken (with string beans added for $1). Steamed rice costs another extra buck - I get annoyed when Chinese restaurants don't make it complimentary, but again, my issue. Anyway, the chicken was just ok. Nothing amazing and it still ended up feeling pretty heavy. So that dish I'm more willing to give it 2.5 stars. So why did I bump up the star wattage? I guess the service. The waiter:* noticed I wasn't devouring my dish and offered to switch it for any other dish of my choice, no extra charge. Who does this nowadays - in a Chinese restaurant no less? Extra star.* is from the SF Bay Area like myself, so he gave me the lowdown for good Asian food in Phoenix (for dimsum he recommended Golden Buddha first, Great Wall second, C-Fu third - then for Vietnamese he recommended some place on 19th Ave between Indian School & Camelback.) He agreed that Thai, Korean, and sushi in Phoenix is kind of a letdown compared to California, but almost all the Asian restaurants (he admitted, including China Chili) cater to their core customers, who by sheer demographics are pretty much not Asian. That said, he told me that China Chili is THE place people go to for Chinese food, including Chris Bianco (of Pizzeria Bianco), the mayor, folks from Channel 10 news, the owner of the Diamondbacks, etc. etc. So take that for what you will.* When I asked if this China Chili was affiliated with..."oh, the one in Fremont? No. But people say that place is good and fancy and has an electric piano." Bonus points for knowing that.Anyway, he recommended I come back and get the Mongolian beef next time, which I'll definitely do, plus the hot & sour soup. I didn't mind the big open seating area - many Chinese restaurants in SF are like this, loud and raucous. All in all, China Chili is a case where service overcame the food (again, how often does that happen?) to come back and give it another shot. And there you have it.~~#~0
a bit too sweet (sweeter than Yogurtland and Red Mango), but liked the skinny mango and blueberry flavors, excellent spread of toppings (incl. green tea mochi) and great quality fruit. perfect stop-in on Mill.~~#~0
Very VERY average. Actually disappointed in the braciole. Kelsey with the pretty smile and form fitting shorts would probably make me think about going back and trying something different.~~#~0
Video Paradise is great.  For those who aren't financially comfortable enough for the monthly payment to maintain a NetFlix account, or when you don't feel like buying something from Amazon.com, Video Paradise is a wonderful substitute if you want to get something that you know won't be at Blockbuster or Hollywood Video.The selection is staggering.  I remember the first time I stepped in, I was amazed.  The only movie I really wanted to see and they didn't have was The Helstrom Chronicle, but that's okay.  I'm not going to ding this place because they didn't have it.  "You didn't have The Helstrom Chronicle?  Lame!"  I mean, come on.  No one else has it.  This place had it all, from little indie films to gross-out horror films I had long forgotten from my disturbing adolescence (Cannibal Holocaust, Faces of Death, etc.).  They even had the worst movie I'd ever seen in my life:  Hard Rock Zombies.The décor is that of sheer, unbridled love for cinema.  You can easily spend hours and hours browsing through their selection.~~#~1
Finally tried Sucker Punch Sally's today and I think it has promise.  They are still on the small opening menu so the lunch choices were limited but I had the pork tenderloin sandwich and must say I was impressed.  Obviously made in house and not frozen, nice sized portion and very tasty, almost like a German schnitzel.  The fries were so-so, I don't care much for fresh cut fries as they are usually limp like these were.  Will definitely give them another try for breakfast and when they get the full menu going in a few weeks.  Nice vibe and the waitress was very friendly.  If you live in the area and have been thinking about it, give them a try.~~#~0
We visited for the annual Local First Fall Festival. There was no parking available, so we had to go across the street. There were also too many people, so crowding and navigation were problematic. There were a good number of tents offering free samples. It was great to try food from several local places, since we got to discover new places to visit later. Unfortunately, none were selling food, so we couldn't also get lunch on the spot and had to go elsewhere for a full meal. I like this event as a way to try food samples and explore potential places to visit in the future.~~#~0
Weekend plans prevented me from kicking off AZ Restaurant Week on Saturday. So on Monday, Venyse and I headed to White Chocolate Grill where we both had our cherries popped.We started out with the spinach artichoke dip. The blends of cheeses made this perhaps the single most spectacular dip I've ever had the honor of putting in my mouth. O.M.G. Venyse and I were practically clawing at the bowl to get the last of its creamy loveliness. But when you hit a home run so soon in the game, the rest of a meal can seem at odds.However, I was not daunted. She ordered the New York Strip with a side of mashed potatoes (with good gravy...what exactly is that?) and roasted carrots; I the blackened Mahi [*back story to follow] topped with crab and a side of Israeli couscous. We didn't share our protein, but we sampled each others sides. All were very good, but the carrots really stood out. The gravy and the potatoes were good and I loved my couscous. But halfway through here steak and by the last few bites of my fish, we both hit the wall. A food coma was certain. I persevered but Venyse relented and boxed the rest of her meat and carrots.Then came the white chocolate brownie. So sweet, so rich, so topped with vanilla ice cream. It was all we could to to make a dent in it. We both felt bad, because isn't white chocolate supposed to be their signature ingredient? Regardless, this was a terrific first restaurant to go with which to begin. And we both agreed it would be a place in our future dinner splurges. I also must admit I love LOVE the belt buckles. Having about 42 myself, I was intrigued when I first noticed what I thought read "SWAG" after staring for perhaps too long in that general region of one of the staff. (Really super sorry if that creeped you out.) It's actually WCG.[* When a group of us went to Key West one December to escape of the harsh winter of NWOhio and Detroit, we went to a restaurant the listed "Dolphin" as one of its menu items. I asked in a slightly shocked voice if it was really dolphin, to which the server responded it was actually Mahi. 'Oh,' I responded. 'Then I'll have the veggie burger.' Because even in 1998 I was a food bitch.]~~#~1
I waited 45min and ended up with a tiny gross little serving of tortilla with vegetable scraps thrown in it, served in a aluminum take-out box. The tables are folding tables, like the kind you play beer pong on. And they have pictures of kids and babies on the walls and signs asking people to send in pictures of their kids for the walls too, which has nothing to do with Asian/Mexican cuisine, it creeped me out.~~#~1
I am so not a fan of the dentist.  But Dr. Ito and his staff changed that.  Professional, yet relaxed attitudes.  From the moment you book the appointment to the time you leave you feel like are well cared for and that you aren't just a number or a dollar sign.While in the waiting area I flipped through Dr. Ito's "Smile" book that shows some of his work.  WOW!  He makes teeth look real, not like Chiclets.  He does some fabulous cosmetic work!  I went in to have a crown put on and it was quick and painless. So quick that I didn't get to finish watching the movie!   Each chair has headphones and a flat screen that shows a movie (he keeps a good stock of the latest movies.).  Who'd have thought that going to the dentist would keep me so entertained?I've had to bring my son to each appointment as I haven't had anyone to keep him.  Does that matter? Nope.  Dr. Ito's office is equipped with a children's area in the back where the kids can watch a movie, read a book or play a game.  He thinks of everything.I have been recommending him to everyone I meet.  I can't say enough good things about Dr. Ito and his staff.  You won't regret going to the dentist if Sonoran Hills Dental is your new dental office.~~#~1
The best tai in downtown for the price! Masiman is the most tasty dish here!~~#~1
Totally dissapointed.  I had purchased a coupon from TravelZoo, to try out this restaurant, which given its location I would have thought it was going to be very upscale and we were expecting a WHOLE LOT MORE.  The Service was great, but the food, not worth it.  The restaurant itself is very outdated, very 80's.  My husband and I had the crab cakes for appertizer.  They were cold when they were served.  We told our waiter, who in turn told the chef, and the message was passed back to us, that she appologized.   My Husband ordred a 12oz New York Strip ala carte for $29.95, 6 oz of that was pure fat!  and for the price you would expect to get more meat than fat!  I ordered a wild mushroom pizza, which was OK.   This place needs an over haul in a major way, if they want to make any money at the restaurant, which for a Saturday night at 7pm when we went, was empty.  I think the highlight of the meal was the bottle of cabinet!~~#~1
Man, I love Southwest.  Best airline ever.  After a bunch of holiday delays on my way home from a business trip they comped us all a round of drinks.  It's nice to have an airline that can give you a glass of wine to compensate for a one hour delay.  Cheers to that!~~#~1
Really mixed feelings here. Met a friend here on a Thursday about 6:45. Place was busy, but we were able to get seated immediately as it wasn't totally full, and even being not at capacity, it was insanely loud. Naturally I expect a beer bar to have a relatively high volume but this place was ridiculously loud to the point of being annoying.The beer selection was good though I'm not sure that makes up for the loudness and atmosphere that seemed a bit off: really brightly lit, and the decorating was of the signs-bought-new-but-made-to-look-old variety. Almost like a Bennigan's, kind of fakey-like. And why oh why does a place that specializes in beer and seats so many people have just a single urinal and single stall in the tiny men's bathroom? I hate standing in line to pee but than again maybe I'm just getting old :D (as an aside, obviously I have no experience using the women's so can't address that, sorry ladies)I'll try it again though. Food was OK, not great. Probably won't be a regular hangout since it's not close by to where I live and it didn't seem worth going out of the way for considering how many other beer bars/breweries there are around the city with better atmosphere.~~#~0
I went to Susie's for lunch the other day. I got it to go, as I was alone and don't like to eat at restaurants by myself. There was only a few people inside and the food seemed to come pretty fast if you eat in. I probably waited about 20 mins for my to go food. I thought the restaurant was in need of a remodel. But they don't seem like they have the greatest hours, as they close at 5pm. So it is a lunch place, not a dinner place.I got my food and took it home. I live not even a mile from this place. I ordered Sopes. They had shredded beef, lettuce, cheese, tomatoes and salsa. I thought they were very comparable to the ones I have had before, which were homemade. I would like to go back for lunch, but as I'm not home much for lunch it might be difficult! Definitely worth a second chance!~~#~0
This store is banking on the hope they are the only place to buy what they are selling. The mgr at the cash register was not only snobbish and unhelpful but down right rude. It is 12/21/12 I know Christmas time is tough for retail employees but I was at many other retail stores today and their mgrs and employees were extremely friendly. I spend approx 1/2 hour talking to a sales assoc who was very friendly and all was good until I got to register with the mgr and I ended up walking out without purchasing anything. I then went to my car and purchased desired items on amazon while in this stores.parking lot. I know business is good this time of year and maybe this companies business is always good. But the post office and Sears also used to be the king! I could explain all the facts of the situation but I am sure it would make no difference as I am confident this is the culture of this store.~~#~1
Excellent burger~~#~1
Came here instead of Starbucks to get some much needed study time... It's too hot for coffee.. Close to my university ... Has all things berry healthy... I personally ordered the Berry Fulfilling w a free energy shot... Free!! I'll take berries and free any day.. My drink : all berry and only 150 mere cals..& filling.. Actually felt like dessert.. Awesomely sweet staff..~~#~1
I have found my new favorite breaksfast/lunch spot! I love the much cozier and homey feel this place has as opposed to chains like Panera and Corner Bakery. We stopped in at Wildflower Bread Company over the weekend because I had heard great reviews about their freshly baked loaves of bread. We were just going to pick up a couple specialty loaves since we needed bread at home anyhow. Instead, we ended up staying for lunch after we got a peek at the menu and the dessert case. My fiance ordered the salmon alfredo and he loved it. This said a lot to me because he's normally not a pasta person. The salmon itself was really good - soft and flavorful. I had the butternut squash ravioli - one of my all time favorite pastas - and WBC's version did not disappoint. I loved the nutmeg flavor it had - perfect complement to the creamy sauce and the butternut squash. Both dishes came with big slices of grilled toast. The pasta portion sizes itself were perfect. Just the right amount to feel satisfyingly full but not overly stuffed like the portion sizes at Cheesecake Factory or Macaroni Grill. We ended our meal by splitting a lemon bar which also was devoured down to the last crumb.It was a later lunch for us (around 3pm) so it wasn't crowded inside but there were still a good amount of customers so it seems to be a favorite. Service was pleasant and fast and the menu has a wide variety of items that we're excited to go back and try more.~~#~1
I saw this place on a Food Network series in November. When my family went to Phoenix in March for spring training, I knew we had to stop here. It was the first stop after getting off the plane and getting the rental car. It was in a sketchy area in the town, and far enough from the freeway. When we were there, the workers gave us samples of the different foods. I got the chicken fried rice combo with jade red chicken and the pollo diablo. The pollo diablo had a nice spicy flavor, and the jade red chicken was also very good. The snickerdoodle was very soft and chewy, which was a good thing for me. This will be a permanent stop in Phoenix for Spring Training trips.~~#~1
I was so happy to see another station in the neighborhood.  I went in to fill up as I usually do at any station unaware that I was paying TEN CENTS MORE PER GALLON (than Circle K)  because I wasn't paying cash or using a Shell credit card.  Yes, there are signs on the pump but, really, who would think to look for such a requirement?  I've been buying gas for over 40'years and have never seen such a non-cash penalty.  I, and my children, their spouses and our friends will not be getting gas there ever again.  How disappointing and dishonest.~~#~1
This is the only auto repair place I've ever seen with 5 stars solid, and they totally deserve it.My boyfriend has a 1969 Pontiac Firebird that hasn't run in several years. After sinking lots of his own time into tinkering with it and $1000 to the awful Meineke down the street, he gave up... until my car's transmission went for good, and he decided to fix the Bird (yeah!) so I could drive it (yes, I am super lucky!)Whitey's diagnosed it as the carburetor dumping fuel (which is what Meineke charged $500 to replace.. hmmm...). Upon hearing the story of Meineke, Whitey's told him to order the part himself to avoid the markup and they'd put it in for just labor.  Awesome!We took it home, but it wasn't running quite right still, and then failed emissions. Back to the shop it went.Whitey's took it back, spent ALL WEEKEND on it doing various minor things. At one point, they called and said "We've done this, this and this, and it's still not quite right, so we're gonna keep it another day."   I was glad they were admitting they actually felt it to be not right and were determined to fix it, versus just handing it back again... but I was dreading the repair bill.We picked it up Tuesday. The bill? $7. That's right - SEVEN DOLLARS. They only charged him for a spark plug and oil filter. That is amazing to me - I was expecting several hundred dollars for their time.  The car runs beautifully now, and they were extremely pleasant the entire time. I'm taking my alleged defunct car to them for a second opinion next week. I HIGHLY recommend Whitey's!~~#~1
Westgate has a few more restaurants now but stil need more shops for shopping to come along.  It is starting to build up but slowly.  It was nice to walk around from dinner, but the amount of teenage kids there were a little annoying.  Guess I am not the mommy type!~~#~0
Pizza crust & toppings are excellent. However the pizza sauce was too salty. I'm willing to try again later.~~#~0
I've rented from Captain Ted many times, and even gone on one of his guided trips down the Salt River. He is helpful and very knowledgeable and I would highly recommend renting here.~~#~1
Have I got a place for you un-health conscious, frugal foodies out there!  Rocket Burger and Subs serves up huge sandwiches and fried delights for astonishingly low prices, and much of the food is home-made. There's also an enormous section of unusual soft drinks; for instance, there's over two dozen brands of root beer to choose from. Dennis, one of the owners worked for A&W for 8 years, so he probably has root beer running through his veins by now.      I saw Rocket Burger in a listing of new valley eateries, then did a little research. The reviews I saw were all stellar, so I knew we had to give it a try. It doesn't look like much, inside or out - it's in a little strip mall tucked behind Churches Chicken at 35th Ave. and Cactus. But it's clean, and everybody is helpful and pleasant. Ken gave a happy whoop when he saw Cheese Curds ($2.49/$4.49) on the menu. We decided to get an order while waiting for our friends Randy and Marty to join us. The curds came quickly out of the kitchen, piping hot, served with some tasty homemade marinara. They were a touch greasy, as they should be, and the oil was fresh. Marty and Randy arrived in time to save us from ourselves by helping to finish off the curds. Then we took a while trying to make our selections from the extensive menu. Eventually Randy and I both went for the New Yorker: pastrami with homemade slaw and thousand island dressing ($2.99, $3.99 or $4.99). Ken had a homemade-meatball  sub, with more of that good marinara and some provolone. It was the same price structure as our New Yorkers and all the rest of the entries under Classic Subs and Sandwiches. Marty went with a double burger ($3.89, the singles are $1 less). He could have opted for a Rocket Burger - !0 inch sub with three burgers and the fixings in either plain, cheese, bacon, teriyaki, or chili style ($4.99 to $5.99). Of course we had to try the fries and onion rings.     Again our food arrived quickly, served in plastic baskets. It became very quiet, except for the occasional growl of pleasure. The onion rings ($1.99) had been dipped in a thin cornmeal batter which made them nice and crunchy.  The handcut fries ($1.49) were skinny, the way I like them. Randy thought they were undersalted, but I thought they were fine - our usual disagreement. At any rate, they disappeared quickly. Unlike the sandwiches. They were so big that we all ended up taking half of each sub home. The slaw on the New Yorkers was delicious, as was my whole wheat sub roll. The meat balls were nice and tender, and there was plenty of cheese on top. Randy had found a bottle of ginger beer imported from Australia that had a wonderfully refreshing true ginger taste. There seemed to be actual pieces of ginger in it - instructions on the label said to invert the bottle before opening. It never did tell you to turn it right side up again - the Aussies give us more credit than we deserve.      Other food items available: Hebrew National hot dogs in several styles ($2.49), Pizza  Bread with various toppings, Gyros ($3.69), salads ($1.99 - $3.99), a fish sandwich ($2.49) served with homemade tartar sauce. And lots more. I don't know how Dennis and Steve manage to turn out food of this quality for so little money, but I surely do hope they continue and prosper!~~#~1
not clean, worst gel manicure ever and ruined my nails--Jimmy finished it --his wife started it.  Nails sanded too thin and they talk to other people and look away while they'e filing, sanding and cutting.  They cut two times now into the side of my thumb nail, which causes it to catch and tear off the same day, or soon.  Their 10 or 12-yr old daughter brought the colors to pick (she is much too precocous to be customer focused--she's narcisstic and I want an adult waiting on me).  They have to open bottles to look at gel color--no samples.  Gel drying machine is sitting on a priority mail box on top of chair in customer wait area.   Pedicure okay.  Won't come back.  This place like many with Vietnamese want your money, they don't understand service (or cleanliness in this one) and why we really come to these places.  They also try and nickle and dime you on price, for instance give you a deal to take off gel from previous manicure, when you're getting a new gel manicure.  They want to use the dremel to sand your nails down to the quick.  How about healthy nails and return visit.  This place I'm surprised stays in business.  Sadly it's not in a category by itself although the others are cleaner.  Jimmy should stay away from nails and customers, and just keep quiet.  The girl might be cute to some customers but I am not coming to have a 12-year old wait on me.  No thank you.~~#~1
Today I was ready to be beside myself with glee as I took my daughters out for lunch. I've been here several times for breakfast and lunch, and have never been disappointed. They have the BEST eggs!  I also love the layout and of course, the free wifi. August is their "Burger Daze", a different burger every day for the entire month. Today's burger was the wasabi burger, and being a fan of foods with kick, I was thinking about this burger since yesterday. It almost makes me cry to say I was underwhelmed by it. It was a burger with a creamy horseradishy sauce on it, and you got a little wasabi flavor, but it lacked that kick you get from eating wasabi. It also had an Asian salad mixture on the burger as well. Don't get me wrong, it was tasty, but when I think that I paid $11 for that and a side of potato chips, I feel a little slighted. If you eat ten of their burgers over the course of the month you can get a $25 gift card (save your receipts). The burger just wasn't good enough to get me to come back 9 more times this month.  I'll definitely return to Liberty Market again- as I said I do love the restaurant and would recommend it to anyone looking for a place to eat. However I think I'll stick to their breakfasts and other sandwiches. The three stars is for today only- next time I hope to come back here and give them a 5!~~#~0
I've been going to La Canasta for as long as I can recall. I live in Tempe and can't go as often as I'd  like but I go at least once a month. I love this Canasta because they have a green chile salsa and menudo every day! Always quick and fresh. I either get the ground beef tacos (yummy), the red chile burrito (watch out), or the menudo (got a hangover?). It is very consistent and prices, well it adds up, but it is worth it. I have yet to have a bad experience after 28 years!~~#~1
It cannot get any better than this my favorite is mix of banana , hazelnut and lemon. It is quality stuff. If you want something better fly to Italy.~~#~1
Visited the phoenix public market - open air market - farmers market they have on saturday mornings and decided to give mojo bowl a try! They are at the market for food truck fridays also. Check out their website for their usual schedule. They can take cash or credit (with square).I tried their strawberry banana smoothie and my wife had the Funky Monkey (peanut butter / chocolate blend). They were both great quality with fresh ingrediants. They serve salads, yogurt parfaits, and soup also (which I didn't try) but Ive heard their smoothies was where they shine and they did not dissapoint. Give them a try, at $5.00 for a 24 oz smoothie, you can't really complain about the price - its basically a meal itself.~~#~1
Bad customer service!  No one at the front desk for thirty minutes.  Plus they left the phone on the counter so when I tried to call their number, phone just kept ringing and ringing.  :(~~#~1
What's with the cheese?  It isn't even Velveta.  It's liquid cheese food and it belongs somewhere other than on my burger.$5 burger and fries is a great deal IF -- IF -- it's a great deal.  This is just liquid cheese food on a hamburger patty.  McDonald's will do a burger and fries for $5 that's tastier than this dump.~~#~1
what is it with me and pricey phoenix hotels? i swear i don't just give out fives willy nilly or do i have any particular adoration for phoenix.  (sorry phx.) I went to the Valley Ho on an amazing business trip that involved rock stars and the Oakland Athletics, which happen to be my favorite team. it was downright magical. the decor was fantastic, the rooms were huge, with huge tubs, a poolside patio and a comfy chaise lounge. the flatscreen TV had an iPod doc! yaaaaay! (why don't more hotels do this?) the pool was phenomenal. i sat around for days on couches drinking bloody mary's and frozen drinks. the lobby bar had a deadly but wonderful drink called the stardust. The trader vic's attached isn't so hot, but i generally liked all the food i got from the pool bar and the restaurant ZuZus. (room service too- they make their own english muffins!!!)If i'm comparing it to the royal palms, the other phoenix resort i raved about, it's tough. Royal Palms is better for chilling and families; Valley Ho is better for singles. Royal Palms is your wedding; Valley Ho the bachelorette party. Valley Ho had better food and more style, but Royal Palms had a bit more to it and better service. Really, you can't go wrong with either. What is it about Phoenix hotels??? all i know is i am no longer groaning when i'm sent on a business trip there!~~#~1
This is my dad and I favorite lunch spot. Pho-real! Impeccable service and the freshest food. Their spring rolls ate immaculate, fried rice is pretty close to Peruvian friend rice, and their pho is truly unphoghetable. The servers are friendly, the owner always asks you how the food was. Nestled inside the Mekong plaza market this place will meet all your expectations in delicious Vietnamese cuisine.~~#~1
CASH ONLY!  But we easily feed a family of 4 hungry people for less than $20 and it's not Taco Bell.  So with that being said... the Grilled Pork #5 sandwich... oh hell ya... it's good ringing in at only $2.85.  The regular Turkey / Ham on a crossaint is about $4.25 and it's the size of a small football... great value... you could probalby get by with the small croissant sandwich instead for  only $1.95... yeah... it's crazy cheap.  Hot wings are generic prebreaded with a kick of spiciness.   The steamed bun is sweet dough..however, not my favorite... my husband and sister seem to love the egg and meat inside.  The ice cream is all homemade...also another great deal at $.99 cents for a cone... check out the icecream...looks crazy good.  Don't miss out on taking home some baked goods... the baguettes are crusty-soft and warm when you get them.  The croissants are delicious and some of the better ones here in the valley.  I did try and Avacodo boba...had to send it back...not sure what the heck it was...it was green... but didn't taste anything like Avacado... so I did head across the way to Boba tea house for my bobas.  The Viet coffee, also great kick for you mentally if you need a boost, very strong=very good.  Don't miss out on this place... it's a good go to place for a great lunch or snack.~~#~1
Stopped in here on a Sunday afternoon for a milkshake when my sister was visiting from out of town. We browsed the racks of vintage clothing and costume jewelry before sitting down at the bar. It was difficult to choose our milkshake flavor, given the dizzying array of syrups and ice cream combos, but after settling on chocolate and wild cherry, we were very pleased. Plus it was a cheerful looking thing, topped with whipped cream, colorful sprinkles, and a cherry.I was not as pleased with the service... it wasn't busy until after we sat down, but no one took our order or even gave us a menu or a "hello" until we'd been sitting for about 10 minutes. A party of 8 or so, including a bunch of indecisive kids, sat down AFTER us, and were served before my sister and I... and no acknowledgement of the wait. While we waited, I did enjoy looking at all the cool decor from the past, though I think the whole place could be a little bit cleaner.~~#~0
Had a late night plumbing emergency last night. Called a friend who recommended Kevin's Classic Plumbing. Within an hour the plumber was at my home repairing my problem. At 10:00pm my water was back on with kids taking showers, toilets being flushed, and my wife was talking to me again. Sounds great right? Get's even better! The price they charged me for the after hours repair was the most reasonable ever. Last but not least he was a heck of a nice guy. Kevin's Classic Plumbing will be my plumbing company for both home and work from now on.On another note... I had called one of those companys that advertise on TV all day long. They were not able to come out last night and when they did call me they indicated that it was probably not something they could fix and would most likely require a two man crew. Thanks Parker & Son's.~~#~1
I always just get one thing from Vietnamese places and its their rice dish with grilled pork chop and egg cake. This place does it goooood. You get a reasonable amount for the price and the fish sauce is just right.~~#~0
The best fish tacos, period!  And I hate chain restaurants!~~#~1
This is hands down the best burrito in the East Valley! Fav's is always consistent and their prices are excellent! My standard meal is a California Carne Asada burrito, it comes with the most tender carne asada I've ever had. Also, their green and red sauce is a step above the competition, and they have great mexican rice, it comes with peas and carrots! Guac is exceptional, and they also have really tasty breakfast burritos that are available all day. Five stars for being consistent, clean and for having pleasant and professional employees! One more thing is that they close at midnight except for Sunday when they close at 10. Bummer but still the best!~~#~1
After a second visit, the chicken was a little dry and lacked flavor. Quite a contrast to my first visit. Still enjoyed the meal, but wasn't as impressed with the chicken. I'll have to go back to see if it was a fluke.~~#~1
I would be beside myself if Grinders closed. It's about time I wrote a review, since I'm a regular. I can be found sitting on one of the giant chairs surfing on the wi-fi many mornings.I'm the one who brought the plants in. I used to water them a couple times a week but nowadays I'm lazy and they really need to be repotted. I should get on that ...The music is always playing and everyone knows my regular drink ... they've continued to memorize it for me even as I started to slowly decrease the fat & calories of my regular order. Now it's an ice skim latte with sugar free vanilla. I used to get an Everything bagel with egg, cheese and potatoes most mornings. Now I get it on multigrain toast. Eh, it's the little things.The coffee at Grinders is really really good. It's not bitter and sharp, it's smooth. They grind their beans outside many mornings per week. Sometimes it gets too warm inside during the winter so we prop the doors open, but if the grinder is going outside, it'll blow coffee bean fumes in the door.There's some retired motorcycle cops who meet up every morning and sit around the big round table. They often park their motorcycles in front of the place together. They call themselves the Geezerados.There's sometimes a few right-wingers having conversations mid-day. One time I listened to their meeting and heard them trying to come up with controversial topics to get people to come to church. They spent a long time trying to figure out who could get them proof that global warming isn't happening, so they could use that as their hook.A lot of moms come in with their kids. Seeing siblings piled up in one of the oversized chairs together is common. There are a few regulars who come in specifically to sit on the internet all day. I'm not there all day, but I'm there at all times of the day because I have a home office, and you never know when you suddenly need caffeine.Early in the morning and after 3pm the place becomes flooded with Sunnyslope High School kids. They range from ROTC kids wearing pickle suits to trendy girls in neon to the alternative crowd. They often lay around the couch splayed across each other or gazing into each others' eyes. Ordinarily I'm a real talker and I can't usually keep my mouth shut, but Grinders is the one place that I go where I barely make a peep. I just eavesdrop on everyone's conversations and sometimes run into friends I know. I usually go before my brain is fully awake in the morning, that's part of it. For the record, a couple months ago one of the girls there said I was practically invisible and she hardly knew I was there, because I was so quiet.There's nothing pretentious about Grinders at all, and it's also down to earth without being ghetto. It has character. Some months the art is better than other months. Hannah has been there for years (they call her Big Hannah now, only because there's another girl named Hannah who is tiny and they call her Little Hannah) and Hannah rocks and makes the best breakfast ever. I can ride my bike in the morning and be wearing my pajamas and not have anyone really bat an eye. That's the beauty of Grinders. I've seen other people come in wearing their pajamas, too. It's a little bit like the cafeteria in a college dorm, except the people are of all ages and we live down the street from each other instead of down the hall from each other.Grinders has a location inside the John C. Lincoln hospital across the street, too. It's common to see the hospital workers walk in wearing their scrubs. I think they're also opening one at Devry, or they just did. I was frustrated to hear that they tried to open a location at the Art Institute but they were one week too late, Stupid Starbucks had just gotten there. LAME!~~#~1
In my opinion, one of the best steakhouses in town.  My husband and I go here for all our special occasions and have never had one bad meal.  The service is the best just like their steaks.  I recommend the Caesar salad, fillet, creamed spinach, cream corn, garlic and lobster mashed potatoes.  We will continue our tradition and keep coming back here.~~#~1
We have been here many times in the last 10+ years. The Stetson Salad is the best salad I have ever had. The combination of sweet, crunchy, savory and acidic is perfect to me. Lately, I have also tried the Scallops on Beet risotto. The scallops are great, but the risotto just doesn't work, though I love beets and I love risotto.  I have, of course, had the mushroom stir fry, which is very good but very hearty and heavy. Soups have been excellent. The current best desert is that peanut butter brownie. But beware...it is really rich and sweet. I also enjoy the wine flights here. Most recently, I took my 8 and 11 year olds at lunch. Though they were the only kids there, they thoroughly enjoyed the Kobe beef burgers. This is still my favorite place in Old Town.~~#~1
This place literally just opened.  I didn't really know what to expect, but when I walked in the doors I was immediately greeted by Nick, and he was very nice and down to earth.  This is a shop for people who like to garden/grow plants hydroponically or in the ground. They have all kinds of gardening supplies and Nick said they will be receiving their seed shipment from Seeds of Change any day now.  I will definitely be back, as my green thumb (or lack thereof) has been sparked:)  P.S. I was informed that the in the next issue of the New Times, Grotown will have an add to clip out and bring in to save 20% !!Yay plants:)~~#~1
FnB is how every restaurant should be. Unfortunately this will not happen because Pavle Milic, who runs the place, cannot be at every restaurant. This is a small, friendly restaurant in my hood, that just happens to have some of the best food you will find. I always feel welcomed & taken care of by the staff. I've come here with friends, but I've also come alone & felt totally welcome. I like sitting up at the counter, and I've actually met some really great people to chat with there. Pavle & his wife run the place, & they are the kind of people who always make you feel like they are glad you are there.Chef Charlene does things with food that make it amazing, & these are things that I myself could never accomplish. My main cooking skills involve a microwave or a menu. I just wish I had the funds to eat here more often.In conclusion, fabulous food combined with wonderful service make me feel lucky to have FnB in my neighborhood. :)~~#~1
I LOVE Laser for Less (Chandler)!  If you are going anywhere else for Laser hair removal you need to stop now and call to make an appointment with Laser for Less, Chandler.   I wasted a lot of $$$ at another Laser removal place before I found Laser for Less and now I am kicking myself for not going to them first.  If you pay to wax any part of your body you should be lasering that hair off.  It works better, lasts longer, and in the long run is cheaper.  Pros - 1. Free touch ups 14-18 days after your first appointment if they missed 1 hair they will touch up for free.  Never had a problem with them discouraging me, in fact it was the opposite they give me reminder cards so I know when my touch ups are due.  They encourage you to come in.2. They can also charge you by the laser shot instead of a whole area.  So if you only have a few random hairs they will just charge 10 cent per shot on the legs or 70 cents on the face or smaller areas.  You can't beat that deal.3. I am pretty sure they beat or match all prices in town.4. Once they laser the hair, all your hair will fall out and wont grow back for like 2 months, its better than waxing.  Not all laser removal places use the type of laser that does this place does.  That is why I recommend them, it works a lot better!5. They actually care about getting rid of unwanted hair and will go over all their policies with you.  Kristen is who I go to and she is great.  I have been to almost all their girls and they are good. 6. In fact when it was my birthday month I didn't know I got some discount and they back credited me for it, I feel like they are always trying to get me the best deal.  7. They always have deals.  Just last month they had their underarm extravaganza where you can get your underarms done for $30!!! That is so cheap.  They let you buy up to 3 sessions.  I referred a friend and she loved it so much because she didn't have to shave her underarms the WHOLE summer.  8. I love Laser for Less, CHANDLER!!!Cons - never having to shave again, darn.~~#~1
= = = = = = CLOSED = = = = = =After having enjoyed this nice 3-Star place which we regulars called "Eastern Buffet & Tacky Swapmeet" for over two years, I was sad to come up here today & find them gone.     :-(For a similar place nearby I went to New China Buffet today, & enjoyed it.  They're at 2939 N 24th St.~~#~0
Excellent service and food.  Best tex-mex in the valley.~~#~1
The organization is grand with a ton of selection but the employees could care less about costumer service. It is very amazing with the amount of unemployed people in the city they have to hire the most incompetent individuals.... I'm not going to be ignorant and say they are ALL bad, but a few in the bunch seem to make it difficult to be a repeat costumer. Try talking to a manager at this location and you will be routed around the store till you finally get some one that states "the manager is off till next week." i will stay a website purchaser until they change their policy at this location and hire individuals with a better standard~~#~1
This store has the most pleasant employees of any Forever 21 I have ever been to. The girls are always smiling and they take the time to esquire if you need help. The other day, I went in and an employee spent over 10 minutes helping me locate a particular skirt my sister wanted for Christmas.~~#~1
I love cupcakes. Its true. I really do. I have waited in an hour long line outside of Magnolia Bakery in NYC to experience the bakery that started the cupcake craze. That said, if there is a good cupcake to be had, I'm on my way to experience it. I must note- that I am not a fan of Sprinkles; as I think they are overly dry and waayy too hyped.We just ordered two dozen different flavors from Mind Over Batter to celebrate our August birthdays (its a tradition we do once a month from baker's around town). Because of my love for all thinks coffee- I got the Carmel Mocchiato. Let me just say- i wished I took a picture. But I couldn't help but to dive in. Mocha Buttercream frosting-piled high, crushed coffee toffee and carmel drizzle. I also heard rave reviews from the office about the Birthday Cake and the Chocolate Red Velvet. The one I most want to try is the Lemon Drop (because I love lemon).I'll be back in very soon to check out more flavors and cake pops.~~#~1
This is my very first review and I can't say I feel bad for what I am about to write. I took everyones review hoping for a really good hotdog and onion rings like the reviews I read (best hot dog ever, amazing hotdog., etc) oh man were we disappointed.  I'd have to say I'd go to cocstco for a hotdog for $1.50 with a drink.~~#~1
I went today to meet my daughter for lunch.  We are both big sushi enthusiasts.  The interior and atmosphere was beautiful.  Well appointed.The service was excellent.  We ordered edamame, was good...nothing to rave about.  Not much you can do to mess that up.  Drinks were well poured but exspensive for what you got.  Ordered five different sushi rolls.All five were bland, not much flavor and stale.  The fish was not fresh.Paid $12 for a soft shell crap roll and it tasted days old.  Will not go back.Did here they have good pizza and a happy hour at three.  My daughter says to give it another try.  We'll see... I'll let you know if I do.~~#~1
I love this place! Everything about it! The great food, the grocery section, the cramped seating (it gives character). It all goes together perfectly. Haven't found one bad thing yet:)~~#~1
35 minutes... No food. You be the judge.~~#~1
If you don't want to read the whole review, I'll sum it up in one sentence -- Via Delosantos only uses yellow cheese.I went here about 4 years ago for a celebratory occasion, and was afraid to eat the food based on the smell of old grease and the look of the entrees on tables around. We ate on the patio, which is directly on Central Avenue, and after the horrid smell of grease & exhaust pipes, I couldn't wait to flee the scene.Last year, I was unknowingly led back to this same place.  Years had passed, and I had completely forgotten about my vow to never return. This time, I was pleased.It probably helps that upon entering my expectations were very low. I immediately was attracted to the kitschy Mexican artwork, their vast tequila collection on display, and of course, the christmas lights.The salsa seemed fresh and was just the right amount of spice. They keep the chips & salsa flowing so be careful not to fill up.  The margaritas are really sweet, but they're cheap and will get the job done.This is the kind of place where you stick to basics. Don't get fancy or try and order something healthy.  Get a chimichanga, burrito,  shrimp enchiladas, or a chile relleno, and if it's appropriate, get that sucker enchilada style. Be sure to have your Tums handy when done if you think you can eat a whole plate by yourself.The portions are huge and totally splitable.  Oh, last word of advice, don't get the guacamole. It's super gringo, and has a ton of sour cream in it.I'm giving this place 3 stars b/c it's a good value if you're sharing, they ambiance is very comfortable & amusing, and the service is very accommodating.~~#~0
Sooo...if they ask you if you want to sit in the 'lounge'...just say no! Trust me... Artichoke brushetta is good but garlicky which I like~~#~0
Best Chinese food in the Valley. As others have said, salad dressing is addictive as IS available to take home in containers. Shrimp dishes are outstanding with large, plump high quality pieces of shrimp. I have never had even an average dish here. Go and enjoy!~~#~1
Here's the deal. I said I was done with OT, but a friend told me the management had changed and it was worth another shot. My friend was right.Everything I had a problem with before was remedied. I went in unannounced, didn't tell anyone about a previous bad experience, and I was given some of the best service I've received in town. When we went in, we were sat quickly and tended to very well for our entire visit.No texting employees, no indifferent waitstaff. The chef was in the food window expediting food, making sure it went out promptly and correctly. Not only was our server attentive, but there was a team service atmosphere and other servers came by our table when we had empty drinks, debris on the table, etc. The decor has been refreshed, and although I didn't dislike the decor originally, it is definitely an upgrade as well. Now its much cleaner, but still maintains the character that was part of its charm before. Props to the new management. Well done. I'll be back.PS - forgot to order side syrup. Curious to see if they still charge $2.~~#~1
I am not a fan of this place. I like to try to stay positive though so here is my attempt a the proverbial "positive sandwich"Top Bun: The location is fantastic. I really like where it is, its a cute little place that is very easy to find.The Meat of the Matter: The food here is odd. I am very open to trying new things and experiencing different cultures. As I have mentioned in other reviews, I love all types of food from all over the world. I didn't care for this place. I ordered an appetizer that was wrapped in a banana leaf and i honestly thought I was eating an ashtray. It wasn't good. The pad thai that I sampled was very lifeless. I had a friend get a big bowl of soup that looked good but i didn't try it. Lettuce, onions pickles, tomato: The service was not good. I sat at the bar the first time I went here and we got ignored for the most part. The bartender (who i believe doesn't work there anymore, luckily) sniffed at me when I asked for clarification on something. There are also jars of really weird floating things at the bar (probably pickled/preserved veggies/meat/fruits etc.) it was unappetizing to be around....I don't have a weak stomach at all, it was just odd. The second time I went in, the service was equally as bad. there was a table of 8 of us for lunch and the place was mostly dead and I had to go up and ask them to take our order after we sat waiting for 30 minutes. Subsequently, the menu is small and the prices are high with not much room for substitutions or changesBottom bun: I like the owner, he is really nice and friendly. The cooks were also friendly. I like to believe that my taste buds merely didn't care for this place. I know a lot of people that have very positive things to say about this place. I will not recommend it as a personal favorite and I will quite frankly probably avoid it unless it is specifically requested by a client. I am completely fine with the concept that not everyone has to like the same things. I personally have not had a good experience with this place, but I respect the fact that a majority of the reviewers for it have.~~#~1
A bit disappointed so writing after only one exploratory visit and a revisit for the one dish that deserved an encore.The Ossobucco was the major disappointment, A beautiful Presentation that lacked flavor and was past overcooked. One of my favorite dishes when prepared correctly, but they just missed - badly!On the plus side the Gnocchi were little pillows of wonderfulness! Reminded me on our neighborhood  "little Italian lady" who made it for me as a child over 60 years ago and was, until now, the very best I have ever had. This version was very close and was served with a wonderful four cheese white sauce (calorie free for certain!). The Caesar Salad was a decent rendition but nothing I have eaten here approached the Gnocchi, unfortunately.Worth the trip for the Gnocchi alone!~~#~0
If it wasn't for the bad food I would go here more than once or twice a year.  The meat was dry and tough in my first entree and not edible in my second. Now when my wife drags me here to watch a movie, I order a salad only. Because they do catering, I have a suspicion that they serve up left over food from catered events to their restaurant customers.  The service is OK. They have a couple of generic draft beers. Everything is overpriced.  Caveat Emptor if you order an entree.~~#~1
Like many of my fellow Yelpers, I too take issue with the ladies at the MAC counter, but not necessarily Nordstrom's as the "store."  After using my pressed powder compact to the point of "crumbs," I prepared for battle and a trip to the mall.  But, before leaving home, I checked my email for sales and specials.  What I discovered is the best thing ever!  Yes, this is drum roll worthy - so start tapping!  Nordstrom's offers FREE shipping & FREE returns!  Every item on the website regardless of price can be shipped to your door for (in case you didn't get it the first time) FREE!  Needless to say I put down the sword, took off my armor, and ordered my compact online.  I am now "crumb-free!"~~#~0
This was absolutely horrible. I got the supreme pizza with the mystery meats.  I threw it in the trash. I will wait until I get to my destination to eat. Horrible!!!~~#~1
Maybe I'm being generous, but CPK is an okay place for unique pizza. I've always enjoyed their Santa Fe pizza, but this time I thought I'd try their Greek pizza. It was o-k. Nothing special. Too many veggies, without enough meat, cheese and Tzatziki sauce to counter-balance it. What really bothered me was that they sat my sister and me right behind the kitchen. I don't think they should even have a table right there. I saw everything that was going on in there. Plus, I kept hearing the servers complaining to their boss about shit. One girl was saying something about another server "not liking her." I felt like I was in a high school cafeteria. And, to top it off, it was FREEZING in there. It is never a good idea to have it soooo cold, that your patrons want to get the hell out of there to warm up!But, besides my few complaints, it is a fine establishment, although it could definitely improve. I'm sure I'll go back again. But, maybe the next time,I'll stick with my old stand by -- the Santa Fe.~~#~0
Have alread posted a review but had to add that a friend at work ordered vegan chocolate cupcakes for my birthday and they were sooooooo delicious!! All my nonvegan coworkers LOVED them.~~#~1
Yeah...notsomuch.Sprinkles is sooooooooo not worth the wait . Or the chaos. Or the hype. Or the attitude from the morons who work there. Other things that are terrible about Sprinkles include...- The cupcakes are not that great. I ordered two. The vanilla was okay, the cinnamon was dry and chalky and I really disliked it.- This place is a disorganized mess. - There is no rhyme or reason to any of the ordering process. My friends and I were carefully watching the ordering process and we actually think they decided to choose the dumbest and most irrational methods to take orders and dispense cupcakes. Just stupid.- The owners must have purposely only hired people who cannot think for themselves or make decisions. No sane person could possibly work here without being like "um...there might be a better way to do this..."- Also, the employees were rude. Did I mention dumb?So get this: I attempted to order a bottle of water. I told the clerk it's 100+ degrees outside, I walked there and I'm realllllllly thirsty. The idiot at the counter told me "You can order a water here but you must wait for your name to be called to receive the water and pay for it." I pointed out that the water was RIGHT THERE and there wasn't anyone currently paying or using the register. Couldn't she just sell me a water? She said "NO" and proceeded to WRITE DOWN MY ORDER (just the word "water") on a cupcake order slip. She then told me to stand there and wait for my name to be called so she could HAND ME THE WATER and then ring me up.I was all sorts of thirsty and all sorts of moody that day so I got really ghetto on her ass and was all like OH HELLLLLL-TO-THE-NO!" I said "It's quite simple. Just hand me the water and I will hand you money. End of discussion." (There are the actual words out of the mouth!)She looked really mad and also possibly terrified of me and my 5'4" 110 lbs of fury. Thankfully she handed me my water so I did not have to stab her. Which was good because I was waaaaaaaaay too thirsty to stab anyone. I must be properly hydrated in order to commit crimes of passion. And I'm mad crazy passionate about my cupcakes, yo.~~#~1
The BEST SPORTS BAR in chandler hands down!! A great place to meet friends and even bring the kids!! The owners are always around to ensure ur experience!!

Beautiful restaurant! Terrrific service! Wonderful, fresh and authentic cuisine - what more can I say but don't miss the Carpaccio!~~#~1
came out last night with a few friends. The bar was cool, but I'm really not a fan of the crowd in Old Town. The drink prices were not bad, but it was a blast dancing outside. Overall a pretty cool spot.~~#~0
I've always been treated well @ D'ambrosio's despite my not exactly being 'N Scottsdale plastic'. :)~~#~1
Ben & Jerry's is still the best chain ice cream shop! The employees are always helpful and polite, and their flavors are just outrageous! The smell of the waffle cones and waffle bowls wafts out the doors as you walk by, and you can't resist. Whether you go for new flavors or classics like Cherry Garcia and Phish Food, you can expect the most flavorful ice cream with the perfect consistency.~~#~1
Did you know that Malee's on Main offers cooking classes!?  They offer them twice a month during tourist season and once per month during the rest of the year.  I attended two weeks ago, and it was OUTSTANDING!  Not only did we learn to cook Thai (which, incidentally, it was significant to learn that Thai gets its flavor by layering is sauces), but we were given the recipes for some of the signature dishes, served tastings, a meal, and wine pairings, and we were even given goody bags.  It was a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon with another foodie!~~#~1
Even though I've rarely had anything else on their menu except for hummus, I highly recommend this little greek hot spot. They have tons of regulars because the food keeps them coming back. The hummus is to die for (it only comes with one pita however, so I always order 2-3 extra). I have also tried their veggie gyro which is great. I have brought many meat-loving friends here and I've never heard anything but great things about their experience with their food. The staff is completely Greek. They are friendly in their own unique kind of way. Because I usually saunter in with a drink from Starbucks (same parking lot), the female owner assumes I work there and she always asks me how business is going at SB. I corrected her the first few times, but she continued to ask, so now I just keep it going and tell her it's going great but that I hate my job (because I'm assuming I would, if I worked there). I love her personality...very intense. Never smiles, even when a smile would be just right. But she is still very kind. Always look forward to seeing her and eating her food.~~#~1
I came here hoping to catch brunch but I guess it ends at 11:30am or 12pm. Luckily the lunch menu looked just as tasty. We ordered the Luau pulled pork sandwich (the jalapeno cole slaw gives it a nice kick) and the Monte Cristo (french toast instead of regular bread slices = delicious). Service was friendly and attentive. The dining area is decorated like a household- very comfortable and clean.~~#~1
My husband and I enjoyed a "staycation" here for my birthday. We had an amazing time! We took advantage of the great happy hour specials at the poolside bar and at the Sangria bar. The Sangria bar had billiards and a card table. They also had a wonderful Happy Hour menu where everything is $5. Excellent hamburgers and margaritas. We enjoyed a beautiful  dinner at Palm Court and a breakfast buffet at Vista Verde. We took advantage of the free bike rentals and the exercise facility. The staff was amazing and very accommodating. They have definitely earned our business and will refer our friends.~~#~1
Okay, if you actually like the taste of good whole foods and fresh ingredients this place is an Oasis of goodness. If your looking for a place that says they make natural foods but uses 2nd rate ingredients and comes up with recipes to hide the fact by using spices to cover it up your better off going somewhere else.My family took me here when we were visiting, and it is wonderful. I had the Pesto Presto sandwich and it was divine! I also tried my family's strawberry fields salad and Arizona rolls. They were all really good. The vegetables were fresh and high quality and the price for the portion and quality was a good price.I was amazed that they had a couple of options for people on the raw foods diet. The juices are different, but surprisingly refreshing.This place is a great example that eating well and health can be tasty and satisfying.~~#~1
Just perfect !!!  For what it is!!!  Down to the Edison light bulbs from rejuvanation!!~~#~1
The experience we had was just fine.  Food, service and wine list were all good - salad bar was good too.  I am not sure if I'd go out of my way to go back though.  There are a lot of trendy and fun places to dine in the Scottsdale area and this one seems to be like the "Grandfather of Scottsdale Dining" - older and almost antiquated.~~#~0
It's a beautiful day.  Clear sky and around 65 degrees in the late morning!  What to do?  My little guy had been riding his bike without training wheels.  Woo-hoo!  Is he ready to go on a dirt trail?  We're gearing him up to go mountain biking up North.  Hubby suggested Riparian Preserve.  It was an excellent choice.  "This is awesome!"  my little one exclaimed, as he bounced up and down on the trail.  Then, he'll just stop right in front of me without warning.  Five year olds get distracted so easily.  "Is that a wasp?  Look at that hover fly!  What kind of ant is that?  What kind of beetles live here!"  asks my little future entomologist.   We'll be taking some tours and classes the Riparian offers soon!My little one did bite the dust several times due to some excessively gravelly paths.  He learned to either walk his bike over or slow down a bit.  Such a sport!  "Let's come back here again.,  That was fun!"  It was fun for us too!We're so lucky we live not far from here.  It is a very well maintained park.  As it gets hotter, we would walk and feed the ducks in the morning and spend the rest of the time in the Regional Library.  I highly recommend you check this place out.~~#~1
The Thai menu is totally amazing!  I had the Panang; and the coconut curry was to die for.  I have been mistakenly driving past this wonderful place for a year.  Do yourself a favor, try Na Rai, you will be so pleased  you did. They have a lunch menu as well.~~#~1
I (like others) am at a loss as to why this place has such a good overall review. tasteless and awful~~#~1
Tiffany @ the chanel counter. Tana in the lingerie department. these are my go-to girls for everything. i bring all of my purchases to them bc they are THAT much better than everyone else. except shoes because the shoe people know how to work that confusing back shoe room. but everything else: make up, accessories, clothes....all to one of these girls. i recommend you only work with them as well :)~~#~1
I tried the shrimp and chips and they were tasty.  The shrimp was a little salty, but with the dipping sauce they tasted fine.  I liked the "chips" a lot.  After reading the other review I'm nervous to try the fish and chips.~~#~0
Yeah it was good. My wife & I went with 2 other foodie couples, who are good friends, for our monthly "side dish" function.  The food was all fantastic.  All 5 of the other people in our group were drinking martinis, which they all said were very tasty as well, but at $12-$16 per, I'm a little put off.  I'm more of a beer guy anyway, so I had a couple of craft-brews that are not available everywhere, and then settled on a Firestone DBA -- a very very tasty beer -- and had several of those.  Great food, great booze, club music atmosphere is pretty cool. Outdoor area is excellent. Felt like an idiot when I had to ask where the mens room was only to turn around and find that the huge wall of a door was right behind me and said "he" in huge letters on the bottom of the door.  Oh and then (6 or 7 strong beers into the evening) I found that the mirror next to the (only) urinal in the mens room misled me into believing there was a second urinal, which I tried unsuccessfully to walk to.  Why is that guy walking directly toward me?  Oh, it's me.  In the mirror. Dumbass.  So then (after relieving myself in the actual urinal) I go back out to the table to tell the story about trying to use the urinal in the mens room that doens't exist, and somebody else says "yeah the same fucking thing happened to me too!" so I don't feel like such a dumbass anymore.  Fun night.~~#~1
If you happen to get lost and wander by the gun show at the Coliseum, be sure to stop here. A little whole in the wall of a former Wendy's, this place rocks the steak taco world.My favorite is the "jaz". Carne asada + cheese + peppers/onions = yum!!!The barbacoa and chicken tacos are tasty, but I wouldn't say they'd knock you off your feet. Definitely go carne asada and defintely try this place.~~#~0
I love this place! I love that it's to-go only (no 3 hour waits, like Pizzaria Bianco), and the mozzarella is mouth watering. Please try the mozzarella, tomato, basil sandwich. You won't regret it!~~#~1
Ice Ice Baby...Ice Ice Baby...All right stop collaborate and listen;Ice Now is here and it's got my attention Make some drinks - not warm but frosty;And believe me when I say they are not costlyWill it ever melt? yo I don't know.Give them a call and they'll showTo the extreme I yelp like a sandal;Ice your drinks and get lit like a candle... Ice ice babyPS - not sure where the sandal line came in but writing a review in lyric form is a challenge!  This is the best I can do for now...Need ice for an event?  Call Ice Now! They offer free delivery and their pricing is surprisingly cheap.And good luck getting the Ice Ice Baby lyrics out of your head... (sorry)!~~#~1
3/5the sandwiches are huge. i'm not to bent on the whole freedom fries this and such on the menu, but it is AZ so i guess that is how it runs.~~#~0
I love Dr. Scott!! He is the funniest doctor I've ever met and he makes me feel good too! Dr. Scott is always willing to bend over backwards to make sure you are provided the best service and treatment possible. The massage therapists rock too! I will be a lifelong patient of Integrated Chiropractic.~~#~1
Total wine totally takes a crap on Bev Mo. This store has everything! The employees are also very knowledgeable. The other day we went in and my husband insisted I try red wine instead of sticking to my usual Riesling (I don't like change). So we asked one of the employees and he asked me a few questions then suggested a bottle of Malbec. The Malbec tasted amazing! I was so happy. For those of you who don't know, it's not only wine! You can find everything else. Total wine has helped us stock our bar and entertain our guests. Also, don't forget to chill your bottles before you leave!~~#~1
Try the Moroccan Chicken on the low calorie menu.  I was really surprised at how great it is.~~#~1
This is a decent place to go see various types of electronic dance music.  It's not an insane place that will make you want to vomit or gouge out your eyes (i.e., Myst, et al).  The times I've been here, the people here seem pretty decent, though there is the share of ridiculous folks. The bar service generally isn't very good, and you can expect to wait a while to get a drink.  The place is pretty small, so if you're seeing a big act, you will be tightly packed and wait a while to get upstairs (one up - one down when filled).  And be wary, you're liable to get second-hand pepper sprayed from one of the neighboring bars/clubs.  The bathrooms are small, and the Men's has no door on the stall (gee, I wonder why...).On the plus side, the music is usually good, and they stay open past 2AM (wtf is with you people and "liquor laws"?).~~#~0
Wow.Been there 2 times.  I wanted to revisit to see if it was a fluke, and to my pleasant surprise - it wasn't.  I'm from NW Indiana originally.  I know corn.  Indiana sweet corn cannot be beat - well - until I had the corn from America's Taco Shop.  This corn has cotija cheese, hot sauce, mayo, and I swear crack.  There has to be crack in there... I have viscous dreams about that corn and wake up in a cold sweat.  I need that corn... it's just so good.  I don't eat beef and that's the only meat they serve but that won't stop me.  Their vampiro's minus the carne asada, bean and cheese burritos, chips and salsa, quesadilla are all awesome.  They also have delicious horchata.... but that corn.... I know where I'm going tonight.~~#~1
No way around it: this place is overpriced. From the menu prices to the plate-splitting charges to the extra ingredients to the sides. Food itself it good not great.Blue Burger confirmed to me that they use specials and happy hours when they first open to generate traffic, but take them away once they hit the critical mass they want. So don't get to hooked on anything you like about these places.~~#~0
Expect no com TAM-foolery here....this joint is serious about their broken rice business! Endless options of different broken rice (aka com tam= deliciousness)  dishes which typically include shredded pork and whatever type of meat flavors your fancy, all within your $6-10 wallet budget! Service is prompt and efficient, menu is ez to follow, focus your energy on the broken rice dishes; thats what theyre known for. I highly recommend the shredded pork + pork chop + steamed egg combo that comes with a light pork broth on the side. The portion is HUGE and each component of the dish is so flavorful and unique, bringing together a fantastic symphony for your palate. My personal favorite is the steamed egg; there's just something about the soft and moist texture that compliments the broken rice. Go easy on the fish sauce (ngoc mam) they give you on the side (try adding Sriracha to the sauce to add some spice in your life), the dish is by far no means lacking in flavor/sodium. All at a pansy $5.99, I could really eat this all day...everyday!~~#~1
After reading Lindsey's review, I had to think twice about my original review of this place. Yes, I had been back and gave it another shot.Yes, perhaps, I was a bit douchy in my prior review. This place is definitely a great spot if you need a quick lunch, and you are on the go. Its a fairly comfortable place to eat, and it's better for you than a Baconator (although, that does sound delicious right about now).They tend to water down their Sriracha, but it might be more of a heat thing rather than a cost cutting thing. Sriracha can be a bit spicy for some.The spicy chicken bowl is the way to go. Try it. Don't listen to my old review. I was probably having a bad day at work.~~#~0
Somehow while attempting to write an update to my original incredibly witty Sprinkles review, I edited the original review in error, resulting in the loss of my original incredibly witty review, worthy of many UFC's.  Now my 18 fans are stuck with my incredibly less witty new review.Believe it or not, I actually had not been to Sprinkles in well over a year.  Unbelievable, I know, considering I live close by.  Maybe that says something.  Something along the lines of I'm not really anxious to pay more for a single cupcake than it costs me to make a dozen or two at home.  But what do you do when it's August and the thought of adding any more heat to the kitchen just won't do, and yet you really need a cupcake?  Well, you go stand in a line 12 deep to pay $14 for 4 cupcakes.I've been to Sprinkles maybe 4 times now, and they've been pretty consistent.  I do like their frosting, but I find the cake to be somewhat dry and flavorless IMO.  And I'm always surprised by the line here.  Are people that much in love with Sprinkles, or is it that most of the population is not able to read the directions on a Betty Crocker box?  I'm not saying Sprinkles is bad.  It certainly has its place in my life for a cupcake fix, particularly when I know if I make 12, I'll eat 12.  But I wouldn't go so far as to say I'm a fan.  Unless they lower their price to $1, then I'll be their biggest fan.~~#~0
Woo Hoo!  Little Caesars opens in Fountain Hills!  Yummy pizza.~~#~1
Covet is an excellent clothing store.In Arizona, there is almost nowhere decent to shop. unless of course you loooooove Juicy Couture, in the event of which, you should probably not even bother reading this review, because this kind of fashion forward clothing won't appeal to you. Acne Jeans? check.Endovenera? check.Ksubi? check. Nike? check. Covet starts off with an excellent men's shoe section, continues with an excellent men's clothing selection, and finishes off with excellent women's wear. It really is a shame if you haven't been to Covet yet. Do yourself a  serious favor and support a small business at the same time.~~#~1
Boy is the name a temptation.Seriously :)  I'll try to be fair though but I'm writing at a time were this restaurant was truly life changing. So much so that I'm buying a dining room table, additional gear for the kitchen and not frequenting any chain while I'm in my hometown based on the strength of this experience. Even in a good mood this place wouldn't be breaking a 2.5 . I'm not in a good mood.  Texas cheese fries. Pretty tasteless,mess of uncrisp steak fries that are meant to be Monterrey jack , cheddar and bacon. Either the cheese mixed itself together really well or that's not what I had. Bacon , mm that is a very generous term for the toe nail clippings of meat that ended up atop it. Saving grace was only ordering 1/2 an order.Kid's meal.  Holy crap dried and scraggly carrots accompanied the most basic hot dog imaginable on the most generic bun. No refill offered this time on drink, no straw either.   By far the most cynical  kid's meal I've met. Sure make a profit but don't take the piss!  Fresh carrots are not hard to do , with white film on them.. sorry you've just earned a  1 star. Should have walked out, didn't. :( Entrees.Cajun steak . Claims to be marinated in spices that I couldn't find. They may indeed have shown them a picture of the process in the recipe but I couldn't find it. Meant to be medium rare but was medium on one side , rare on the other, close though:) Sirloin steak. Cooked as requested , a bit over seasoned. Sides: Twice baked potato.  If you ever want to open up a salt mine these guy will do it for you. You want an idea of what it's texture was?  Twice chewed would be a better name. Warm vomit with bacon bits would be  a slightly more colorful, and chunky, term.Fried onions:   came with whatever was stuck to the grill they came from.The mushrooms were the only thing that were as tasteful as expected. They looked very consistent though,  canned?   Never mind they were edible: Steak soup,really more a stew,but tasted pretty good.  Overall service was ok'ish but walking the kid to the toilet twice the staff just seemed  to want to get to where they wanted to go and not care for the toddler walking up the aisle to the restroom in front of me.  ( that's for this occasion only , past two times it's been great fun for the kid,)1.5 rounded to 1 for the carrots.~~#~1
I'm not a woman and I don't read People magazines at the gym so I'm not sure I'm really the qualified demo for this place. Nonetheless, in spite of all the hype and hyperbole, it's a good cupcake.  When the Olive Oil Vanilla Cupcakes from the Olive Oil mill are too far away, this becomes the cupcake backup.  Especially the vanilla.I'd give this place a better review but I don't because I consider the cupcake to be the "Rodney Dangerfield" of desserts.  Too many far better post meal options come to mind before I'd waste my valuable calorie allotment on a cupcake.~~#~0
When I was in highschool various clubs used to sell Karsh's bagels around campus to raise money. I would buy a bagel and cream cheese and hide it in my backpack to munch on during class. Soooo good! I was feeling nostalgic one day and decided to pop in for a bagel and cream cheese. The guy behind the counter was nice enough, I told him my order which came to $2.95 or something just barely under $3.  I had failed to notice the sign which said they do not accept credit cards for purchases under $3. I apologized and said I didn't have any cash and offered to run the the ATM.  The guy behind the counter very nicely asked other lady behind the counter  (the owner? manager on duty maybe?) if she would let me use my card. She looked right at me all stink-eyed and said "No" and returned to what she was doing. No apology, no "I'm sorry but there is an ATM at so and so...." Very curt. Thanks a lot personality plus! I will not be returning and I hope you choke on a matzo ball. Shame too, I loved those bagels.~~#~1
As good as it gets for Chinese food in Surprise right now.~~#~0
This would actually be another 2.5 Star experience but I went ahead and rounded it up to 3 stars since I am in a good mood.  We came here after going to Chelsea's Kitchen down the street which was super packed for the night.  I easily get annoyed with complementary valet parking because I hardly ever carry cash and feel weird if I do not tip the valet boys and girls but I digress....The concept and look of this place is really fun and different.  I felt like I was in a modern barn.  We walked in and put our name on the list and was surprised that it is all done by an i-Pad and you receive a text message when your table is ready.  Good thing the bf and I remembered our phones or else we would have been out of luck.  The wait wasn't horrible.  We went to the bar and got a couple of glasses of wine, the bartenders didn't seem really in a hurry to help us which got me a little annoyed.We were seated in a cozy, and I mean cozy 2 top table right in a main traffic way.  My bf and I are not big people and felt uncomfortable in the size of the table.  I know you want to pack a lot of tables in a small space but at the expense of the customer?  Our waiter was friendly enough but not as friendly as he was to the group of women that was seated next to us.... nothing like treating all your tables equal huh?We ordered an appetizer, the zucca chips, which had a decent flavor but were a little burnt.  We ordered out main dishes which were a chicken dish and their version of spaghetti and meatballs.  The wait for the food wasn't bad either but I hate when you as the customer have to ask for a wine list because your wine was empty for 10 minutes but the waiter didn't ask if you wanted anything else because he was focused on the table of 5 women next to us sharing an appetizer.  I had the pasta and meatballs, which was me'h.  The pasta was a little mushy and the meatballs really didnt have much flavor.  My bf had the chicken dish with spinach which he loved!  All in all the experience wasn't bad but wasn't good.  Maybe they are still working out their kinks but this place probably won't be high on my list to return any time soon!~~#~0
Love, love, love! Service is always fabulous and every dish has been perfect. The local cheese plate and AZ wine selections are amazing. I think between the 5 of us we have had everything on the menu, and it was all delicious. This is my fave place in the country right now. Can't wait to go back over the holidays!~~#~1
This place pushes out some delicious food, Red chile burro with rice and beans is better than any I've had, and their Nachos are soooo freaking cheesey and good you'll want to order both for one sitting. Unfortunately only outside seating but cool art work on the building to enjoy while eating and don't be discouraged by there greedy practice of charging for extra hot sauce. But of all things to remember make sure you bring cash the place can't afford a card processing machine which is a good thing other wise I'd be there too often and a fat face looks weird on me~~#~1
First off, the restaurant is dim and dark.. I thought the decor was a little off because they were going for a tropical Vietnam theme with banana trees in there and a waterfall fountain. The waiter there did not have a smile and didn't seem freindly, it looked like this was the last place he wanted to be at. The service sucked ass. I mean come on, there was only two tables including mines and 3.9/4 of the time, he didn't check up on us or refilled our water and we had to walk up to ask for our bill.. like seriously...? Are you that lazy. Bun Bo Hue was skimpy on the meat and had little veggies on the side. Pho had a rancid smell. Noodles in my sister's bun thit nuong were hard and watery (seemed like they were super old) Overall, I wouldn't recommend to ANYBODY.~~#~1
My husband and I have been going here for a few years now. It is one of our favorite places. Really low key, affordable, amazing food! Between the 2 of us our bill is never more than $10 and we are always stuffed! I love how casual it is and the humus cannot be beat!~~#~1
I came here after receiving a free pizza at a Yelp event.  Upper Crust had some of the best food at the event so I couldn't wait to have dinner at the restaurant.  My friend and I came here on a Wednesday and were pleasantly surprised it was 1/2 off a bottle of wine day.  I can't remember exactly which wine we ordered, but it was a Shiraz and it was good.  We shared a happy hour appetizer of mild wings and a large pepperoni pizza with basil.  It was all so delicious!  I also came here a different day with my boyfriend and we shared the meatballs with cheese on top and a large pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and basil.  Again, it was very tasty!   Everyone was very friendly and prompt.  I will be back to Upper Crust!~~#~1
Yes it is bad for you. Yes it is delicious. Great customer service. Clean, fast and predictable.~~#~1
I love pita Jungle! Everytime I am in town, I make it a point to get here. The food is fresh and healthy(ish). There ice tea comes in a variety of wonderful flavors and is so delicious. I would recommend you eat here, especially if you like yummy food with a medditeranean flare.~~#~1
I love the girls there. I get my eyebrows done every two weeks and I get my nails done there as often as I can. Recently, I just did the gel nails (just the gel polish not like the fake nail stuff) and I LOVE it. I can't tell you how happy I am that I did it. I always just did my toes because I'd always manage to goof up my fingernails in the first hour after I get them done- but with gels, you can't do that because after they're put under the UV Light, they dry immediately. No goof ups! Plus, they don't chip. The lady said they'd last around two weeks. I'm so happy with them. It's been a week and they still look pretty good. :)~~#~1
An oasis of little kid fun in Phoenix, we hadn't been in over a year and came for a birthday party.  They're always running a deal, so look for one before departing.  One year we did an annual pass.  It was a good deal.  There are also lots of special events that include deals.  One time we met spiderman.There are lots of rides, mostly for shorter kids.  Some have modest height requirement that exclude the very young and some that exclude the tall.  There's a train, carousel, mini-coaster, tea cup ride, an up and down parachute ride, several rides that go in circles in different vehicles (e.g., planes, cars, and helicopters and futuristic flying machines), and a bumper boats ride that turns into a splash pad in the summer.  Determining whether the adults need a wrist band or tickets is always a little tricky as adults are needed on some rides, but not others, and it also depends on the age of the child.  The place has a little bit of a rundown feel, but kids don't notice and have loads of fun.  The arcade is really rundown, but the ATM is really nice.  There isn't much shade, so be prepared.  All of the staff are really nice.There are usually a few game and art vendors about: ball toss game, sand art, and/or face painting.  All are a big hit with the kids, but also hit up the wallet for a few bucks a piece.  Everyone is a winner at ball toss, by the way.~~#~1
This place is old but the food is good. The compliments arent that great...such as the basil and bean sprouts they give out. Their soy milk is made fresh and does not come from a Yeo's can.~~#~0
If you have been to one CPK, you have more or less been to all of them. I went through a stretch when I really liked it here and I still don't mind it, I guess I just don't get excited about it anymore. The BBQ Chicken pizza is my go-to but the Thai variations are tasty, as well. The appetizers are ok, the service is ok, but it all just seems a little played out to me. I am waiting for CPK to make some moves, shake things up, add something interesting to the menu, because I feel like nothing has changed there since 1992. I'll still drop in from time to time, but I won't be as excited about it as I used to be.~~#~0
I would give this place 3.5 stars.  The service was excellent and the view of Pheonix at sunset was nice.  I ate the wedge salad (nothing special) and the chorizo mac and cheese (yummy).  The highlight for me was the pudding trio, the honey date flan was delicious but the portion was small...which led me to savor every bite.  The other people in my party were satisfied with their food and there were no complaints.~~#~0
Took us a while to find a good Greek restaurant. We have been here many times and have yet to have a bad meal.Gyro combo this trip. Meat was very flavorful and great texture. Tzatziki sauce is one of the best I've tasted.~~#~1
Sushi ken I love you so much, I don't even know where to start! It's about time I write a review. This place in my opinion is the best quality for largest portion size in the valley.  Let me just say now that if are one those people  who A. Like California rolls B. like spicy whatever rolls C. Want to go somewhere trendy and have sake bombers then this is NOT the place for you, please just don't come and spare me your stupid review, just go to Ra or Stingray or somewhere like that.My husband and I eat here a least every couple of weeks, I feel like the staff is our family. They are very nice and polite. A lot of families here, restaurant is decorated simply. Nigeri and sashimi are very good. UNI here is amazing! Yellow tail belly is awesome also love the seaweed salad.From the regular menu I love the yellow tail Kama and the cold soba bowl.I also really like that they are open 7 days a week pretty late since most places in AZ close at like 9.~~#~1
Best BBQ ever.  Go here and thank me later.~~#~1
On my way to the Airport, I decided to stop at Ted's for a bite to eat.  Being that I live really close to this place, and have never tried it before, I thought this would be a prime time to check this place out.Well, it was alright.  Nothing special on the interior, and even though I was not blown away by my experience here, I really did enjoy myself.  We waited in line, and I ordered a jumbo beef hot dog, with Chili.  Austin got a sausage, with some of the fixings, and fries.  We both liked it, and I plan on returning again soon.  Pretty good!~~#~0
We went to American Junkie after we found a 50% discount from http://www.restaurant.com. They couldn't pay us to go back.If you like velvet ropes, not being able to talk to the person next to you because the music is so loud, and being around people who are really into themselves, American Junkie is your spot.~~#~1
There are many places in the valley and its surrounding cities to eat Mexican food; however, there is one and only La Canasta.In the last two years the boyfriend and I have eaten at this restaurant location quite often. For the money, you get exactly what you pay for: a decent meal and generous portions.The chips and salsa are ever-flowing and the salsa is some of the best I've tasted.The wait staff are generally pleasant, attentive and very accommodating. Plus they frequently recall what you had during your previous visits. I recommend you try the Machaca dinner or my boyfriend's favorite dish, the number 5 lunch special.There are multiple locations in the valley, but this one beats them all hands down.~~#~1
I do a lot of traveling and during a quick trip to Phoenix, I was able to get two classes in at their studio. It was very clean and the people were friendly. I did think the studio was excessively hot my second class but everyone else seemed to be ok with it so perhaps it was just me. I would defiantly return if I were in the area again.~~#~1
Evil Place!!!That's right.. I walked in there and I couldnt believe it.  The people were nice to me, asking me if I needed help and by the end of the day, i had a new kitten!All joking aisde, I love this place.  I know you can buy food and other things cheaper at grocery stores, but I kinda like a specialty store like Petsmart.  The staff is great and anything you need they are more than willing to help out.To this day I have purchased two cats here and both are still awesome and amazing.  The last kitten my girlfriend actually picked up and when I went in there to pick up some food, they remembered which kitten we got.  Apparently she was among the favorites that was adopted.  You want good service and a great place for your pets.. Petsmart is the best!~~#~1
I love guerrero's!  I worked in Mesa 15 years ago and we did burrito runs here all the time. I'm a huera, but my Hispanic pals all rated this place authentic.  It's a husband and wife team that runs it.  The best thing are the beans - incidentally, that's how I rate the authenticity of Mexican fare- They are the kind of beans I ate in Nogales during college (at a place I could only locate while intoxicated).  Thinner, lighter colored, and delicious compared to any I've EVER had this side of the border.  I live in PV now- super far - but after this I think I'm gonna have to take a road trip tomorrow to Mesa! Yum!~~#~1
I love the Superstition Mountains! It is the most convenient place to get away from it all. The last time I was there I hiked Siphon Draw up to the Flat Iron. There were a lot of people on the trail but I still felt like I was in the wilderness.  Camping sites fill up fast here, so I would recommend checking out the Canyon Lake area as it is close and a pretty drive.~~#~1
I have never had BBQ in the South, Texas, or anywhere outside of California (except Bobby Q), but of all the places I've tried, Bobby Q is my current favorite BBQ place EVER!  I found this place on Yelp and came here while on a trip to Arizona.  The place was pretty crowded but we only  waited about 15-20 minutes.  We ordered babyback ribs, St. Louis ribs, corn, and mac&cheese.  They also give you DELICIOUS AMAZING CORNBREAD!Everything was excellent.  The St. Louis ribs were the best ribs I have ever had.  They were extremely tender and had a nice flavorful bark on the  outside with dark grill marks.  Their BBQ sauce was equally awesome and the kind I like -- a bit more on the sweeter side, less on the vinegary side.  The babyback ribs were also tasty, but not as flavorful (and less meat of course) than the St. Louis ones.  The sides were good but more forgettable due to the sheer perfection of their ribs.I don't know if I will ever be in Phoenix again, but this place is a must-return if I ever am.  Oh and at the end of the meal, they gave us complimentary, piping hot FRESH cinnamon donuts!  That double-won me over.  I want Bobby Q right now.~~#~1
This place is consistant with it's good Chinese food. The staff is courteous the place is clean. Want Chinese take out in Tolleson come here. =0)~~#~0
I am sad that Lucky's is so far from where we live.  I worked near Lucky's last year and just happened to walk in for lunch.  My lunch was so good I took a huge meat lovers pie home, which was so good my husband proposed all over again!The employees were so friendly and explained that their pizza might take a little longer than normal, but they want to make sure it's right.  I loved everything about my visit there, and was able to stop in a couple more times throughout the year.  It's about an hour drive from where I live, but the more I think about it, I think we're going to have to go get some more Lucky's pizza.  Great neighborhood pizza place!~~#~1
Rarely crowded. 4 tables indoors, many more outdoors. Wifi is usually fast. Only downside is that it's next to a gas station, so the visuals out the window aren't exactly spectacular. But if you care about that, why are you in Scottsdale?~~#~1
Attended the Pink charity event at the Shade bar.  Great time and the scene was fantastic.Need to highlight the job that Jason and Halley do with VIP tables.  I've worked with both of them twice now and the experience is always top notch.  Always ensure that the experience is better than expected.~~#~1
I can't add much to what has already been said....BUT I'll try, haha!Um, don't come here without a map, or some sort of gps device (NOTE: some spots in the mountain do not get good reception, so a map on your phone may not always fully come in). It is VERY easy to get lost!There are many trails, I look forward to getting to know them better. So far, all I have really done is Mormon Trail and the Hidden Valley Loop.....Fat Man's pass is probably my most favorite spot...OH! AND there are some really cool rock formations on the way there (including a natural tunnel) look for the rock that looks like a big mushroom!This is a good area to do a hike in the dark....but don't do it until you've done the trail a couple times in daylight. You can see what seems like the whole valley from up there! If you do the night hike, make sure the moon is full.....you can actually see pretty well with that and the city lights. Plus, it's GORGEOUS! (if you did mormon trail at night, you could start about an hour before sunset, then head back as the sun goes down)Don't forget water, it is a moderate level hike.....and flashlights would be a good idea too, just in case :)~~#~1
If I could eat a southwestern Caesar salad once a day, every day, I think I would. This is one of my favorite salads...ever. Paradise in general is a little overpriced but one in a while, I'll bite the bullet and splurge. My only complaint is their lack of vegetarian options. For a restaurant that specializes in soups, salads and sandwiches, it would make sense to have more than one or two options in each category suitable for veggies.~~#~0
Their service was above acceptable, but kind of slow. It was Wednesday night around 9pm and only one section in the restaurant was open for just a few groups. Their business looked very slow there. But I suppose it was a probably typical week night situation.~~#~0
When Hoa called and said we were having a reunion of former branch employees at a Chinese buffet, I wasn't at all apprehensive. My normal concerns with such eateries--will the food be maintained at a proper food-safe temperature, is this seafood fresh, how long has the sushi been sitting out, will I be able to make it home before my intestines rupture--dissipated because Hoa knows good Asian cuisine. She is, of course, born to Vietnam and world traveled. Let's start with my happiest aspect about HKGB: the sushi. No, it's not the best sushi in the Valley, but they make it fresh for you on site. You can stand there and watch it being make, grab a soup or something else to munch on, or just sit at your table and chat awhile. Afterwards, you can head back for more sushi or veer over to the more traditional offerings of a Chinese buffet: sweet and sour chicken, fried rice, crab legs. Now let's review the not-so-shiny aspect: the price. Yes, it seems a little steep that we paid about $25 per person with tip (and I made only two rounds) but when you factor in the 2 hours we spent there, grazing, catching up, grazing, passing Lisette's daughter around, grazing and making plans to keep in touch, it's really not such an outrageous amount to pay. If you find yourself in this part of town, craving Chinese and are wicked crazy hungry, give HKGB a shot.~~#~1
LOVE Chino Bandido.  The snickerdoodle cookie they give you with your meal is heaven.  Well, all of the food might actually be heaven, but usually by the time I get to the snickerdoodle I could die happy on the spot.~~#~1
I pride myself on being 'that girl' that tries out every restaurant I come across. It's practically a hobby for me. For YEARS I kept saying, "I want to go to Cowboy Ciao" but we never made it. Then, thankfully, the hubs' best friend had a big birthday dinner there, so we just HAD to go. (Thank you hubs' best friend!)I have to say that the service was incredible, and the menu was almost overwhelming. There were SO many interesting choices, but I had to stick to the tried and true chopped salad - everyone and their mother has told me about this salad, and I wasn't about to miss out. The hubs ordered the Tenderbelly Pork Shank. The chopped salad has earned its reputation. That thing is de-freaking-licious. The Pork Shank dish was fabulous as well, but I couldn't get over how great the salad was! AND the server always came over to make sure that my wine glass was never empty. Seriously, can it get any better?For dessert we ordered the spumoni- I have had better (no offense) but I'm not sure anything served after that salad would have made me happy :)I'm very glad we finally made it to Cowboy Ciao and I look forward to going back - SOON!~~#~1
I could care less about being seen in Scottsdale, what my friends look like, and how cool we look when we hang out together. This is why I don't go to this place more than once every two years!!!! That being said, I do like their food. Its pretty good for sushi. But, the music is too loud, its pretentious as all get-out, the staff is too cool for their own good (Hey Bambi... You work in a frickin' restaurant), and its too much of a scene! Can I just have two of the Las Vegas' to go without all the crap?~~#~0
The facility is a bit dated, but the service is great.  Dr. Rios is patient and thorough, and his staff are friendly and efficient.  Dr. Rios gave me several different alternative contacts to try in order to make sure that I was getting the right fit for me - it made a big difference.  Who knew that they make bi-focal contacts now?  They're great.~~#~1
Went wed nite, wife tells me best gnocchi since Europe, were cooked perfectly . I had pollo erbe, terrific. " wine tasting director" very good, with tasty selections. Will be back, OFTEN. Highly recommend. Rich D~~#~1
Our family have used this Discount Tire for 11 years now.  Amazing service and warranty on tires.  Thank you!~~#~1
I can't think of a better Thai rest. In PHX. Consistently good food and service.  They have Thai staples like rice paper rolls, Tom Ka Gai and Pad Thai as well as more creative items such as Crispy Mango Fish. Average Thai food pricing, free parking.  There are a good number of tables, so don't let a short line dissuade you.  Like any rest., scope your table before you sit to be sure it suits your mood.  Boisterous din in the main room when busy.~~#~1
Avoid at all costs. Awful service, slow as hell, only uses disposable plasticware/plates to add landfill insult to heinous food.  Despite telling them we were in a rush to catch a plane and multiple reassurances that the food would arrive in plenty of time, they lollygagged around and I ended up paying $30 to be seriously pissed off and hungry with no food.   BLECH.~~#~1
The new Harkins Cine Capri, one of the first things to open in Tempe Marketplace, boasts 16 theatres and offers more than the norm when it comes to movie snacks. Moviegoers can order brownie bites, mozzarella sticks and pizza.The theatre is super spacious and the seats are plush and comfy. And the screen is huge. This is my new favorite movie theatre.~~#~1
Postinos a spot for high rollin' winos. You woke up at noon and had breakfast during lunchtime, so the next logical step is to have lunch food during dinner time, with some wine. This is where postino's comes in. The menu is full of salads, Paninis, bruschetta and a few apps. There is a large by the glass wine menu ($8-$14) and hipster cool ambiance. Service here is great, the patio is quite nice with heaters, a fire place and even a few patio furniture loungers.  Great for a date, hanging with friends and conversation.We started with the Bella Postino $9 Crustini with a artichoke dip and a hummus. The artichoke dip was great as any fat laden dip would be. The humus was ok but I am a hummus  snob.For our main we had the Vegetarian Panini ($9.75) It was good and moist with hummus roasted tomatoes olives and an artichoke spread, the focaccia bread was well toasted from the Panini press.We also had the mediterranean  salad 8.75 which is a romaine salad with copious amounts of feta. Pretty good as I do like cheese but maybe not as healthy as one would want from a salad.For desert we had a crem burle, simple not to sweet and well executed a classic.~~#~1
Soooo this location is even better than the one in Superstition Springs. They also have a play place, which is pretty cool. I ordered the deluxe chicken and it was simply amazing. Fantastic service as well. I ordered and set my stuff down and within a couple minutes my food was brought out to me with a smile. Very polite staff, and delicious food.... what more could one ask for? I totally wish Chick-fil-A would sell thier Chick-fil-A sauce by the bottle cuz it's sooo good~~#~1
I was NOT too impressed with this place but...  it was good for Phoenix, where I am starting to realize there is NOT an abundance of people who look like me.  =/   LOL! Flavor-wise I thought it was pretty good.  Don't be misled by the spring rolls...  Even though it says they serve them in 3s...  its 3 that are cut in half...  so you get 6 pieces.  This is pretty good if you're looking to share with someone.  I did not get a lot of lettuce and mint, though and ate the last two pieces by themselves.  I was a little disappointed by this.I had the combination Pho...  (YES i braved SOUP it in HOT ASS ARIZONA) and it was not too bad either.  The broth was nice and clear, just portion wise...  was not as extra large as I expected it to be.When the bill came, I ended up paying about $18 total which included tax and tip and no drink.  I think the Pho was almost $10.00 and the Spring Rolls were like $4 and some change?I think this place is cool but would not be my FIRST choice when it comes to pho.  (Trust me...  I've eaten a LOT of pho)  I just don;t think the price vs. portion is worth what you;re paying.  This saddens me to say too because, I am ALL about supporting small Asian businesses.  Oh well...~~#~0

One of my favorite brunch spots.  Not the cheapest, but you come here to admire the Arcadia families/couples coming into have brunch.  There is sometimes a wait but it is worth it.  I have a hard time deciding between the lunch salads and breakfast.  I usually cave and get the french toast or ginormous belgian waffle.  Parking is plentiful but it is on a weird corner in the strip mall, if you are going, look for cork and cleaver.~~#~1
Seriously.  I seldom give 5 stars, but it deserves at least this much.If it wasn't for the location and the super scary after dinner club scene, I would go every.single.day.Truly one the best BBQ places in greater Phoenix.  My mouth is watering as I'm thinking about the Hog Heaven special.  In fact, my puppies mouths are watering too.  Decent prices, giant selection.  One of those places where the early cowboys of the SW would appreciate.   If you are a cracker family, I suggest going super early, like super early bird special early , like when the snow birds come out for the senior special early, because after dusk, the whole place transforms into a pulsating super loud, super dicey Mexican Dance Club, and the blue hairs are sure to have a coronary attack after indulging in such a  lipid laden meal as they attempt to make their way out of the Club.   Ah the sacrifice for decent BBQ....~~#~1
I live in two cities in two different states and travel back and forth each month.  I tend to use services where I find them and haven't really found a  really great barbershop in the last three years.  While I was in Anthem this week, I decided to give Vs Barbershop at Happy Valley Road a try.  I rarely use chains and prefer a more intimate and personal hair stylist, but I was pleasantly surprised this time.  I was able to make my appoinmtnt online and choose the services I wanted to have with the haircut--very efficient.  I didn't know any of the barbers, so I just let the shop (?software) choose one.  I was treated to a superb haircut, a very satisfying shave, and a facial mask and massage.  My barber, Manuel, was precise, experienced, and he went about his business with style. I cannot imagine how many hot towels he used but I would not want their laundry bill. Finally, Manuel washed my hair AFTER the cut, which makes all the difference for the rest of the day. The overall experience was excellent and I am sure to return the next time I am in town.  Yes, the package was pricey but the haircut was standard price for this type of service. This is no Supercuts or Hair Salon--trust me on that.  If you are looking for that old style Barber experience with more than just a clipped head, please give Vs a try.  By the way, it is just behind Paradise Bakery in The Shops at Norterra.~~#~1
Awesome place!! EXCELLENT food/apps(try the bleu cheese figs)! Ask for Dizzy Dre, he's AWSOME and listens to your likes and customizes drinks for you!! Very patient with women!! ;)~~#~1
I got my nails done there last Thursday for the first and last time. I would never ever go back there. The man who did my nails burnt two of my fingers really bad. The place was dirty and messy and talk about noisy he asked me to many personal questions. To top it off he answered his cell phone and talked on it about 10mins all load and on speaker phone . So rude and bad customer service. It might be a little cheaper there but as the saying goes u get what u pay for!!!!!!!~~#~1
Do not bother going anywhere else. This is the place to go for laser. No contracts, easy to get appointments, very reasonable. The staff is fantastic, every one of them. I usually go to Kristen, but all others are as equally friendly and competent. Location is very convenient also. I have looked, and I have received many groupon and living social offers from other places, but I never bothered. This is the one.~~#~1
I realize L&L is a chain, but I love their food. My favorites are the Loco Moco and the BBQ Chicken. I also enjoy their haupia-filled donuts. The family that runs this place is very friendly and do a great job in making sure you will enjoy your meal. Go there.~~#~1
Huge portions of delicious pulled pork, perfect coleslaw, ice cold drinks, plenty of TVs, and friendly staff make this a fun place you should try!  Ohhhh yeah, be sure to use the Yelp check in deal for a free desert!  We went with the Death by Chocolate!  It is built for two and ohhh so delicious! However, I am only going with three stars due to limited BBQ meat selection compared to the others in town, limited cramped parking, and dirty paper menus.~~#~0
This is my favorite pho joint in all of Arizona. I have been to about 17 from flagstaff to mesa to central and Tucson! The owners are so welcoming and very proud of their business and it shows! The place is always clean and the bathrooms are immaculate! I always order pho Tai and water.. But I've had both their egg rolls and spring rolls both excellent! I love the broth! It's true pho broth.. It's not the beef bullion cubes other place use and you can defiantly taste the difference! The sprouts are the cleanest I have ever seen! I love this pho place ...  try the greatest pho in Arizona!~~#~1
I have been visiting Mrs. White's going on 30 years, but after looking up the phone number this afternoon to verify if they were open and still had fried chicken, my wife started reading some of the reviews following a recent Food Network recommendation - I almost got cold feet.Good thing I didn't. The food is as awesome as ever. The service is much as it has always been. Be forewarned, trendy restaurant goers, who glom onto TV reviews, Mrs. White's is not trendy; there are no bubbly fresh blonde girls waiting to seat you. The service is matter of fact, no goofing around, you must get to the business of ordering and pretend you know what you are doing - this is the way it has always been at Mrs. White's. If you are looking for others to pamper you, this is not the place for that. Mrs. White's is where you go to pamper your indulgence for perfect soul food. If you want Scottsdale ambiance, again, this joint won't work for you.When you go, be prepared that not all dishes may be on the menu during your visit. There are no corporate owned semi-trailers that deliver two tons of food every other day. This is a small and very cramped operation that makes homemade food for those who know how to appreciate it. In these days of flash frozen prepared dishes that are uniform from visit to visit at chain restaurants, this food is made in a tiny hot kitchen. If they run out of your favorite dish that has been cooking for hours prior to your arrival, there is no way they can whip up another pot of green beans and potatoes in 20 minutes. I often call ahead to verify if they have what I want because years ago it was not uncommon that by 12:30 they would be out of half of everything on the menu, which was OK because if forced me to try new things Back then, Mrs. White's was open Monday through Friday from 11:00 till 3:00, but I'd swear you'd be lucky to get anything after 1:00 - and that was perfectly fine as you knew they were doing all they could with their limited space to do their best for us customers. I'd just come back on another day. To say I have the utmost respect for the White family would be an understatement, today I was afraid I might have to lose that based on those poor reviews below. I do not believe those reviews are an accurate representation of The Golden Rule Cafe. They are the distortions and disappointments of people who have skewed expectations. Funky little hole-in-the-wall family-run operations that attract a loyal customer base may not be the place for everyone, but if you understand that wonderful stuff doesn't always come wrapped in a sterile designer package, then you might get along with Mrs. White's.I love this place and hope I always will.~~#~1
I've probably passed by this place a thousand times without ever stopping in before today. As others have pointed out, it's small and intimate, but I liked the charming atmosphere.I ordered the Seasoned Grilled Chicken on Cibatta and a Desert Blossom Iced Tea (lavender, hibiscus, apricot and rosehips). The sandwich was well balanced and moist. It was served with iceberg, roma tomatoes and a side of their house fries, "Kilo Fries." The fries were seasoned with a cheese blend, which seemed a little dry to me. However, a quick swirl in olive oil improved them quite a bit. The tea was delicate and refreshing - a nice complement to my lunch selection.The service is what stood out for me here. My server was friendly and attentive throughout the meal, even though I was dining solo. I certainly felt that my business was valued here. She even offered me a to-go cup for my tea, which was a nice touch.I will definitely be back to explore more of their menu. Prices are reasonable too, which doesn't hurt!~~#~0
I am DONE with Classic Car Spa, their sub-par car washes, and their shady business partnerships.  Whatever you do, DO NOT get your windshield replaced by the Auto Glass Shop that Classic Car Spa allows on their premises. I am holding Classic Car Spa accountable for placing their customers in such close proximity to criminals. While these Auto Glass Shop men are friendly and seem helpful, it is a scam. They replaced my windshield (and hey, it cost me nothing b/c my insurance covers it) and put the glass in wrong THREE TIMES! After one week and many HOURS on the phone with them and my insurance company, they are still giving me the run around. So although it was free, I will now have to foot the bill for fixing their crappy craftsmanship. After trying in vain to get my windshield fixed by the Auto Glass Shop, I spoke with the manager of Classic Car Spa. I don't think I've ever met a manager with a more relaxed, "who cares?" attitude. That place is a joke. Except, I'm not laughing....~~#~1
Don't waste your time...Arrowhead mall on the other side of town is so much better!~~#~1
I can overcome the hipster sneer and accept that I am an uncool blemish in a world full of cut-off corduroys and patterned leggings. What I cannot and will not get over is an unapologetic staff whose epic error led to me breaking 5 years of meatless eating because of an order mishap.I ordered the red pepper tomato quiche. After 20 minutes waiting for the quiche to warm in what appeared to be a 200 degree oven, I double checked to make sure my name was on the plate at the counter. When I dug in for the first bite, a wave of nausea and panic washed over my after realizing this was a piece of the bacon spinach quiche. I returned to the counter and explained that I had ordered the vegetarian quiche, and the chic who took my order asked the chic behind the counter which one she served, because she was sure she got it right. The chic in the kitchen said she put them out in the order she got them. Then they spent some time looking around in confusion and murmuring a bit,  meanwhile all the quiche had been sold. So the counter chic simply turned to me and send, "well we don't have anymore of that one."Thanks. I told her I was more upset about the fact that I had just put bacon in my mouth after 5 years of no meat than there being no more quiche. She did give me my money back, but no one apologized or offered me any recompense. I'm over you being cooler than me, but I'm not over you having no soul.~~#~1
Best happy hour on this side of town. The bartenders are very friendly and service is always prompt. I've never had a bad drink or a bad meal here. I only go in if Jennifer is working though! The bar has plenty of TVs too.~~#~1
I have been to Mabel's a few times now and I think it is a pretty stellar place. The food is awesome (try the chicken lollypops and the deviled eggs) and the drinks are strong. The ambiance is nice and cozy and I think it works well for a romantic dinner or a big group of friends. The staff has always been pleasant and accommodating and that goes a long way for me in Snottsdale. Last night I was wowed by Mabel's. We had a fundraiser for a great friend who has cancer and they not only let us throw it there FOR FREE, but generously offered to donate 20% of the bar tab to the cause. The service was great that night and they earned a fan for life. Thanks Mabel's, for being so cool, you're a breath of fresh air.~~#~1
Great place for Italian food. Very family friendly. Mellow atmosphere with friendly and knowledgeable staff. Never had a bad meal. My favorite is Sirloin Marsala and you can choose any pasta they have to go with it at no charge. Recommend to anyone who enjoys quality Italian for a good price.~~#~1
Hey Thai Elephant! Stop sucking! You used to be so good. Why is my egg roll cold? Why don't I get a fork with my food.... after asking!? Why won't you make me the Tiger on Fire for lunch when I got it last week for lunch?... AND it's on the menu! When did you decide to cut my curry portion in half almost? When did your service start sucking? Hey every person that decided that my two top was not important enough to attend! Why did it take 10 minutes to order my drink and then an additional ten minutes to actually get my drink? By the way, Tiger beer is on your menu. If you are not going to actually offer it, then you need to take it off your menu. I can't believe it's come to this... I used to love you. You broke my heart for the last time.~~#~1
I never write these things. But I have to say that you will not be disappointed with Paletas Betty. Especially with the weather right now, it is a delicious and healthy treat, made with seasonal ingredients. I highly recommend the limón amarillo when in season. Delicious frozen lemondade/lemon drop on a stick, tossed in a sugar rub. It is for certain served in heaven. That is all.P.S. check out the hours, yo. You know what's up.~~#~1
Could have been 4 stars... I went here for the first time last Friday. It was busy, but they don't have that many tables and there were at least 4 waitresses on that I could see. Our services was sooooooo slllllllow. Like painfully slow. We waited a long time for refills, a long time for our food, a long time for the check to come. It was really annoying. Our waitress was nice, but slow. Onto the food! We got an order of wings and an order of the fried zucchini. The zucchini was really good but holy hell she should have warned us that it had JUST came out of the fryer that may have been heated by lava. I popped one of those bad boys in my mouth and immediately felt the skin on the roof of my mouth start to come off. Once the burning subsided I was good to go. I hear the wings were tasty, They were really big (I just don't eat wings) I ordered the fish and chips. So yummy! Our friend got the grilled chicken sandwich with a side of grilled asparagus. LOVE that they offer grilled veggies as a side! I snuck a couple asparagus and they were tasty. Hubs got the ribs, it was a huge pile of meat on a plate. He loved it! I will for sure go back, the food was really great, I will just know not to expect quick service.~~#~0
I almost wish I hadn't discovered this place because it's so good! Ton's of flavors and every kind of topping you could want (even cake frosting) So much better than MoJo and to top it off the staff couldn't have been nicer.~~#~1
Gotta love Sweet Republic.... great philosophy and great icecream and sorbets. I've loved every single flavor I've had there (peanut butter, brownie swirl, mint chip, salted butter caramel, mayan chocolate, and more). Everything is made from all natural, fresh ingredients (virginia peanuts, fresh mint leaves, etc). When I really want to splurge I make my own sundae, you get to pick two flavors of icecream, a sauce, and a topping. If you haven't been to Sweet Republic, go! If you're far from Shea & 101, find them at First Fridays downtown, farmers markets, and more.~~#~1
I took my family here and this was a disappointin experience. The service was snobby and rude.  The waitress was condescending and the food was overprices. I have not been to the other Tomasos but I will clearly discourage anyone from dining at the Chandler Tomasos. The service is clearly substandard and snobby.~~#~1
Food was good. I had the Choppino Fruittas de Mare. Apparently the serving is large as the server hinted that it may be too large for me, but the serving was typical for a Fruits de Mare type plate that I've had at other restaurants. Sauce was nice: spicy and good flavor. Pasta was cooked well and the right portion size, I think people add too much pasta to make the dish look larger. Other than the imitation crab (a disappointment but not a deal breaker) the seafood was cooked nicely between the calamari, mussels, etc. Kid's spaghetti was very good. I taste all the kid's spaghetti since I have 3 kids and invariably someone doesn't finish or even start their bowl. The pasta was cooked well, the meatball was decent, but the sauce was shick and chunky (not watery which I hate) and covered all the pasta (which for some reason other restaurants can't seem to do). There isn't a specific kid's menu but the server said they make kid's portion size of anything on the menu but the price isn't available to be seen so you have to trust they aren't going to bend you over on those, which they didn't. Bread, of course, was available prior to meals. The butter used is very tasty, some type of garlic I think. Bread was warm, soft, and not overcooked.Now I would have given 4 stars except for a few exceptions: the decor and slower service. Decor was dreadful, sorry. Old and dated. I think their target demographics is 50 years old or greater as the chairs, pictures, and everything inside screams 1970's. The chairs remind me of an old conference hall. The lighting is on the dark side. I guess if I was out on a date or with 4 retired couples, it would be a nicer decor, but with 8 adults and 5 kids it just doesn't fit quite right.Kid friendly not quite, but kid accomidating is more like it. Since the ambience is darker and softer volume on conversations, having loud and obnoxious kids is not the right place for them.Overall, the food is good, servers friendly but not the family friendly place I usually prefer.~~#~0
False ads, do not stay there. Unless you don't mind a dirty, smelly, overrated hotel. The sheets and towels that were supposed to be white were gray. The place is run down and poorly serviced. The front lobby is clean but once you head up to your room you quickly find out that the place is run down and not being taken care of. I stayed on the fifth floor "cabana suites" and as soon as my elevator opened up on the fifth floor, I knew right away I stayed at the wrong place. The "suites" were nothing more than a room with a tiny bit of extra elbow space that are on the rooftop area with a pool in the front of the room. The pool was NASTY! (see pictures I uploaded) It was green and looked disgusting and when I arrived to take a look, it had an "out of order" sign placed at the entrance. This place was embarrassing! I had told my brothers to book there with me because we thought it was going to be a great hotel based on their website but we were very disappointed again!~~#~1
This was our first time at Texas BBQ House. They gave us a sample and help us with our order. The brisket was fantastic. I got the moist and my wife got the lean. We both enjoyed our choices immensely. I will definitely go back. I wanted some spicy BBQ sauce and apparently they have it but I didn't see it.~~#~1
As much as you don't want to like Wally World...it is what it is...crazy!!~~#~0
It's three stars because I don't know how to rate it -- I didn't think it was very good at all when I went the other night during their grand opening, but maybe I just don't have a taste for it.  Service was prompt and polite.  The food?  Eh.  I had one of the house specials.  I didn't think it was very special.  I do think the waiter deserves bonus points for talking me into a half order rather than a full order.  The lemon-lime beverage was strong and sweet.~~#~0
My husband and I have been here twice in the last week for dinner...it is a bit pricey as other reviewers have said (around $20 for dinner entrees), but for vegetarian and organic food, what exactly do folks expect?  You get what you pay for.  We were happily surprised after reading the reviews...the food was amazing, the portions are huge and we had leftovers both times.  (and p.s., we paid with a debit card both times and have had no trouble, despite the review about only paying cash.)Our first visit, we were greeted kindly and given a plate of fruit to munch on until we ordered.  My husband ordered the mint tea and it was delish!  For an appetizer, we had the sabzi...which is a huge plate of green herbs, homemade wheat nan, feta cheese, and walnuts.  The herbs were FRESH and the nan was delicious...just the smell of it was enough to get us drooling!For entrees, we had the spinach herb stew and the vegetable stew with eggplant.  I am currently pregnant and garlic is not something that's agreeing with me.  I asked if the vegetable stew had garlic in it and the waiter said "we can make it however you want...every dish is made when you order it"....what??  the dishes are made to order??  I haven't heard that at a lot of restaurants!  After about 20 minutes, our stews arrived...steaming hot and smelling delicious.  They were HEAVENLY!  So many flavors and so fresh!!Our second time here, we had the dolmeh plate and Mast Va Mosear (a spinach dip)...both were ok...but I like the Sabzi better.  The entrees we had were amazing...I had a special of the day (pomegranate walnut sauce over tofu, which was blissful to smell and eat) and hubby had the vegetarian sampler to get his falafel fix.Overall, if you are willing to pay a little more for a nice, organic foods dinner, go here and check it out.  Everything will be fresh...everything will smell and taste delicious...and the restaurant's atmosphere is perfect for a relaxed, decadent evening.~~#~1
My wife and friends went for lunch the the other day and liked it so I thought I'd give it a try.  Nice place, nice menu - good selections. I had the meatball hero lunch special.  Good meatball hero (meatballs with marinara + extra for cheese to make it meatball parm) - it was good; too big for lunch - I would have been satisfied with half with a handful of chips and a deli pickle spear or peperocini on the side vs. just the hero sitting on the plate solo (hope the owner reads Yelp!).I'll go back and try something else.  Good food, good location should do well.Who mounted all those nice TV's in there?  Shaquille O'Neal?  You get a neck ache looking up that high!PS - hey food runner, when you deliver a slice of pizza and it starts to slide off the plate don't use your bare hand to move the pizza - gross!  You know you saw me watch you do that too!~~#~0
No, I simply cannot put in a good review for Miracle Mile. A coworker recommended this place to me. Actually, two coworkers did.However, upon inspection of my pie right before I was about to eat it, I noticed that there was mold in it.Yes, mold.Sorry Miracle Mile, your fries were bland and while your chicken tenders were decent, I can't forgive mold in a pie. I did take a picture of it so I will be adding it to this review as soon as I can.Who knows if I will get my 2.95 for moldy pie back.*ETAMM has been notified and I am to receive a gift certificate for my 2.95. I was given the option of returning it but it's over a 40 min drive.~~#~1
I went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago with my bosses. It was packed on a Friday - we sat at the bar and our cook was fantastic! We got to sit and chat with him while he worked away at the orders. I had the chicken pesto pasty and it was wonderful! the bread used is similar to a pastry dough type...but not as sweet. The pasty was so filling, I could barely finish it.My bosses have been there before and have always wanted to try the peanut butter and jelly pasty - so we all split it as dessert and it was so good. They put bananas in it and drizzle jelly over the whole pasty. It's definitely rich and gooey. I would totally go back here again and have told my friends about it too! Amazing place.~~#~1
Since I work @ a casino, I'm always checking out the others...Plus, I like to gamble!! This place is nice, but seemed to be lacking personality. It's new, so it's very clean, w/all new machines. The few employees I dealt with, seemed extremely bored, and a drink girl was nowhere to be found. Because this place is new, and @ the edge of the Phx. area, they don't have to try very hard, and I think it shows.~~#~0
This is an adorable little gallery located in the middle of nowhere, Downtown Phoenix.  My art teacher friend got fixated on bringing me here when she heard me complaining about Phoenix being chain hell (and thanks to her and Yelp, I don't believe that anymore).  I think she chose wisely as I loved this little space.  It was a nice place to stop and check out, and then of course we had lunch at the attached City Bakery.  A perfect activity for a half-day of school!  Hooray creativity and uniqueness!~~#~1
Food poisoning alert. There is no doubt in my mind that this incident was caused by the order of potato skins I was served at this un-fine dining establishment. First off, the cook looks like somebody off the street, at least wear an apron buddy.    Now we are watching the games there and it's about 30 minutes after I eat 4 fairly large skins which I dipped in sour cream and the rumbling in the stomach started. Five minutes later, I was depositing those skins in their tiny toilet and trying to hold on while the games ended. Lastly, another stop was needed on way home to drop off some more skins. This place is full of local drunks, but a good watering hole (yeah literally). Go here to drink and stay away from all food. Also, it was 8 bucks for one order of skins. Why do places charge the same price for apps as they do for sandwiches. It's another sign of a clueless place with poor food and hygiene. Bad choice.~~#~1
Very very nice family owned bookstore that allows you to trade in your books and buy other books for half price. The owners have also recommended many books/authors to my family over the years.I came in today still seeking a book that I have gone to numerous libraries looking for. I found a copy on the shelf that was much bigger than an ordinary paperback. I asked if they might have any additional copies. The owner was so nice and went in the back room not once but twice to find me the book and it's sequel. I was so thrilled to have found the books!I believe that almost every year they have a book clearance where they sell off many books for only $1. I won't be in town for it but if anyone is, I recommend checking it out!~~#~1
OK, so this is how much I love this product. I first tasted Lee's at a Yelp Elite event and waited and dreamed a whole year to eat it again. When I was invited to the next year's Elite Pleydate it was the topic of the first question out of my mouth. "Is Lee's gonna be there?" ( Ok, maybe the whole French restaurant's Bone Marrow gravy came to mind too, but I digress) When I made it inside to Pleydate I literally ran to that booth having desert before dinner. I am all about the alcohol infused ice cream now. The funny thing about that is I am not even a big ice cream lover. I will have to visit the shop soon.~~#~1
If you are a big tea drinker like myself then you must check this place out! They offer a HUGE variety of loose teas from all around the world. They have herbal, rooibos, green, black, and white teas. The selection is phenomenal and there is some loose teas here for every type of tea drinker out there. They also offer high quality tea accessories that are beautiful like the teapots and tea mugs which are very classy and not overly expensive. Great place for those looking to pick up a unique gift for a tea lover or for the tea lovers like myself it is like stepping into tea HEAVEN. The owner is also very nice and offers good advice if you are looking for a particular taste or type of tea since there are at least 50-60 loose teas to choose from. Hear my teapot whistling......gotta go!~~#~1
I go to Regio's a lot; today I went and want to reiterate how great I think it is.  I have been going there for a couple years - have never been disappointed in anything I've ordered.  Their beans are delicious, as is their menudo (only on Saturday and Sunday, unfortunately), and eveything else: tacos, burritos, enchiladas, chile rellenos, etc, etc, etc. is great.  It is so inexpensive it's hard to believe.  Today my bff and I had 5 tacos and an order of beans (between us) and it was $10. HELLO! We had the mini-tacos, but we were stuffed and left there saying how wonderful it was and how full we were.  Check it out next time you're in the mood for some awesome, authentic Mexican food.  You will be glad you did.  Yummy.~~#~1
Every time I head to ABC cake supply I see this wonderful store on the way. I often say, "I need to stop there." Today I did. It is a wonderful ecclectic store filled with unique items. From baby, wedding, kitchen and on! I picked up some of their mini cupcake stands! LOVE!!!~~#~1
I only go here when my little cousin is in town and he adores this place. My cousin is 4 years old and obsessed with trains so he loves the small train display, the stationary trains you can walk through and the little train that goes around the park that you can ride on. A definite place to go with little kids especially if they like the trains.~~#~0
I moved in here a few ago and I do like it for the most part. The grounds are kept clean and tidy, except for some irresponsible pet owners. Some of them even let their pets run around leash-less or cannot control them. But that is not the management's issue.Pros:1. The apts are spacious, well-built.2. Grounds are clean and grass is maintained.3. Pool is well-maintained.4. Online system for rent pay and maintenance tickets is great.5. Price is great for the value.Cons:1. Apts not sound-proof or heat-proof.2. Sprinklers tend to sprinkle more water over the sidewalks than the grass area.3. Covered parking is extra $$$ and not enough of them anyways.4. Uncovered spots are all just crowded in the parking lot at the back.5. Security gates are open most of the time from the front and have gaps that could let an adult through on the sides.6. Outer compound Walls are not high enough to actually prevent/make it difficult for an intruder.7. Fitness center is adequate at best. Most of the free weights and equipment (except the machines) are broken or missing. The machines work ok, but are not maintained well.8. Leasing office employees could use a bit more smile and inter-personal skills.~~#~0
Not worth the money. Food was average and the portion was small for the price I paid.~~#~1
I love me some Dobson Ranch.  As far as municipals in the Valley are concerned, this is as good as it gets (Aguila is a close second).  No overbearing marshalls.  Rates that top out at $28 in the winter.  Above average range and practice area, including two large putting greens.  Cheap pitchers of beer.  A long-time cart lady who will spray your face with water in the summer!  As far as the course itself, this is not typical AZ golf - there are no cacti, only tree-lined fairways and some water sprinkled throughout to pose as threats.    But there are birdies to be had, and lots of them; #1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 13, 15 and 18 are the best chances in my experience (I consider this my home course).  The greens are usually pretty moderate speed to slow - this is grainy bermuda, not some hybrid or bent grass, so prepare to run the putts into the back of the hole.  #5 is my favorite hole, a short-par 5 that gives you the chance to hit over a tree left and drive the narrow fairway, leaving you a long to mid-iron into an elevated green that slopes toward you.  #8 is a formidable challenge if you have the tendency to block (or slice, as may be the case) the ball from time-to-time, as your ball will face a watery grave.  #16 is a tricky tree-lined hole with a tight driving area and doglegs right.  And finally, #18, a short par 5 that is easily reachable and where a par feels like a bogey.  A scant 6600 yds from the blue tees (but rarely plays it's full length), there are some low scores out there.A great course, value, practice area, and recently renovated restaurant and bar - 5 stars.~~#~1
Mouth watering. That's all I have to say.The food at this place is seriously amazing. Everything we tasted was better than the dish before it, and we had a fabulous bottle of white wine to accompany our meal. The scallops were a highlight, as was the potato pie dish (that's not a very technical name for what it was, but that's my best effort). It was all very, very good, and the only thing keeping us from returning is the cost! We genuinely enjoyed our evening here, and we will absolutely go back, but it is pricey, especially for the size of the dishes.The atmosphere and ambiance are so fun, and this place is a little dressier and trendier than some other places we've been in Scottsdale. I highly recommend this for a night out with friends, or a cool date night. It seemed as though reservations would be a good idea, although we didn't have them and were okay (it was busy, though).~~#~1
IKEA is so much fun. It's a little bit of a walk up and down the store but with all the different items on display there is time to sit and relax on the chairs, couches, beds. I love walking around the store looking a new ideas for my own home. They have very good prices on all household items. When shopping for accessories for the house I highly recommend going to IKEA because you are bound to find something. Simple things such as Tupperware, trash cans, bathroom accessories can all be found at a really good price.~~#~1
Great for Saints and LSU games.~~#~0
Came for dinner with a friend with the $2 off coupon. The service was attentive, friendly, and overall excellent. The english conversation is less than stellar but the fact they took off $2 from both of our meals more than makes up for it. Still a little pricey for two gals with small appetites but not bad. Pani poori, naan, mango lassi, hot chai tea, tikka masala, paneer makani, lamb curry, and many other options available. I would avoid the gross spaghetti noodle option and awkward as it sounds mango flavored other fruit custard.  Overall a good experience. My favorite part is that the separators still have bears from when it was a black bear diner!~~#~0
This review is for Gil's catering - which is fantastic.  Our perfect event for a new product launch needed to be casual, but tasty and high quality.  Gil's was all of these things.  The food presentation is pretty without pretension.  Everything was fantastic.  Best of all, Gil worked with us to plan an event within our budget.  Fare is traditional with a tasty twist - our group loved the chimis, taquitos, enchiladas and especially the chips.  We expected 2 servers and 4 showed up - including Gil.  They over delivered in every sense.~~#~1
Enjoyed the egg rolls.  So glad that they were made out of fried rice paper because I have food allergies.  The entree of BBQ beef with rice noodles was also very good.  I will be going back this weekend with the hubby for sure.  Very clean and nicely decorated restaurant.  Very nice waitress. The restaurant smelled really good too: spices maybe?  A bit warmer than I would like inside.  Maybe they need to turn up the A/C.~~#~1
My wife and I celebrated our anniversary here for the first time. I have nothing but good things to say. Food, wait staff and overall experience were excellent. This is an old school type of steakhouse with red velvet wallpaper, leather booths, etc. If you haven't been, I can't recommend it highly enough. Give it a try and you'll be glad you did!~~#~1
I live in downtown Phoenix; Boyfriend lives in Tempe. After two years of getting our date on at places like Postino's, St. Francis, the Rokerij, Dick's Hideaway, and Padre's, we decided we needed a Tempe date place. Friday night we decided to check out La Bocca.In short. it's okay. Nice environment, good service, pretty good pizza, and great ice cream flight for dessert. But this is tempered with over priced wine (almost $20 for two glasses of HOUSE wine?), small pieces of bruschetta (tasty - scratch that - REALLY tasty, but the slices are teeny tiny), and it's on Mill, so most of the other patrons are frat guys trying to impress sorority sisters, and if you're lucky, you'll get to see a couple of Greeks making out. Yum? There was a table of older people tucked into a corner who didn't seem to mind the age gap, but in my late-20s, I was not very much amused.The good service, cool atmosphere, tasty bruschetta choices, and creative, thin crust pizza get this place three stars. The over priced wine and bruschetta (seriously, we usually get bruschetta at Postino's for the same price for 4 people, and then I am too full to order dinner, but at La Bocca I was ready for round two after my half of the plate), and the fact that it's on Mill keeps it from 5 stars. We both really wanted to like this place, but I think next time we want to get dressed up and go out on the East side, we'll try somewhere else. In the meantime, we'll stick to downtown.~~#~0
We came here the weekend of the Grand Opening. I will say we were very impressed and  there was so much to choose from at this new and improved Pets Mart.  There is a Hotel here for Cats and Dogs. There is a Banner Pet hospital, and there is a Grooming station ,as well as a Dog training store as well. Talk about your one stop shopping. I even got to hold a beautiful baby girl Pug just 6 weeks old. She was absolutly adorable.   We took a picture but have not figured out how to download it yet. Nice and Clean all throughout the store . We purchased a few items and then we were on our way.  Lots of Parking in the lot. Plus nice clean human bathrooms.~~#~1
A great family owned restaurant! Their lunch specials are very reasonable. I recommend this place to anyone looking for good Japanese food. My only request is that they open a restaurant closer to Tempe - I would go so much more often.~~#~1
Glad this place has new ownership... I should probably remove the review below, Its really harsh and doesn't apply to the NEW establishment.  You have been warned ;) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Short Review:THIS PLACE SUCKS BALLSLong Review:We were supposed to meet a friend here at Draft House on Saturday night. We were excited to be out on a date-like experience cuz its been a while. We went to my in-laws for dinner and then headed to Draft... I knew it was going to be interesting from the sound of the music as we pulled into the strip mall. The music: Good music, probably the only good thing about this place - if you're a hip-hop fan. All hip-hop, all night. The crowd: Ghetto fab all the way! Seems like everyone there is late 20's - early 30's (and some older sprinkled throughout the crowd) and none realize its not 1996 anymore. Expect to hear a lot of fake accents a la Da Bronx and a lot of misuse of slang terms. It was entertaining until it became annoying. Oh and people WILL steal your seats or tell you they are saved - ugh!The atmosphere: small, crowded...  Small dance floor.  A couple pool tables, but don't expect to get one. Some TVs playing various sports, which I guess qualifies this place as a "sports cafe"?? The service: OMG, we had one beer each and the "line" was retarded, over 30 minutes to tab out. No line in sight, just people crowding together, trying to get to the front of the line.  Oh! and LOL.. the bar tenders are total morons, one of them complained to the guy next to us about his crappy tip and the other argued with his customer about whether they ordered rum and cokes or redbull and vodka.  The guy had already made the rum and cokes and was pissed that HE got it wrong.  Weirdos!If any of this appeals to you this is your place! BTW her friend didn't show and we ended up going to Skip n Jan's to play some pool :o)  We had a great time there :o)~~#~1
My work got some Christmas allowance and instead of doing a dinner we decided to get a really nice lunch for our branch. We decided on Oregano's cause it was on the way. I had the stuffed Italian sandwich and it blew my mind. I couldn't believe how bug this sandwich was, it provided me with two wonderful lunches. It looks like some of my coworkers got the sausage sandwich and the steak sandwich and one person got a pasta dish and couldn't even eat a quarter of it because they gave so much. After that experience I am going to make more of an effort to get to the restaurant instead of getting it to go.~~#~1
Do to have that ONE review you just keep putting off and dont care to write it? Thats the post office for me. You get what you get, and you get it here. It's like a review of a place that no matter what any of us write, it'll never change. One thing I'd LOVE to see, especially once the Snow Birds return... A speed line. Just a basic line for basic transactions. I always use the automatic machines as often as I can, but it always seems the times I have to wait in line, it's always out the door and takes forever. Stick to mornings and late afternoons. Skip on weekends!~~#~0
I will precede this lackluster review by stating the following:1)I have only been to this place once.2)I didn't get a chance to actually try the cuisine.3)I am a sympathetic person to servers, as I have been one.That being said, I give this place one star for reasons of poor service.About six months ago, at around 4pm on a Sunday afternoon, we decided to eat at this place. The atmosphere was warm and cozy; typical college bar with college-aged waitresses.We made sandwich selections and ordered happy hour beers. The beers came, the food never did, and we watched other patrons come in, eat, and leave.  All the while, our waitress never came by to give us an explanation or even get us another round of drinks (we got them ourselves from the bar). Since my bf and I both worked in food service, we are always sympathetic when we can see that a place is under-staffed.  But after an hour of waiting, we finally crossed the room to speak with our server. She said, "I can't imagine it will be much longer." I think the more professional approach would have been an apology and admitting to forgetting to put in our ticket, which is what we gathered when we saw her speaking frantically with the cook.Where was the manager that day? Or someone who noticed that we sat there so long without our food or any communication at all?We left money on the table for our beers and walked out. I guess there is a first time for everything.~~#~1
As I passed the velvet rope flanked by shiny, exotic cars I knew I was in for an experience.  Some might call it a fine-dining experience, but clearly this was something more.  A tribute to opulence and Regan-era excess, Dominick's is your seven-figure foodie fantasy come alive; from the moment you enter the swanky foyer to the gleaming 10 inch tower of tiramisu that finishes your meal.  It's glittery, bedazzled, and oozing pretension - and I loved it.The ServiceMy visit to Dominick's was the night after it's official opening.  The service tried very hard to be as impeccable as the surroundings and, while not perfect, the charming staff and the sincere effort put forth made little things like missing napkins and bread plates instantly forgivable.  Our server, Drew, let us know that the wait staff only had 2 - 3 tables each and it was very evident in the personal service we received.  A few more weeks of experience for the staff should easily iron out the little wrinkles.The FoodWe started with the jumbo shrimp appetizer, which unfortunately came with 3 shrimp - hardly conducive to sharing - so we ordered two. And "Jumbo" they certainly were, accompanied by a kicky cocktail sauce which my dinner companion felt was spicy enough.  Ever the daredevil, I added additional horseradish to mine because who doesn't like to burn the inside of their nostrils at dinner.For the main course we both had the 9-oz filet, lobster gnocchi and steamed asparagus.  My filet was a perfect rare-plus with a dark pink center, expertly seared and juicy.Surprisingly the lobster gnocchi really stole the show for me.  I'm not big on starches or cream sauces so when it was suggested I wasn't particularly excited; I should have been.  The dough was light and fluffy, the cream sauce not too rich and the lobster added the perfect amount of salt & texture.After dinner I indulged in a grand marnier while my companion ordered the tiramisu.  He was presented with a 10 inch tall hunk of cake that could easily have been intended for 4 people.  The tiramisu was spongy and light, with a lovely cool custard and only a subtle flavor of rum.  A nice finish to an excellent meal.  AtmosphereWe were lucky enough to score a poolside table which started off as very romantic but over the course of the evening became quite the place for people watching.  The scene at the small bar area on the 2nd floor was bustling and both the waiters and I wondered aloud how long it would be before a guest fell in the pool.  I bet they didn't make it through the weekend without someone making a splash.~~#~1
I Love this place. I eat here either take in or take out at least 2 times a week!I also agree with some of the others. I love the fact that I can try something new without committing! I love the revolving sushi. I also do not like that there are a lot of spicy selections. Why not offer the spice on the side. I would love some of the sushi, but it has that spicy sauce on it.Some of the best to offer that some people might not know about:Haru sushi - Tuna stuffed with crab and topped with avocado!Hand rolls - YUM!!! Some are only 2.50Udon - Good!The staff is great. The wait can be long on some days or eves.Love the baked scallops. Great mussels too.~~#~1
Very nice neighborhood spot.  The mussels are great and both pork dishes we tried were outstanding.  The Bacon-Cheddar biscuits make the meal and Fig pecan pie is the perfect finish.~~#~1
I had a tough time deciding between 4 and 5 stars.  Wish there was 4.5 stars available for me to choose.Went here on a business trip with a coworker and tried it out. I had at least one of the following:Sapporo - Can it ever be bad?  It was served very cold.  Thumbs up.Green Tea - Good.  Good service on the refills also.Edamame - Good.  Right amount of salt.Miso - Interesting wooden bowl and wooden spoon.  It tasted good, tho.Yellow Tail, Salmon, Tuna, Albacore, Uni, FW Eel,  Kampachi nigiri.  Good stuff on all of those.  They also have "Yasu style" nigiri for some types, and they are good.  It usually involves ponzu on top.Spicy Tuna and Softshell Crab roll.  SSC was great!Service was pretty good and sushi was also good.  The bar was full but I wish I could have eaten there.  The sushi chefs were friendly and talkative to the people at the bar, which is unusual (at least compared to LA).  The base quality of the fish, outside of whatever ponzu, soy, wasabi and other ingredients were on it, was pretty good, but I wouldn't say 5 stars.  Since I generally judge a place wholly on the food, I give it 4.5.  Failing that, I rounded up!~~#~1
I love this place.  The first time I went, I had my mom and my sister with me.  We all got pedicures and by far the best foot massages I've had at any of these nail places.  The thing that really impresses me the most is that after only one visit... the next time I came in- they greeted me by my name. How often does that happen?  Hello, customer service- welcome back.  It's husband and wife owned and operated and they are as nice as can be. Love it here.  Great atmosphere, friendly, good service, affordable.  You won't be disappointed.~~#~1
Mid-priced dining with high end flavor. I ordered the special Yelp menu. Started off with mixed green salad with fig dressing. Very good. Moved on the the "smart" chicken. Tender, char grilled breast with corn risotto. Yum!  Topped it off with a perfect chocolate de creme. Staff was friendly and very on top of things. Great experience.  I'm definitely coming back. give these guys some love!~~#~1
Still loving Sunflower after a year and a half.  I actually moved houses to be closer to this grocery store.  The staff have never complained about going an extra mile, the prices have stayed better than any store I've been to lately and they have been having great beer specials.Special note:  They have a large selection of homeopathic and environmentally sound products for your everyday corporal adjustments.  Tons of specialty soaps, herbal supplements and vitamins.  Check for the solution here before going to chain pharmacies!~~#~1
Ace and fried mushrooms at Casey's. My version of heaven. The food is good and the beer is even better, but what people really go for is the ambiance. The most awesome potpourri of people. Old, young, but always interesting.Say hi to Thomas the cat for me! He's chilling with the patrons when ever it's not too crowded.~~#~1
Cave Creek is a well-manicured muni, featuring a straight-forward layout, nice practice area and large putting green.  There are some elevation changes and some bunkering that add some challenge, but overall it's a pretty easy course.Some of the better holes are #5, a dogleg right with no room to drive it left (slopes into a hazard), and large green with some tricky pin positions if the flag is in the back.  #8 is a long par four with a narrow driving area and a challenging approach featuring a narrow chute to the green that will most likely need to be hit with a mid-to-long iron (#1 handicap).  #11 is a par 5 that forces you consider fairway metal off the tee, as a driver hit over 260 yds and to the right could likely find a water hazard, and anything left is completely dead.  My personal favorite hole is #18, a short four par with a carry over a ravine from the tee to an uphill, dogleg left fairway with a slope on the left side and a reachable fairway bunker.  Most of the greens here are fairly large, so lag putting will come into play.  There aren't any tricks here - it can suit fairway-green style and the bomb-and-gouge crowd.  The driving range desperately needs new balls, but the course is a solid three stars.~~#~0
Top notch cheesesteak. One of the best in the valley. This place has a large delivery area, and is located right by campus. The owners are really nice and friendly. I'm really glad something moved into this spot. It's so convenient. Their desserts are great as well. I wish they had some chicken options, but they are new and said they would be adding to the menu as time goes on. My girlfriend said the turkey sandwich was fantastic. They sometimes carry Tasty Kake, so ask about that. I've had the authentic cheesesteaks from Philly, and this tastes every bit as good if not better. It's definitely in my top 5 local cheesesteaks.Edit: Just ordered delivery - Lightning fast! This place is incredibly legit. I went with a cheesesteak with White American cheese instead of "wiz" this time - So incredibly good. They tossed in a new dessert they didn't have last time which was awesome. Their prices are really good and their food is so delicious. I'm a huge fan. I'm not kidding with this 5 star rating - I love this place. Rave rave rave...~~#~1
The Westin Kierland is a beautiful resort located in PHOENIX, not Scottsdale. Some close friends of mine from Canada stayed in this PHOENIX resort for a few days, so I've hung out in its rooms and generally lounged about the property. The rooms were impressive, beautifully decorated, and spacious. We especially enjoyed taking the kids out to small fire pits maintained on the grounds, where guests to our fine city of PHOENIX can roast marshmallows. The Kierland has some tough competition, considering that the city of PHOENIX has every one of the most famous resorts in the Valley, from the Biltmore, to the Phoenician to the Royal Palms. It does pretty well in a tough line-up. No offense to Scottsdale, which also has some great resorts such as the Four Seasons. It's just that the most famous ones are in PHOENIX.[For further information, please visit: http://phoenix.gov/BNDMAPS/index.html]~~#~1
Sprouts is my favorite market to shop at! They are a great company who have a very friendly staff in their stores as well as their corporate office. They are also very involved with the community and with local farmers and businesses!The prices for all the fresh and natural groceries they carry are the most reasonable out of all the grocery stores I have been too! The Vitamin Department has everything you could ever look for to help your well being and they are always extravaganzas in the stores so you are always getting the most out of your money, and in times like these I know people are very appreciative of that since groceries are becoming more and more expensive everyday, or so it seems!I most definitely recommend anyone to shop at Sprouts!~~#~1
Went to Fatburger with our family tonight and will not return. Average food. The burgers were average. The lettuce was wilted, the tomato was green, and nothing outstanding about the flavor. I'd say better options nearby are Joe's farm grill, In-n-out, or Culvers. Cleanliness was average. The floor was a little sticky and the beverage area was kept very neat. The kitchen appeared clean. Service was below average/horrible. The cashier was very unpleasant. We all ordered at the same time and the first half of the food came out about 15 minutes prior to the 2nd part. It was pretty slow. By the time we got the fries they were cold. The staff literally acted like they were a bunch of highschoolers who were annoyed that there were any customers who interrupted their hangout. I know this sounds harsh...it is. My experience was absolutely horrible. We will not be back and I don't recommend that you should either.~~#~1
I love this place.  Great food, great service from some of the nicest staff, and just a fun place to go.  It is also a place I like to meet people for happy hour.  They have a wonderful selection of beers, fantastic wines, and I have never once had anything but great food while eating there.~~#~1
I had the pleasure of living across the street from this treasure for about 6 years. I'm still lucky enough to work close by.   Let me be clear. I 'm reviewing Haji Baba as a GROCERY STORE first.  Then I will give you some insight into the prepared food for take-out or in-store dining.This is one of the few stores in Arizona where you have several choices for pita bread--it's also the ONLY place I've found for whole wheat pita.There are several choices for Feta cheese. Danish, French,Greek...same with olives--there are choices.I ALWAYS buy my tahini here. All the prices are very inexpensive.Need spices???  They have them all.  At about 25% of the price you would pay anywhere else.The best way to describe Haji Baba is that it is a REAL grocery store, with REAL prices, for REAL people.  It is NOT a "specialty store" with trendy items and inflated prices.  They sell food items that you will actually use.  The bonus here?  You won't find a 10 year old can or jar of something.On to the "restaurant" portion.  Haji Baba is better if you think of it as a take-out joint that happens to have places to sit and eat.  They do have tables and they do perform table service, it's just got zero charm.  You go for the food, that's it.Okay, food.  The lamb tongue sandwich is to die for.  Let me repeat.  The LAMB TONGUE PITA SANDWICH.  GET IT!  Their baba ganouj is also darned tootin' tasty.  Actually, I sometimes dream about their baba ganouj.I'm not crazy about their hummus, maybe because making hummus takes 5 minutes and mine is bomb? But it's not bad.Gyros are good and not greasy. Greasy gyro meat is a pet peeve of mine.Chicken shwarma?  Yup, that's good too.I'm sure I've had something  to eat  here that I was a little disappointed in, but I honestly can't remember what, or when.~~#~1
I was looking into gyms around the area. Upon entering I was greeted by the front desk guy. I asked about memberships and then he said, "Sorry we are sold out". I stood there stunned. Then he snickered, "Just kidding". Trying to be a good sport I went with it. Next came the young sales guy. He was personable - at first anyways. Showed me around the gym and I was interested in joining. Next we went over to the childcare area since I have a little one. Children were in the room however the two girls monitoring the room were chatting it up with one another and ignoring the kids. Bad sign. I asked the girls if they were CPR certified and had fingerprinting and background checks. The world stopped for just a moment and they stared at me. I had interrupted their important conversation. Then they were both saying, "Yeah, like, well, um, no, I mean yes,". In other words, no straight answers. We sat at the sales guy's desk and the wheeling and dealing began. I felt like I was purchasing a new car. "If you choose option A, you then can go to all the gyms." "If you choose option B, then only here" . The whole time I could see the children's area and the kids were being completely ignored (and we are talking very little children). When I told the sales man I needed to think about it he switched into some type of Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde routine. "Well you only have today to make a decision, after that no price guarantee!!!"   From there he was down right rude.I walked out of there thinking what the heck just happened. Like Sarah G, I felt horrible when I left this gym.  It was an awful experience. Ended up getting a membership at Tangible Fitness on 7th Street. They don't have the same amenities however it is locally owned, and the people are very nice there.~~#~1
Great and has been for years.  Lines out the doors at lunch but worth the wait.  I recommend combo 'K'This place is the where you should take someone from out of town that wants the best mexican food.~~#~1
Another great Italian find!My BF and I went to Roma Garden for dinner last night because he was given a gift certificate there from a friend.  We'd never heard of it, but we're always up for trying something new, especially with $50 towards our meal.  We pulled up to their strip mall location without expectations and we were both pleasantly surprised!When you walk in, the lighting and decor are welcoming and the staff is friendly and attentive.  It was a Thursday night and there were plenty of other guests in the restaurant, and there was a lively energy in the air.  After browsing the menu, I ordered one of the few 'Chef's Specials' of the night - tilapia with fresh veggies and pasta in a lemon caper sauce.  BF went with Pollo Parmagiana.  He had a glass of cabernet and I had pinot grigio... and voila - a warm bread basket arrived on our table at just the right time!We were both happy with our orders when they arrived as well... the fish was cooked just right and the sauce was tasty... good portions as well!  Although we were full, we decided to order a dessert to share - the homemade snow white chocolate tartufo - yum!  The perfect sweet ending to our meal.  In addition, we were each brought an after dinner drink of amaretto on the rocks, on the house.****I just have to share that I was pleasantly surprised that the women's restroom was clean, spacious, and had a fresh fragrance to it - I normally don't notice that, but I was impressed by this!In speaking to the waiter and the owner, we learned that this restaurant recently changed locations but they've been in business for over 15 years.  Gotta love the local businesses that last in the valley... we'll be back to support Roma Garden and enjoy their fine "Northern Italian Cuisine" without a doubt.  I suggest you go check it out also - bon appetito!~~#~1
Love this place...can't beat it for a healthy meal. Tons of good options that are tasty without all the cheese.~~#~1
Agree with those who describe this place as enchanting.  The rooms are extremely comfortable, the grounds are picture perfect and the pools are very pretty.  We had 8 people in our group ages 15-64 and everyone found something they loved about this place.~~#~1
I was sent to Amomi spa from my OBGYN for my  first pregnancy to get all of my ultrasounds.  I felt very at ease the first time I walked in because of the very clean place and friendly staff. Every ultrasound technician I have had has been really great and knowledgable.  I really like that they have high tech equipment with big plasma tv's on the wall so I could see a big,clear picture of the baby. Also, the  large spacious rooms are really nice. On a side note, they have great products to buy in the lobby.Now pregnant with my 2nd baby, my OB referred me to 2 different places this time for my ultrasounds. Without hesitation I knew I wanted to go back to Amomi spa again to get all of my ultrasounds. I have already been twice this time around and looking forward to going again in a few weeks.~~#~1
We had a GREAT dinner there on Saturday.  We were celebrating my aunt's birthday, and we ordered from the regular and special menus.  I had a truly wonderful chicken Madiera, my hubby had meat loaf, which is always a "tell" for a good place, my uncle had fried haddock which was crunchy and not at all greasy, and my aunt also had the chicken Madiera, which was fork-tender.  We also had great service - attentive without being too much, and we completely enjoyed our meal.  We will definitely visit this location again.~~#~1
Wow, what a busy place. We came here while visiting Scottsdale. We are always up for a good breakfast and it seemed that this was the appropriate restaurant to try. This place reminded us a bit of a great small pancake house in Anaheim, CA called the Original Pancake House. It is much bigger and modern, so it lacks charm, but the food is better than standard faire. With that said, the creativity is good in their menu selection, but poorly executed. I had the banana french toast and was a bit disappointed. The banana bread used was fine, but too dense for french toast. It hardly had any egg coating to truly classify it as french toast. They serve huge slices of raisin toast, but bigger is not necessarily better. Very dry and not flavorful. Eggs were fine, and the service was good. I would come here before going to IHOP, but I would seek a different small hole in the wall breakfast joint before rushing back here. Avoid the Sunday brunch hour patrons, unless you're prepared to wait an hour or so. Enjoy.~~#~0
Pho-yuck this place! I was tricked in to going here with promises of great Vietnamese. I was ready for a culinary adventure and what I got was a ride in the fright house. The Bánh xèo was so greasy I couldn't eat it, it was literally served on a plate of grease. The bun was about the same. It lacked flavor, the rice noodles were slimy, the spring roll was loaded with grease. I ordered some sort of plum soda drink and it had a cup of salt on the bottom of the glass.The service was horrible and I will not be back.~~#~1
Shaved noodles, shaved noodles, shaved noodles!  Am I too butt lazy if I only go for shaved noodles?  The dish ordered with the handpulled meant I had to hold chopsticks high into the air trying to separate a portion of noodles out onto our plates.  Not bad but wasn't special... but the shaved noodles, loved the chewy texture.  I unashamedly used my baby godson as an excuse to get a mini noodle pulling show at the window.I'm going to work my way thru the fresh fruit juice offerings...  I used to drink that daily while working as an expat in HK.  Speaking of which, the bathrooms are sooooo HK grand (Amy L, you and I think alike!)...Overall the stir fried dishes were a bit greasy and the flavors decent, but the draw here is the shaved noodles (can I plug this anymore?!) and the fresh fruit juice.~~#~0
Meaty, beaty, big and bouncy!Add "beefy" and you've pretty much summed up your 5GB&F  experience!After detoxing this morning, I was really hungry...after all, I'm a pretty big and bouncy boy and when you lug this kind of tonnage up and down the canal, you're going to need some retoxing!And since it's Taco Tuesday, I thought a burger fest sounded about right!I needed to be up north anyway, so I texted my order (what a time and vexation saver that is!...two stars for 5GB&F right there) and it was ready, hot and juicy when I rolled in.The burgers and fries remind me of nothing so much as Wendy's of about 30 years ago...you know, when Wendy's was actually pretty good (not like now when, they consistently screw up your order and figuratively, literally throw your bag-o-food into your car as you idle by the pickup window).The burgers are OK, the fries are fresh and peanutty (no, really...fresh peanut oil...the fries taste peanutty!), and the Coke is, well, Cokey. The atmosphere is nice enough, all red and white checked and tons of "look at me" crap on the walls ("Best Fries in Hoboken!")The music was also reasonably pleasant (Men at Work..."I come from a land down under"...I shuddered a little bit at the part "and men chunder"...please, no chundering while I'm eating!).Anyway...I was able to purchase this little repast for a mere $11.83 (I saved a little by having the small fries).I know, Grind or Delux prices for a retro Wendy's burger!I'm no spendthrift, but I could feed a family of 6 at In-n-Out for $12...and with better burgers.But, 5GB&F filled me up, they had my burger ready to roll and they very nicely didn't mess up my order (but then again, how could they screw it up...they were ordered to prepare my burger by a computer...we know what happens when you don't do what a computer tells you...you "accidentally" ride over a cliff on your Segway, that's what happens!) And, in a nostalgic sort of way, they reminded me of how Wendy's used to be (complete with 70's music), and for that, a reasonable 3.25 stars.~~#~0
we celebrated my birthday all weekend.  we made the trek to bobby q on sunday. I ordered the brisket sandwich with mac and cheese and let me tell you about that mac & cheese..it was amazing. Mr H went with the chicken and brisket and for his sides: beans and potato salad.  The food is sinfully delicious! I will NOT be coming here as often as I would like... I found it too indulgent. it is definitely a treat and worth trying! I love those little donuts they give you at the end!~~#~1
I'd been hearing about Defalco's for a while now. My husband, Jim W, and my youngest, Abby, raved. "Best steak grinda since Baston," they said. So, on an expedition to get more raw chocolate, we went.The first thing I noticed was that the tables were scattered among the racks of Italian foodstuffs. I loved that. The place screamed "Boston" from the moment we walked in the door. When we ordered, Jim found one of my favorite types of soda in the case, Doc Brown's diet black cherry. I was in heaven.So we got our number and sat down. While we were waiting - a short wait - I got a brilliant idea which solved a long-vexing problem. Guess it was the east coast vibe.The food came and I was in heaven. We split a steak sandwich and red potato salad. Jim likes everything and I just like onions so they gave him the mushrooms and peppers on the side. Lots of mushrooms and peppers. It didn't look like a ton of food but we certainly got enough to eat.What's not to like at Defalco's? The food is fabulous, the prices are good, the people are really nice, and they have all kinds of imported goodies. So I guess the only thing I didn't like about Defalco's was leaving.~~#~1
Incredibly good calzones; friendly service, nice courtyard seating.~~#~1
Nic-nacs galore!~~#~1
After talking to a number of bartenders in the area -- and doing some fairly extensive personal research -- I feel pretty comfortable saying that if you want the best cocktails in the Phoenix area, you should head to the Jade Bar at the Sanctuary Resort.  This is off the beaten path a bit, and after a few miles down streets with no street lights, it felt a bit like driving to a ski lodge up in the mountains.  It's worth the drive though.  I had two excellent cocktails ("The Last Word" and a "Pendemums Club"), and one enjoyable and informative conversation with Jillian the bartender.  Wish I could have made some of their mixology classes.~~#~1
What's not to like?  Stingray does stylish sushi and happy hours just fine.  This is the only "chainy" sushi place that I will eat at.  I can't stand sushi at Kona or, god forbid Ra.  I have always found the sushi to be fresh tasting, especially the salmon skin roll, which for some reason, is absent in a lot of establishments.  One of my other favorites is the summertime roll, it's tuna and avocado delicately wrapped in soy paper which I love.  They also do a very adequate and lively happy hour where house drinks are half priced, and there is a nice variety of sushi rolls and apps that are between $3-$8, oh and sake bombers too! We went specifically for the fact that their happy hour lasts until 7pm, and they have a great patio.  We have always received attentive service, and when sitting at the sushi bar, you receive complimentary edamame and miso soup (although their version is kind of salty and not my favorite).  Friday the BF and I had 4 drinks, fried calamari, gyoza, 2 sushi rolls and salmon nigiri for $40.  Not bad, not bad at all.  The Biltmore location is where you will find me.~~#~0
omg...hands down the worst chinese food I've ever had anywhere.  Stopped by for lunch with my wife.  I ordered their cashew chicken dish and my wife ordered the pad thai noodles with shrimp.  Barely edible.  Makes Panda Express look like gourmet chinese food.  Prior to Flo's, the distinction of the worst chinese food went to a chinese restaurant in Nebraska...but that's Nebraska.  I'm chinese and live in San Francisco so know a thing or two about good chinese food.~~#~1
Hit or miss. Pretty much the perfect definition of the "HoHo". My friend and I like to come before shows and for happy hour (super cheap draft beers and wells), the well drinks are usually a little weak but being so cheap I can't blame them.Tuesday's are taco day and they have some pretty decent deals. Each day of the week has a "special" as far as food goes, it's average to below average bar food.There are some games and shuffleboard as mentioned in previous reviews. TVs scattered all along the sitting area and a sizeable patio for the smokers.The bartenders are the real hit or miss part of the experience. I've been here and had great service, I've returned to have sub-par service (it wasn't very busy).All in all, if you're looking for a place to grab some cheap beers (we're talking domestics on tap) before heading into The Clubhouse or heading to somewhere else to spend the night, stop in and check it out at least once.~~#~0
What an amazing Mini Vacation.  I went in August which was about 105 degrees but it was perfect.  The pool was relaxing, the water felt great and I enjoyed all three nights of my stay.  We decided it was so great we never left the resort.  The Room was very clean and very comfortable.  Talavera had the most amazing Fish Entrees, the seabase OMG I can still taste it, the salmon was the best I have ever had, and I dislike salmon completely.  The service through out the restaurant and hotel was amazing.  The special drinks they had were very tasty and made the 105 degrees weather manageable.  The brunch buffet and breakfast at Crescent Moon is excellent all three days, so fresh, the pomegranate fresh juice was amazing I had three.  The food tasted like the items were freshly picked that morning.  I literally gained 5 ILBs on this trip and it was worth all of it.  The Lounge had tasty small Tapas which I enjoyed while it drizzled that night, the whole hotel has a great relaxing ambiance.The nights were amazing to walk around the hotel or sit around the pool with the night lights on and enjoy the peacefulness of the resort.  I believe we saw bats flying around in the middle of the night. which was very cool.  Worth every penny.  Just watch out for Camera Speed Traps on the way there.  Enjoy,~~#~1
Delicious barbecue, we had 4 meats platter that we split with three people.  The pulled chicken is amazing, the brisket tender and juicy, the ribs succulent and flavorful, best barbecue around.  The sides were delicious as well, mac & cheese was great, mashed potatoes did not disappoint, ranch beans aren't anything special but they tasted good.  Service was great, waiter was attentive to our needs and accommodated a last minute switch after already putting in the order. Atmosphere is good, not too noisy/quiet, the lighting could be improved though, a single bulb above the table barely allows you to see what you are eating, though the food wasn't there long enough to be seen:)Highly recommended to someone looking for great barbecue ribs, chicken, brisket, etc.~~#~1
I so wish you could do 3 1/2 stars.  i would give it. Not bad chinese.  NYC style.  If you have lived in or around NYC you would completely understand.I LOVE the Fried Dumplings.  SO GOOD!!  Highly recommend them.  Pork Lomein is good to.   Take out for sure.  Not really a place to sit and eat.  you can do it but it is more geared for take out.~~#~0
Two and a half stars, really. This place is really quite strange. Video coffee bar? I don't have much to compare it to, I guess.We'll start with the coffee: traditional espresso macchiato. No microfoam, large bubbles in the milk, too hot to drink right away. The shot was good, but by the time it was cool enough to drink had lost quite a bit of flavor.Very friendly service, on the other hand. Given that Phoenix-foam tends to be subpar, I tend to think that service and atmosphere are almost more viable measures for successful coffeeshops than coffee. (in Phoenix) The actual place was pretty odd. Large paintings of Mexican sugar skulls in the back, nice chairs and tables, an orange faux-finish on the walls... And then the video bar element. Three huge flatscreens on the wall playing pop music videos from the '90s. Very strange, in my opinion. I'm not sure that Cher and Madonna really mesh with coffee shop, but I guess they're trying something new. I had a nice time lounging and it was relatively quiet with regularly good lighting.~~#~0
I had the Potato Balls, they were larger than i expected (i'm used to the likes of Portos) but i was not discouraged from attempting to take them in all at once, alas i failed.. but i was a happy camper.~~#~0
Lovely outdoor seating area, very dog friendly. Don't sit in the back of the outdoor seating area because it smells like propane back there. Had some coffee and just hung out for a couple of hours. It was a pleasant experience. Didn't order food this time but next time I will, because every dish that came by looked magnificent! All of the prices on the menu looked very reasonable for the portion.~~#~1
Excellent in every way.  Attentive and fun owners who tend bar every weekend night - GREAT live music, excellent wine selection.   Keeping Fountain Hills young.... one weekend at a time.~~#~1
We checked out RnR on Sunday (just a few days after opening.) In all fairness, I have to agree with many of the other reviews. Even though they are new, these things are fixable so hopefully the feedback will be taken in the appropriate vein. The building is very cool and the vibe was energetic on a sunny Sunday morning. There was an abundance of waiters but they seemed to be confused and frenetic without a real focus on the customer. The menu is very limited and our server had not eaten most of the items. He was struggling to explain. Our drinks took more than 15 minutes to arrive even though we saw them sitting at the bar for the entire time. Our water had just disappeared. Then the food. I ordered the grill cheese ( a rare treat and when I order it I want it good!). It was cold and overwhelmed by heavy bread. The cheese wasn't melted. I sent it back and they simply nuked it and brought it out. Icky. Our son wanted a kids cheeseburger and the staff kept coming back and forth not sure if there was a single burger or sliders for kids. It became comical after the third person came out. My husband ordered a salmon omelet with several additional fixings. The eggs tasted like box eggs and it was lackluster and flavorless. We even took the time to provide feedback to management but we got a weak smile and "come back and try us again." He made no effort to "make things right" either by comping something else to taste or providing an incentive to come back. There are too many restaurants in town to have to go to one that is less than mediocre. The young crowd may enjoy it for the bar vibe it gives but the majority of the tables on Sunday am were families or middle aged and we saw similar responses at other tables.~~#~1
This place is such a delightful treat. Not only is the Barrio Cafe in what some Phoenicians would called the actual barrio, but it's non-descript on the outside and purely magical within. Not terribly difficult you keep your eyes peeled, Barrio Cafe is one of the best Mexican restaurants in Arizona and is a must try for any Phoenix local. You really can't go wrong with anything on their menu, although their seafood offerings are my least favorites. I am in love with their conchita pibil, which is their slow-roasted pork and they have the best made-at-the-table guacamole in all of Phoenix. Their food is the kind of special occasion dinner that you and all your guests will be savoring every morsel, but save room for one of their delectable desserts! I'm a fan of their flan, in particular. Service is spot on and it's usually pretty packed, so come as early as you can or face a semi-long wait at the bar. Don't worry though, they've got great margaritas. This is the place Tempe's Mucho Gusto wished it could be some day. But it probably won't.~~#~1
I am slightly confused as to what this place is.Is it a coffee shop? yes.Is it an ice cream parlor? well..yes.Is it an antechamber for the hair salon upstairs? kinda.Seemingly the Pink Spot *giggle* is trying to be a few things at once, and vaguely succeeding at those goals.I like the Pink Spot *giggle* for a number of reasons:-location-convenience-ambience-selectionIn all honestly it isnt the best coffee shop that the area offers, but It's another option- and that my friends, is a corner stone of capitalism: consumer choice.Now I won't be making the Pink Spot *giggle*, my local haunt, that spot belongs to Lola, and I would never cheat on my beloved tranny. But for those special nights when I get the strange urge for simultaneous brain freeze and a scalded tongue, i'll go down on the Pink Spot...*giggle*~~#~0
Very Hip Hotel and Comfortable ~ Amazing location ~Great Staff all is good at the Valley HO !!!~~#~1
PCG is the restaurant by which I judge all others. PCG is totally dependable, always excellent. Service is always good, food excellent. i have eaten here probably 20 times and have never had a bad meal. Although the food is not "challenging" in that there are no weird flavors or textures, if you want a great nouvelle American meal for a reasonable amount of money, you need look no farther than here.~~#~1
cant go wrong with a Double Double, fries, and a shake! Always good. Great service. I got some cold fries once, called the corporate office, they sent out some gift cards for our meals, then followed up with a thank you card as well. Not to mention they sent a coupon in a Xmas card that year. You~~#~1
This place is very good.  I have dined here for breakfast, lunch and dinner, but Sunday brunch takes the cake.  Food is all extremely fresh, and tasty.  The best time to go is when this place gets cranking, the style is smaller portions of the food, that have to be replaced very often when busy allowing for extremely fresh food.  Asian food is always good, and the gentlemen behind the line can do custom stir fry for you.  Italian station has fresh pizzas, that once again are made fresh for you, or order a custom calzone like I do.  Mexican station always has the staples, but recently had crab stuffed poblano rellenos!!!!  .  Berto's gelato with like 16 flavors is a great way to end your meal.  If you like buffets, do yourself a favor and make this your number 1!!!~~#~1
Pizza Venice has, hands down, the best pizza in the Valley. In my mind, they've got the best bang for your buck with the XL three-topping pizza deal. Get that with the garlic crust, and you're buying pizza nirvana. It doesn't hurt that the owners are incredibly friendly. Why would I even consider ordering terrible chain pizza when I can get a great pizza for a great price from a locally owned business?~~#~1
We decided to hit up the "Wine Down Wednesday" that was happenin' at Tastings courtesy of KYOT.  Here's what went wrong:The event is from 6-8 so we arrived just a few minutes (3 maybe?) after 6 so we could get a spot just in case it was hoppin'.  We walked in and the hostess (she looks like she's possibly the manager or owner) asked if we were there for the event and then pointed us towards the back room where the event was being held.We walked in and there were about 7 tables and there were people at them all already.  Talk about early bird gets the worm!  We had to wait for about 3-4 minutes for the waitress to finish with a table to find out if we could sit on the patio for the event.  She said yes and that she would be right out to help us.  In the meantime another woman and her friend also took up at a patio table nearby.20 minutes later the hostess/owner/manager looking woman came out and asked if we had been helped yet.  We said no and she left only to return with a small happy hour flier menu which she just handed from a distance and didn't even come over to our table.  I know you're wondering why I would wait the 15 minutes, but I really wanted to see just how bad the service was going to be and frankly, I just wanted some good $2 wine.It's been about 5 minutes and the same woman comes back with full, detailed menus and I asked if the happy hour flier was the deals for the event and she said yes and then asked if we were ready to order.  Um, you just gave us the menus 10 seconds ago...By now I'm ready to just order and enjoy the meal deals from the event.  I look over the happy hour flier and I see some app deals.  They said there was a specialty appetizer menu.  Not so much, but whatever.  I can deal with that.  Then I see the drink section.  The claim for the event was $2 glasses of wine.  I was excited to try some nice new wines on the cheap, but again... not so much.  In reality it was $4 glasses of house wine which only consisted of three different wines that weren't really what I was looking for.  By now, the other women that were outside decided to leave having had enough of this shenanigans.  We decided (after 30 minutes since we arrived) to go next door to Sprouts, get some apps, and have our own "Wine Down Wednesday" at home.I bet there are plenty of people that will have good experiences here and continue to visit happily, but this one experience has caused me to write them off for good (which I don't usually do after one instance).  I wish that I could actually review their wine and food, but the service was so poor and substandard that it's not worth giving them my money.  I understand if the food isn't good at a restaurant - some are just better or more talented than others.  However, any business can and should have good customer service.  I think this is where the cliched line of "if I could give them less than 1 star I would" comes in...Oh yeah, and I slapped down a "You've been Yelped" card as I left.Take that Tastings!!~~#~1
Bad quality ingredients. I ordered a red curry beef and the beef was awful, hard, I tried to chew it for a minute and decided to give up.~~#~1
My son comes here for the tacos but I am all about the chile relleno.  I never had one with potatoes inside, but oh my, this was the best!  My only recommendation would be to order it dry, with the sauce on the side.  I am counting the days until I get back to AZ.  The new location is so much closer to us, I plan on trying all of their menu, but....but... that chile relleno is ....calling....me.......! The tacos were very very good though.~~#~1
I've learned to expect very little from airport restaurants.  Now I've been ruined - I went to Blanco and my paltry expectations were blown out of the water. Prompt and attentive service, flavorful and delicious food, and a delightful assortment of drink options.  I'll have to connect through Phoenix for the rest of my life. I had the grilled shrimp salad, which was fresh, flavorful, and filling. I also had the sangria, which was pretty good. My friends had tacos (fish and carnitas); they practically licked their plates clean.  Try the rice - it is a rich and delectable treat. An added bonus: They were patient as we sat for three hours waiting for our connecting flight. If I ever find myself in this airport again, you can be sure I'll make my way here.~~#~1
What a wonderful restaurant. I can't believe each dish is 475 calories or less and the portions are still a good size. No sauces, no bread, no fries. The fish tacos were delicious, succulent, with just the right amount of spiciness. The grilled, boneless rainbow trout was fantastic. The pane seared, sushi-grade Ahi Tuna salad was to die for. And leave room for dessert....yes dessert. Only $2.50 but arrives in a shot glass size bowl. just enough to stave off the sugar craving.The decor is elegant and sophisticated. Great for an executive power lunch or a date to impress. menu changes 4 times a year and features local, fresh, in 'season' food. Very inventive menu starting mainly around $9 (flatbreads and sandwiches) to $16 for lunch. Wait staff is knowledgeable and attentive.Great food, great atmosphere, great for your waist line. But even if you're not a calorie counter this still ranks right up there for the food quality, taste and presentation.~~#~1
Stopped in here for lunch today joined by Mike C. & Robyn N.  This was my third visit ever to a CB & the first time to this one.  I went with a Reuben Sandwich Plate, which included a cup of Cole Slaw & a cup of Beefy Cabbage Soup.  The service was good at this location, the atmosphere fun, the food delicious & the prices reasonable.  5 Stars!     :-))Reuben Sandwich Plate $8.19~~#~1
I have not been bowling in 24 years,so you can imagine i was worried. But, this place is clean and fresh. On certain nights,(Monday)and a few others you pay a $5.00 cover charge,then everything is $1.00 .Food ,drinks , games and most important bowling games. The instructions were easy. We got shoes in our size then went and picked out a ball. Lots to choose from! Lots of fun!!!   It was a $20.00 night for 2 of us. The workers are very helpful and Friendly. Bathrooms were also clean. I did not see them spray the shoes with Lysol so that was a little gross.But, other than that it was a great time.~~#~1
Their beef gyro's are delicious!  Great portions for what you pay.  And their falafel is really good too.  Not a great portion it seems for an order of hummus, we got like one piece of pita.  Just didn't seem to be much there.  We always do carryout, and either the bartender is really nice and funny, or just werent very friendly.~~#~0
Maybe it was the authentic Gospel music in the background, but our ears were filled with a heavenly chorus as we feasted upon the sacred, and until this morning unknown, pairing of chicken and waffles--a combination rivaled by only bread and wine in it's ability to induce a religious experience.~~#~1
This place is solid...solid...solid...plus its right across the street from my job...the crunchy tacos with chicken, corn salsa, pico de gallo, green salsa, cheese, lettuce and guacamole...yum yum yum...I love their salad dressing so I like to put it on my tacos too!  It is very busy during lunch so expect there to be a line...but do not worry they move quickly and it will not take too long!  They are very friendly there and I cannot complain about a thing...I just cannot say it compares to some of my 4 and 5 star reviews.~~#~0
If I were to ever get hooked on crack... I would want my crack to be these amazing donuts! They are delicious and addicting.~~#~1
Best donuts I have ever had.~~#~1
Considering my experience with a previous dentist, I was hesitant to try a new one. But my experience was absolutely the best.  Foothills Smiles is the best dentist I have been to in the valley!! They are professional, friendly, and reassuring allowing their patients to feel comfortable during the visit.  Most people dread going to the dentist, but I feel motivated to continue going to my 6 month check-ups!!~~#~1
Vitality Health and Fitness is a small gym that offers personal fitness, group fitness and fitness classes. The classes and the training programs are all varied, challenging, unique and fun. The members are positive, full of smiles and easy-going. The gym is not intimidating at all, the trainers are kind and build programs that suit your personal fitness levels, and the cost is VERY reasonable.  My husband and I have been working out with Megan, and she's a doll.  We haven't gone for very long so we'll keep you posted on the impending RESULTS!Vitality also offers nutrition and massage -- which we both plan on checking out!  The owner is delightful and easy to work with. If you have any questions or concerns about your costs or the way you are being treated, she works WITH you to ensure you are getting the level of service that you expect and that the club/program can provide. The owner is honest and respectful, fair and reasonable. I think everyone should contact this club and see if it might work for them - you won't be disappointed!~~#~1
After 6 years of searching I have finally found Laura!  My brows have never really been "bad" per se, but not great either...I have been searching for someone to show me the hidden potential of my natural arches, and Laura did just that.  After only two visits she has groomed my brows into perfect shape and balance. Its funny how such a small change can make such a big difference! I also enjoy the quiet and private suite with the pretty chandelier to look at during my appointments...and she always has great music playing in the background too!Thanks Laura!~~#~1
Just the facts re: full dinner experience:Ambiance: Thinking about redecorating the house to look just like Trader Vic's - unbelievable.Service: perfectly charming, informative and attentive.Drinks: I don't drink, so read every other review for a review of drinks.Appetizer: Beef Cho-Cho - amazingly tender, it melts in your mouth. Great flavor.Dinner: Trader Vic's Calcutta Curries: good & better when you mix in the variety of garnishes.  fun to play around with the flavors.Dinner 2: Chinese BBQ Flat Iron Steak: Amazing.  Crispy onions, mashed potatoes and tender/flavorful steak will make you close your eyes and wish it would never end.Dessert: (don't know the name) vanilla icecream covered in coconut on a bed of chocolate sauce: simple, beautiful and tasty. Overall experience: the best darn dinner experience I've ever had.~~#~1
The last three times I have been here, the hostesses have been so incredibly rude I have to update and ding them a star. The last time was the last straw and we just left turned around and left.Yes, you work at a popular property. That does not entitle you to be rude and nasty. It's weird as it seems to limited just to the front of the house. The waitstaff is usually great, food is great, and cocktails are top notch.Whoever is running this place, its time for a sit down with your girls in the front.~~#~0
Great Mom/Pop store! We've stopped by several times for some fresh produce and to get treats for the kids. We usually sit outside on one of tha picnic tables to eat gelato, while the kids love playing/petting all the animals. Thanks!~~#~1
There was hair in the food. Not just 1 but 2 in the same Bhel Puri dish.The whole experience was pretty bad. There is no indication of how you order your food and when you finally figure it out the food does not taste good. We checked sodas on the order sheet and when no sodas showed up we asked if we were supposed to go and find our own sodas from the front of the store and were told that that was the case.Also the guy at the counter is down right dismissive.Pani Puri was OKPapdi Chaat - boring, no flavorBhel Puri - boring and no flavor before we found the hairsNot worth the trip.~~#~1
I went for brow threading.  Yelena was extremely gentle and took her time making sure they were perfect!  I just found my new "brow lady" and she's just across the street from my office! LOVE IT!!!  Give her a try!~~#~1
I had never been to Rainforest Cafe and I'm glad that I got to try it because I love trying things at least once; however, this will also be my last time going there. We'll start from the beginning: The atmosphere was nice for the "jungle" but it was so loud that I could not hear my wife talking to me. I felt that I had to scream at her to talk. Our waitress was nice but didn't check on us often. We barely understood her either because she speak loud enough. We got our drinks (ten mins later) and my iced tea was good but my wife's chocolate shake was gross. Too much chocolate syrup and it was expensive!! We sent it back so she could get water another 10 mins later. Food delivery was quick and my burger was pretty good but it was plain and $12!! Jeez, so expensive for something so plain!!! I got onion rings for an extra few dollars (they were okay but worth the extra few $$$). My wife got an extra plate of fries and they were a few bucks but they didn't give her more than ten! I like the atmosphere of the restaurant and the theme but they are completely over priced!!!! Not worth it at all! The food was mediocre but left me sick that night. Not as amazing as I thought it would be after seeing it many times in Vegas...~~#~1
I have to say I was slightly surprised when I went to the State Fair this year. Now I wouldn't go as far as saying I was impressed and it's a must for families or friends. My sister and I won free tickets to the fair and reserved seats for The Band Perry Concert off the radio and thought that was a good enough excuse to head that way. We got their around 5:30pm and it was relatively easy to find a somewhat secure parking spot (for $10). We went on a Wednesday so I imagine it wasn't as crowded as a weekend tournament, but this day happened to be a day where you could get in free if you bought three canned food items to donate to St. Mary's Food Bank. Good way to save on admission. I think I would be a little irked if I had to pay $10.00 to get in on top of cost for game/ride tickets and food and everything else. The other nice thing about going on a Wednesday is most of the games and rides are half the # of tickets or 4 tickets per game/ride (not all of them but the majority). Lines were short and you didn't have to wait much for anything. They sell some pretty strange fair food - I mean I can't even imagine eating fried butter, but I did have a fried Reese's Peanut Butter Cup which was pretty good. We went around 7:00 into the Veteran's Memorial Coliseum and it was easy to enter and pretty full once we got inside. We got moved to seats closer than our original section. This is a one time adventure for me and I am glad we went but the fact that it was pretty much free is what made it appealing.~~#~0
This is my go-to spot for mani-pedi's and brow waxing. They do a bang-up job on my poor feet because it takes a lot to get those pups looking good. I have never made an appointment but never had to wait more that 3-5 minutes to be assigned a nail tech. They recently got new massage chairs that don't grind your bones or shake you to death like some chairs do. Also, this is one of the best places I have been for a brow wax. My sensitive skin has taken a beating at many other places but never here. I don't know anyone by name but the employees are all very nice and skilled at what they do. Oh, and they are typically $5 cheaper than anywhere else I have been for pedicures!~~#~1
In Phoenix for a concert and felt like Thai. Found this place on Yelp! and decided to check it out based on the reviews and the fact that it was near the friend we were visiting at the time. The restaurant is in a strip shopping center that we never would have noticed (or found) had we not been looking for it. Oh, but what a magical dining experience! The cashew chicken was the best I'd ever had (and we eat Thai a LOT!) and the chicken satay was exceptional. Loved the veggie Pad Thai and my husband got a vegetarian (tofu) curry dish he loved. Wish this place wasn't 400 miles from my house. I'd be eating here every week!~~#~1
No attitude, efficient lines, clean, well stocked with flat rate boxes and other sundries????? Is this USPS or a dream? Writing Yelp reviews for post offices seems like... weird, or, something, but it feels so right for this location.~~#~1
I don't like the pizza hear and if you go for lunch there are no specials by the slice.  The ranch tastes bottled and tastes gross.  The ingredients are not fresh but rather canned (also gross).  The chicken wings were not that great either.  The atmosphere was nice for a casual place with a couple of flat screen TV's on the wall.  I will not be going back to this place, so hopefully they get better soon since Barro's pizza is going in the area soon.~~#~1
This was my go to Vietnamese restaurant for pho and rice plates not because it's my favorite but because of convenience. Pho Avina is closer to me but that place is terrible so I end up going to this place. It also helps that LeeLee Supermarket is one street over so I get a Viet fix and my Asian needs shopping in one trip. The pho and com tam is average. The service is fast and friendly enough. I do find it a big stingy that they don't bring out the bowl of broth/soup before you get your rice plate unless you ask for it. All in all this place is fine if you just want an average meal; nothing to rave about here. If I felt like driving farther, I'd definitely hit up Pho Van in Chandler for pho or Com Tam Thuan Kieu in Mesa for com tam.~~#~0
Person 1: "So, where do you want to go to lunch?"Person 2: "Hmmm.  I'm not sure"Person 1: "Want to go to Paradise?"Person 2: "Naaah, we've been there three times recently."Person 1: "What about Subway?"Person 2: "I'm so damned tired of sandwiches. . ."Person 1: "Well, here's Qdoba."Person 2: "Qdoba?  Okay, I haven't been there in a while.  We can get in and out pretty quickly and get back to work."That's pretty much how it is.  Nobody really plans to go out and eat at Qdoba.  It's one of those places you decide to go to on the fly or because you've eaten everywhere else.The Mexifood is fair.  Nothing special, nothing bad, nothing to distinguish it.  There's tons of Mexican joints within ten miles that are better, but Qdoba's here in this strip mall.  Haven't eaten here in a while and don't want to drive any further?  This will make a nice alternative, and then you'll be good on this place for another six months or so. . .~~#~0
Satori to Kaigen! (Enlightenment and Spiritual Awakening!)1st review.  Nervous and working on an empty stomach, with the only exception being the half loaf of French bread and herb-butter I had consumed prior to dinner. Thinking Asian all day and being an incapable decision maker, I rely on Yelp and the assistance of a small list and a single 6 sided cube with dots on it.  I jotted down 6 prominent businesses, held my breath and flicked a wrist.  A "2" brought me to La's Thai Cuisine!Peeped the website and open til 9:30, score! My eye spotted closing time was at 9:00 though!  Arriving on the scene at 8:49, poorly reverse parking my Honda in two spots because I was worried that they were closed.  They weren't, I was met by a Thai beauty introducing herself as Lisa.  I humbly asked for takeout, my adventure begins with the opening door...Smells are incredible.  Having thought they were closed, I had forgotten what I was going to order! I rifled through the menu, feeling as if the whole kitchen was watching (they weren't) but she instructed me to take my time; So I ordered a soup, a salad, an entree, a dessert and a side of brown rice. They kindly ask me for my preference on the degree of heat, on each item, I asked for not the hottest but close to the top.#17  Mixed Vegetable Soup: StellarCulinary Thought: Clear, piping, spicy and vegetable packed. Ninja Eating Plan: Gently lay over white and brown rice, alternately.# 9   Papaya Salad (Som-Tum): PhenomenalCulinary Thought: I got shrimp on the side, due to allergies.  This was probably the most awesome experience of the evening.  They even "fenced in" the shrimp within a Masai-esqe cage of cabbage, to prevent their oceanic brine from invading the delicate papaya, sprout and carrot forest. Spice and crunch with every munch. Beautiful.Ninja Eating Plan: Try not to be seen scarfing this down in front of a date, it's that awesome. Fortunately, my sister was only present and she knows I can eat like a pig and sound like one, too.# 53 Peanut Curry (Panang curry style, comes with rice!): UmamiCulinary Thought: I don't like coconut. I do now. The lemon and coconut milk rises through the savory peanut curry.  Tofu was my protein option, it was done perfectly.  Green beans provided great consistency in this masterful crescendo.Ninja Eating Plan: Laid over rice, alternately brown and white rice, interrupted by the occasional, gorgeous, curry-only spoonful.  Coconut Ice Cream: YumCulinary Thought: I was reeling at this point but I wanted to continue this experience.  As I stated earlier, coconut is not my thing but I believe in giving things a fair try, so I did.  Coconut ice cream is delicious. Coconut pulp, or meat, I still have a texture issue with, but the honey swirl throughout the ice cream made this delectable.Ninja Eating Plan: Use the cooling ice cream energy to return your body back to normalcy. Perfect coda for the culinary symphony.I will be back.  I plan to have every dish vegetarian style.  Family-run places are truly number 1.  Overall experience of the Culinary Ninja: PAVLOVDo you hear the sound of a bell chiming?~~#~1
I went to the physical location the first time with my dog Foxy to scope out the place.  The store inside is iitttyyy bitttyyy and not worth going to in all honesty, but the staff that work there are REALLY friendly, and helpful.  Foxy eats Evanger's, which is really hard to find, and the only place I knew of that carried it was 20min away from me.      A month later, I run out of dog food....so I call Goober (after research I find they sell Evanger's for the cheapest price) and they delivered it right to me.  I wasn't home so they left it on my front porch along with a pretty large amount of free dog treats for Foxy !  They left their newsletter, some reference cards, and their product list (which is HUUUUGGGEEE) in a bag hanging from my door.  The reference cards you give out will earn you discounts on your next purchase!  Oh of course- I forgot to mention the delivery was completely FREE of charge!!!  I'll never get my dog food anywhere else.~~#~1
So yummy!! My favorite Mexican place!! Love the chips, salsa, and bean dip. The extra spicy green salsa is so good too. We are regulars here.~~#~1
I have been taking vehicles to this place for 15+ years, mostly for routine maintenance, but occasionally for the other annoying things your car does to you. We have never had any problems with their service or repairs, and they have always been reasonably priced, fair and honest with us.They also refill propane tanks.Note -- this business has outlasted at least two gas suppliers. Previous names include McClintock Unocal and McClintock 76 :-)~~#~1
Thank you Sunflower for having a decent selection of tofu and fake meats so I don't have to drive 25 minutes to Whole Foods. Also I would like to tell you that I really enjoy your produce prices and your friendly staff, especially the cashiers, they are always so pleasant and helpful. While I am at it I should probably apologize for "sampling" lots of your candy from the bulk item bins, those chocolate covered peanut butter filled pretzels are amazing, I promise I always use the scoop. And one more thing, it's really awesome that you carry beers brewed by Rinkukiu Alaus Darykla, the Lobster Lover is DELICIOUS!~~#~1
Private Karaoke at Geisha A Go Go is the coolest thing to hit Old Town in a while!!   My girlfriends and I went this weekend and it was incredible. I have heard a lot about karaoke being the new trend but not until I actually experienced it for myself did I understand why, until now. We had a private room with a flat screen TV and drinks at the flip of a switch (um, can you say bachelorette party?!).  It was so nice to have a night out without actually having to wait for drinks at a crowded bar or being able to hang out with your friends without random guys interrupting with a cheesy line to try to talk to you. It was $75 for an hour in a private room with 10 of my best friends. And by the time you split that between everyone it was well worth the extra expense. Seriously once you try it you will be hooked too! I can't wait to go back!~~#~1
Yes, it's on the Northwest side and its tucked into a non-descript strip mall better known for being the home of Padre Murphy's Sports Bar, but don't let appearances fool you, this is a great gym. The gym offers a large selection of cardio equipment, weight machines, free weights, and group exercise classes. It also has a pool, hot tub, sauna, and steam room. But will really makes this gym special is its kids care facility. It has video games, pop-a-shot, and a giant climbing structure that my kids like so much, they are begging to go to the gym... and it's a lot easier to get a workout done when the kids are excited about going!Definitely a great find and well worth the drive to the Northwest side.~~#~1
What a brewpub should be.  The beers are great. The food, the Slingers (wow) & the service is all top rate.  Lisa, the server was very helpfull. I need say no more.~~#~1
My first visit to Picazzo's is not what I had hoped it would be at all.  A few of my friends who have fine taste in food raved about it and so I had high hopes.  Let me start by saying, I'm not really a gourmet pizza lover.  As a teacher, I have plenty of Domino's and Pizza Hut all the time, and can be quite happy with that, either that or I love a great slice of New York style pie.  Since I am not a huge fan of gourmet pizza and the overabundance of toppings, I checked the menu for a nice plate of delicious pasta.  I was incredibly unhappy to find that they had about 6 pastas and they all sounded bland and/or too strange to order.  Then, I found their sandwich section.  I decided on their Spicy Chicken sandwich that sounded perfect.  But it took awhile for our waitress to come over, so I glanced at the pizzas and found a couple that sounded good too.  Thank goodness I did, because as I ordered the sandwich, the waitress informed me that they only serve the sandwiches at lunchtime!  What?!  That really peeved me off.  What is irritating is on the menu there is a clear line between the section that says "Lunch Specials" and where it says "Sandwiches."  I mean, there is an actual black line drawn between the two...to me, that says that they aren't a part of lunch.  Don't you think?  Instead I ordered the Popeye and Olive Oyl pizza, which has a white garlic sauce, spinach, artichoke hearts, garlic, Kalamata olives, carmelized onions, mozarella, Roma tomatoes, and Applewood smoked bacon.  After I ordered it, I really thought how I truly didn't even want it.  I was really irritated.  My husband and I both ordered our own pizza since we couldn't agree on what we wanted, so he got The Vortex, which basically had all the meats you could possibly think of.  For an appetizer we ordered the garlic cheese bread, which was way too garlicy.  It came with olive oil for dipping...I would have preferred some marinara sauce or something.  After I had ate the bread, I really didn't want my pizza b/c of knowing that it had so much garlic.  I picked a lot of the garlic cloves off along with most of the other toppings...there was just too much on it.  I know for some, they would probably like that...but it just isn't my thing to have too much on my pizza.  All in all, the pizza was pretty good, once I picked off half of the toppings.  The crust was really tasty and had the perfect crispiness and softness to it.  I could have had just had that alone and been happy at that point.  My husband and I both agreed that it won't be a place we go to again, unless it is for lunch time, so I can try the sandwich my mouth had actually been watering for.~~#~0
eeew. It started with a cranky waiter who told me that if I wanted to know the specials, then I should have read them on the board. The food was downhill from there. The entire place smelled like fried onions.~~#~1
Brookstone is the Sharper Image's older and more laid back cousin.  Yea, it's got a similar feeling, but it's more focused on keeping you relaxed and healthy than on funky electronic toys.  The massaging chairs, pads and other devices are enough motivation to stop in alone.  And if you're with a partner who's less interested than shopping, it's a great place for them to just hang out too!  (Trust me - this works.)~~#~1
There is no shortage of Mexican restaurants in AZ and this one is one of the tops on my list.  It's not your average Mexican fast food.  It's a little more pricey but well worth it.  Their bean and cheese burrito is so good (they say no lard and I don't know what else they use to make it good).  Their carne asada and pastor tacos are done to perfection.  I stop by whenever I pass by this place.~~#~1
Excellent food, top-notch service, exorbitantly priced.  Not for budget minded diners...~~#~0
I like this quaint little restaurant although the space is a bit crowded - especially during peak times. Too bad all they really serve is Pizza (there are other things on the menu - but not much else). I thought the Pizza was OK - but certainly nothing to rave about. Desert was awesome -- they have a selection of crepes to choose from which are ALL to die for! Bottom line: Experience is nice and unexpected for Phoenix. Food is not disappointing as long as you aren't expecting a lot. Desert is special.~~#~0
I really want to like MADCAP. I love the idea of playing old b-movies and some forgotten favorites. The boyfriend and I went to MADCAP last weekend to see their Chuck Jones presentation. Unfortunately, we were pretty disappointed, not that it was completely MADCAP's fault but still.My biggest problem with MADCAP is the price of admission. $10! That's more than a new movie. Why should I pay $10 to see a movie that I could get on DVD for half the price? I know the money is going to a bigger cause - having a cool theatre in town - but I just wish it was cheaper. If it was $5 I think I would go a lot more. For $10 it has to be something I really want to see and after not being so impressed by the Chuck Jones things I'm a little wary.  There wasn't even a screen in the theatre - just a white wall.If they showed new independent movies for $10 and old movies for $5 I think they would really have something cool going on. I hope they can figure it out because I'd really like to see the place become what it could be.~~#~0
Needs a new name - now.  The Pischke's of old had such a sad ending.  I appreciated McGrath's effort to keep "Pischke's" alive.  But it is nothing, nothing, nothing like the Pischke's of old.  Call it "The Blue Ribbon Cafe" - take out the PIschke name - I can't imagine that Chris PIschke would have been honored to be remembered this way.  If his restaurant was a reflection of who he was as a person - Pischke's Blue Ribbon Cafe would be the exact opposite of who he was.  The current restaurant is not a laid back, family friendly and yet a bar all at once restaurant that serves an unending array of crazy good sandwiches/salads/etc - the current decor is pretentious, and the food matches that.~~#~1
I have been to this place many times and the food and service is always great. I am so excited to have found a place where I can get freshly made, good food out here in Queen Creek. My favorite is their home made mozzarella cheese. Its great on anything. I frequently order the tomato, basil and Mozzarella pizza and I recently discovered their vegetarian plate which was delicious. The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is casual and comfortable. Don't forget to save room for the amazing ice cream they have.~~#~1
Stayed here for the RocknRoll marathon like 80% of the guests and absolutely enjoyed my stay.the hallways to the rooms were the only slightly blah decor, all other things such as the bedrooms, bathroom, lobby, restaurant and pools were great!Amenities included:1. pet fish (that someone else fed)2. complimentary granola for the race day3. smores for our firepit (next to the pool)4. nice wait-staff that was pleasant and chatted us up5. super fast towel replenishment service (4 girls use up a lot of towels)6. great cabanas -we never had a problem snagging one or two of them7. happy hour, decent food, delicious alcohol...8. cool lobby area with lots of places to looooounge at9. dog friendly10. heated poolslove it!  I will stay here again for sure..~~#~1
I wish I could love this place... It's just tough. I've eaten here several times and just haven't really LOVED anything. My sandwiches have always been dry and kind of bland tasting. Salads have been ok, but I usually feel like I can make them better. Hummus - dry. Dolmades - tasted like the ones from the jar. Ahh, so sad, because it's food that I do normally love. Here is why I gave this a three- happy hour prices are good ($2 or $3 for small plates). With prices like that, I can forgive some of the food quality a bit.~~#~0
This is one of my favorite places to take out of town guests.  It never fails that we laugh so hard our sides hurt!  Always fresh, always funny!  Great place for a date night or family night!  Even my teenagers love it!  I never have to worry about offending my guests because their content is family friendly.  To finish off the night, head down the street to "The Sugar Bowl" for fresh ice cream!~~#~1
I was very sad to see this restaurant go. I wish Anthony the best and hope he opens up somewhere else!~~#~1
Excellent Soutwest breakfast bowl.  Great service.  Very convenient to downtown hotels.~~#~1
I can't help but love this place. I've been going here since, quite literally, the day the opened. I move further away and I keep coming back.The staff is friendly, the food is delicious, the beer selection constantly rotates to new and interesting beers... and this is basically the de-facto hangout for climbers and cyclists! Really can't go wrong with this place.~~#~1
I went to Peter Piper Pizza tonight to celebrate my daughter's 5th birthday! It is a great place for kids to have fun. Being a former employee of PPP I know that we could have had reservations for her birthday and had a party representative help with everything. Unfortunately, this was just a small family celebration. So I ordered the big family meal deal which consisted of two large pizzas and an order of wings. The pizza is always delicious to me, it is not greasy like some of the pizza places out there. We forgot to bring a lighter for the birthday candle so they had one on hand for us to borrow. Needless to say this is a place that the kids love. They can eat great pizza & play which is all kids worry about.~~#~1
OK. So I think that this may be the first business that gets one star from me.  I just flew home from Israel on this airlines.  Boy, they are pretty sad.  I usually don't like to be too harsh on anyone, but this airlines deserves it.  Please, don't think of this review as complaining, but rather a warning to others out there to never fly US airways (Nobody likes a complainer right? Haha.).  Well, not never, but if you have no other choice.  I would venture to guess that this airlines is pretty cheap because of the full flight loads that i encountered.  You could say that is good for them but the service on the planes was not up to par.  I guess I have been spoiled with the likes of Hawaiian Airlines, Nippon airlines, shoot, you can even throw Delta in there.  The flight attendants are rude. This is from both personal experience and from observation of my own.  You know what, I could go on and on, but I really don't like to cry about stuff.  Would I fly US Airways again? No way.  If it was one of the last airlines on Earth?  Maybe.  I just hope that their service of customers get better.  Then again, maybe they didnt treat me well for the fact that I hadn't shaved and looked Talibanish.  Oops.~~#~1
I would not survive without Channel 8. i really don't watch much TV, but when I do, I want it to count.Let me see: Keeping Up Appearances, Coupling, RedDwarf, Antiques Roadshow, NewsHour, Nova, This Old House, Dr. Wayne Dyer, Frontline, Horizon, Scientific American Frontiers, The War, As Time Goes By, Red Green. Plus, tons of responsible programming for kids in the am and afternoon.(I don't think RedDwarf and Coupling air on PBS anymore - but thanks to PBS for introducing me)~~#~1
I had the Crispy Steelhead, and it was delicious! The sweet pea risotto and roasted tomato-chanterelle ragout were a great addition. If you're looking for a great restaurant with an original menu, this is the place to go! Friendly staff and they were quick to seat us.~~#~1
Called last night @ 4:30 and tried to do call ahead seating for 6:30 for a party of 9. We are in town and are here to see some friends. Explained to hostess that some in the group are seniors so would need to have assurance on reservation. I was told to call back in an hour, the thought process by her was that it was too soon to give me a time and they weren't that busy yet. So I did as told and called back and after about 10 minutes of confusion and other waiting I was told we couldn't be seated until 7:30 or we could have seperate booths. I explained that we needed to sit together and 2 hours was the best she could do. I was so frustrated I told her no thanks that we would find other arrangements. She said ok and that was it. Nice job Texas Roadhouse. NOT!!! There is no excuse for not having a reservation system in place, like Open Table. One day there will be no customers to disappoint, then maybe you will get it.~~#~1
Fantastic donuts! Great selection! Coffee was definitely above average!~~#~1
If you want to feel really bad about what you're eating, you'll love Rally's...I tried this place for lunch, after I heard about the "Baconzilla". I love bacon, so this burger sounded like a match made in heaven for me. The burger itself was OK, though I didn't love it. It was two patties, cheese, and about 47 slices of bacon. The bacon was the saving grace, as the burger itself was a little dry and didn't have a ton of flavor. You can also have different styles of "loaded" fries, I had seasoned fries with cheese and bacon. When I think about my meal there, it's amazing that I've lived long enough to write this review...It's a quaint little place, you can either walk up and eat outside or do the drive thru, either way the food is ready pretty quick. In addition to burgers they have chicken strips and a double decker fish sandwich, so it's not all about the red meat. It's not high quality, and it's the furthest thing from good for you, but if you're in the area and you want a greasy burger, Rally's is a good place to try.~~#~0
Just had Daphnes for the last time. In the 3 times that we have ordered from them, they cannot seem to get a simple order right. One Kids Burger with Apple Slices (Nope) one side of hummus(Nope) But they are quick to charge you for the order. Then you call and talk to a girl name Liz and she begins to tell you that they are correct and you the customer are wrong. Even though I have all the food sitting in front of me nope still no kids burger or side of hummus. HMMMMM,.. keep letting her answer the phone and you will see your to go customer base decline. We are an office in Scottsdale that everyday is ordering lunch for the office, Daphnes has officially been removed from the menu book.Nice customer service!!!!!!~~#~1
Pretty good food.  The location is kind of scary, for a famous place.  i was a little disappointed in their lunch menu.  i am not a fan of paying $12 for a lunch plate.  i don't need 10 lbs of food at lunch time, but a nice $4-5 plate of food at lunch would be great.  I might return by myself, because the food is very spicy, and most people i hang out with don't like that.  it was even spicy for me and i don't mind that too much.~~#~0
Way too expensive for a hot dog.  Confusing to eat there too unless you can speak Spanish.  Last time I checked I wasn't in Mexico.~~#~0
I have been here a few times but have to remember to come here more often. I LOVE it! I've never made it past the refrigerated and prepared foods section, but who needs to! You can find everything you need right there. The meat section is beautiful to look at, they have a whole section of prepared heat and eat dinners, side, soups, sauces etc. grab a premade one or grab a few ingredients and make your own! My favorite so far would be the Tub of Alfredo sauce, package of fresh pasta, and package of chicken breast strips ..YUM! Dinner in 20 anyone? ;-)Their Tomato basil soup is Amazing too!! I scored dinner for 3 last night for ......$7!!!! 2 packages of their heat and eat mac and cheese and 2 packages of Tilapia, all ready and in about 10 minutes! Seriously if you are trying to save money and still want to eat good, fresh and easy food then this your place!~~#~1
3 stars - Yelp says - A OKThat means, sure, I'd go back and I should state here and now that the 3 stars might not be all their fault but my fault too.Plan to see mid-week movie with my daughter who teaches at junior high school and after school volleyball and we have plans for 7:45 movie which means time is compressed. Daughter has limited sense of adventure for foods so I figure this place always offers her bail-out choice of Italian. Enough background...Problem is, I had lunch too late and I arrived less than hungry. I'm equivocal what to order. I ask waiter for advice (mistake). I order cream soda and he comes back and asks me what flavor and listing too many choices. I order cherry and it seems to be a club soda with grenadiene (sp?) - mistake.Orders arrive - daughter shocks me by ordering Pad Thai which was quite good. I get winter special of Ishikari - Salmon, cabbage, tofu and rice noodles rather cleverly cooked in a miso based soup in industrial type mini-bucket with oak sealing lid and apparently brought to table from oven. The salmon infusion into the miso was an incredibly delightful broth. The salmon appeared to be generous, good quality but a bit undercooked and I didn't have the time window to do anything about it. The rest...the tofu / cabbage / etc. seemed to derive no benefit from the delightful miso broth.So in the end...I probably could have given them 4 stars because there is nothing inherently wrong with CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe. The waiter wasn't all that helpful but he was available at the most important times and we managed to get orders, served and check paid in time for movie which by other reviews worried me because of our narrow time window and the fact that this place is indeed busy.I would definitely return a much wiser person and next time, I go with my gut instinct and order the Champon as I had intended to the first time.~~#~0
So, I now frequent The Vig.  If you go, talk to Jason, the bartender.  He's quick with the beverages and funny.  Enjoy yourself.  You deserve it!  This place can get packed during dinner hour, though.~~#~1
One thing is for sure:  You will be full when you leave Harlow's.  I think that the huevos are pretty good, but the biscuits and gravy leave a little to be desired, or so say the meat eating friends of mine.  To be fair, this was in comparison to my very amazing freshly made biscuits and veggie gravy (biscuit recipe credit to Mark Bittman's How to Cook Everything).It is a decent people watching locale on the weekends as long as you can stand to wait out in the parking lot until they call your party inside.~~#~0
Honestly, this is the best pizza that I've had in Arizona.  I'm a sucker for wood-fired goodness and fresh mozzarella--Cibo does both to perfection.  Additionally, I've come to appreciate the character and charm possessed by this little gem in a sea of chains and strip malls.    The wine list is not overly extensive, just efficient and thorough like it should be.  The salad selection is full of variety and offers a bright way to begin their dining experience.  Be warned:  Cibo is pretty tiny, causing a wait on weekends.~~#~1
I love the Madagascar coconut white tea! The prices and very reasonable, only downfall for me is they don't list the caffeine content;(~~#~1
WOW!  I am very sorry that it took me so long to convince Bri D. to go here.  We went for brunch and it was amazing.  Absolutely one of the best breakfasts I have ever had.  The johnny cakes were out of this world!  They have a granola-y taste to them, are filled with blueberries, and topped with yogurt and real maple syrup.  It is this awesome combo of sweet and tart that is great.  Despite being three pancakes, they weren't heavy and dense like normal ones.  They made me feel satisfied but not "stuffed" and gave me lots of energy throughout the day.  That's exactly what the awesome waitress said they would do.I love this place!  It is beautiful inside, I love their theme, I love their concept, and I love the food.  Can't wait to try more.~~#~1
Considering what is considered the 'norm' for workout facilities... this place is WAY behind the times.This place would be amazing for 1952- it would then be considered clean, tidy, and cutting edge. There are some actual perks about this place- they do have daycare and plenty of mirrors for me to watch my fat jiggle while I run on the treadmill ;)It's just an utter disaster. When the BF and I originally signed up, we got a couples membership at a newly redone Glendale location and it was worth the monthly membership fee.This place does not need a 'face-lift.' It needs to be gutted and TOTALLY renovated. You just feel a nasty moistness when you walk in the door- which just gets worse the longer you're there... and is even MORE WORSE during the summer. Guys always have the weight benches dominated. There's never any availability for machines (any kind) from 4-7:30pm, then it starts to thin out. Blah bla bla blah bla.Considering this is the "Biltmore" location... huge disappointment. Fact.~~#~1
This place was messy and loud.  The food really wasn't great and the salsa bar looked like a three year old put it together.  Overall the only plus was the tortilla chips that were free before the food.  I will not be back unless one of my friends pays for me~~#~1
great food... love the pad thai....awesome atmosphere...~~#~1
Good Starbucks in the Happy Valley Shopping Center.  Excellent AC in this place and a nice place to cool off from the heat and get a Frap!~~#~0
I honestly feel a bit bad giving Wildflower a three star rating, but I'm honestly waiting for the time when I feel impressed with their food. I've been to Wildflower quite a few times, ordering something different each time. First time was the sweet potato and fig sandwich. Disaster. Next time with the BLT plus. Ick. Next time was Potato Soup. Eh. I don't know what my problem is, everyone raves about this place as being awesome. The nice thing about this location is that I can meet friends here for a mediocre lunch and walk to the movie theatre or Target afterwords.~~#~0
This store used to be closer to 19th Ave & Bell they have since moved and expanded a ton over the last few years. Everything is made fresh daily ceviche, guacamole, salsa's, they have pan dulce delivered every morning yummm. You can pick up the old school soda's here, and good Mexican Favs like Pinguinos, Gansitos, Duvalin, Pelon Pelo Rico, De Las Rosa, and even Bimbo bread just to name a few thing's they carry here. They have natural all organic small game hens that can be stuffed or bbq'd you can ask for their rub they have all kinds of meat most get the Ranchera here for some carne asada you just need to be able to say how many "Libras" (Pounds) and you want them to make it "Preparada" they will put in their special marinade w oranges, onions, and spices in the bag. If your a meat eater you cant go wrong here. I cant get enough of this place!!~~#~1
Love.  It.  Awesome pulled pork, brisket, turkey.  The sides are really good, too.  I feel like it's somewhat expensive, but it's worth every bite, but then again, that's BBQ.  If it's dirt cheap, that means it's not quality meat.Anyway, the 2-pound potato is great, too -- chives, sour cream, butter....~~#~1
Einsteins in general has mediocre bagels at best, and their "schmears" appear to be highly processed.  I've generally given up on Einsteins all together because because their food has really taken a nose dive, as has the service.  I stopped by this location recently because I was driving by and in a hurry, and wanted a bagel (they're supposed be a bagel store after all!).  First, no salt bagels.  Aren't salt bagels one of the standards?  Second, I ordered my bagel with cream cheese (cream cheese being a $1.50 option) to go and that was my real mistake.  Whoever made the bagel didn't even manage to slice all the way through the bagel and put an amount of cream cheese approximately equivalent to a pat of butter on one-half of the bagel.  The other half was basically dry.  Unbelievable.  Needless to say, I was pretty annoyed when I got to work and opened up my bagel.  Stick to any of the local bagel joints like Chompies or Kashmans - they have much better bagels, and they will dump a brick of cream cheese on them for you.~~#~1
The Good: We absolutely love their wings and its becoming a regular for us to go every other Tuesday for their wing deal. We always get the honey hot wings and share a side of either regular fries or the loaded fries.The Bad: I do feel the wings are a bit too pricey, even on the deal days. Also, what is up with their high school hostesses!? They are incredibly rude and give dirty looks every single time we have gone, which is now around 7 times. Someone really needs to put these girls in check. Goodness. This is the reason for 3 stars instead of 4. I would actually give it 3.5 stars if I could.We like the atmosphere and it always seems clean and the servers have been very nice so far.~~#~0
Dilly Dally My Willy WackyBy The RueWhy do I always forget this place,When deciding on where to eat lunch,Here I could really stuff my face,It doesn't matter if it's dinner or brunch.My wonderful, tasty Honey Do,Alfalfa sprouts, turkey on whole wheat,Add a slice of cheddar for you,This sandwhich cannot be beat. Located not to far from the hospital, So you get a great crowd of nurses,The hotties who come here are pivotal,I'll stay until the crowd disperses. Get the soup in a bread bowl,Or a bag of chips if you please,Add a cookie for your hole,I'll say bless you after you sneeze. Bottom line is you cannot go wrong,You'll love whatever you order,Go home and hit the bong,And then make a run for the border. DEEEES NUTS!!!~~#~1
Finally a place to watch local sports with sound.  I always find it unbelievable that many sports bars here in town look past our local teams and support the foreign hoards from Wisconsin, Minnesota, NY, Illinois etc..  Not at Dukes...local first.Please return to your frozen tundras and leave us with the Suns, Cardinals, Devils and Coyotes.The food here is nice bar/pub fare and is always fresh and hot.  Drinks are plentiful and service respectable.  Would like to see a little more variety on the taps but other than that Dukes is a great place to catch a game.~~#~0
Anything I write will not do justice to this awesome, awesome hotel. I've stayed here a good dozen or so times over the past three years and it's always fantastic. I love all the rooms. If you can get a suite, you're an extra lucky duck, but even the basic rooms are adorable with phenomenal bathrooms.The bar and restaurant is also great, with fantastic appetizers, wonderful specialty cocktails, and fun rat pack music. Breakfast is better than most restaurants, forget about comparing it to standard hotel fare.The location is also good, with plenty of shopping, restaurants and bars within easy walking distance.This place is not within my normal price range at all, but it is worth every penny and I would never stay anywhere else in the Phoenix area.~~#~1
And now ladies and gentlemen, the category tonight: Things that make Siu-Wok A-OK in my book.Here we go....#10 - I can actually understand the people that answer the phone#9 - The sweet burn on my tongue after eating a mouthful of Kung Pao Chicken#8 - The lack of lasting gastral repercussions from eating said Kung Pao Chicken#7 - The friggin huge area to which they will deliver, for a minimal $2 charge (beware their website says it's a buck-fifty, but the gas crunch is effecting everyone)#6 - The pork fried rice that is literally one part rice mixed with one part tender / tasty pork#5 - The place is actually clean#4 - The coupons attached to the menus that they send to my home at regular intervals#3 -  I can call in an order, hop in my car to pick it up, and be back watching quality reality programming within 15 minutes#2 - They have Mr. Pibb on tapAnd the number 1 thing that makes Siu-Wok A-OK in my book...Eight... yes count 'em, eight, yummy soups that they will deliver to my door when I just can't bring myself to change out of my pajamas!!!~~#~0
Man oh man... I can't decide whether I want to review this place or not under the auspices of "if you don't have anything nice to say..."All I have to say is this: We ordered food. It came totally wrong. I asked for a vegan salad, not specifically, but that's how I ordered it, and it came with chicken and cheese. This just shows a complete inability to read the order. People make adjustments all the time. I have worked at a restaurant. I have fucked up. I should have been lashed 40 times! Read what people order! So when I got the wrong salad and saw what an unbelievable disappointment it was going to be, I ordered a veggie sandwich instead, which, to their credit, they delivered and took off the bill. The best customer service in the world could not overcome this sandwich. It was a monumental fucking embarrassment. I cannot believe they let that thing out the door. I ate it because I was starving but I would have liked to have driven it back there and go through it, ingredient by ingredient, with the preparer... Explain to me how this is appealing to the eyes, mouth, stomach, etc.I just hated it. A lot. Sorry, I'm sure you're nice people with good intentions.~~#~1
I brought in six pairs of shoes to Ariel to see if he could put new heels on them (I wear the spiky-heeled high heels).  For $12, not only did Ariel put new heels that perfectly matched each color, size and type of heel (and even filed them just a hair so that they would wear smoothly), but he also put a lot of work into fixing the front of them.  Many of my shoes had toes that were worn, shredded or faded; Ariel made them like absolutely new.  Amazing!My shoes are not Prada or Gucci.  They are mostly Nine West with leather uppers and man-made everything else.  :)  However, Ariel took amazing care of them as if they were "the king's" shoes.  It is so great to have my favorite pairs of shoes back.  I will return.  Thank you, Ariel!~~#~1
Best nights to go to Postino's are Mondays and Tuesdays.  They offer $20 deals where you get 4 slices of bruschetta out of the 12 that they offer and one whole bottle of the house wine.  Each bruschetta slice is probably the size of maybe your hand with your fingers outstretched -- if you're a petite girl  :) ...  They then cut each slice into 4's.  Perfect for sharing!We went on a Monday night after 8PM and ordered 2 bottles of wine, the 2 orders of the bruschetta (which were 8 slices for those that can't count), and a bowl of olives.  The total came out to about $50...that's a little over $13/person w/o tip!!  AWESOME!!    PLUS, they have complementary valet parking. Everything was just fantastic, I've never had fig before and they made my experience there quite memorable.  I definitely recommend you come in, regardless if it's for their $20 deals on Mon/Tues or not.  They've got GREAT food and I WILL be back.~~#~1
I agree with Tracy, my wife and I are big fans of Fiorella's. Definitely a treasure for the northwest valley. The service is great and the food is delicious. Prices are a bit higher than other dining options in the area, but the friendly people and yummy food are worth it.~~#~1
Best UNIQUE breakfast / brunch / lunch spot.  This tiny place may look like a boring little bakery, but think again!  SIt outside on the small patio area, ck out the GR8 crepes! savory, breakfasty, sweet - u pick or choose! Hubby luvs lox & cream cheese & capers.  I luv the chicken, aspargus, basil, feta :-)  Mmmmmmmm.~~#~1
Places like Made make me realize that there is hope for my life in Phoenix.  It is a cute converted house shop that carries a wide array of stuff that you won't find easily elsewhere.  There is lots of cute baby stuff that I would laugh at if I ever saw a baby wearing.  The jewelery is unique and cool- it made me feel like I had etsy right in front of me, live!  They have some good books around and some key David and Goliath pieces.  I heart places like Made, so therefore I heart Made.~~#~1
Lately I have been addicted to a good Caprese style sandwich and Pane Bianco's is AWESOME!  I read the previous reviews so I went there expecting a crowd and nowhere to sit.  This did not detract from the experience for me because the quality and freshness of the food was more than enough to get and keep my attention.  The staff were very friendly and helpful, being from the Atlantic Northeast I have high expectations when it comes to Italian done well with personality to boot. I did not want to wait till I got home to eat my so good smelling prize so I went outside to find picnic style tables and benches.  It was way to hot to sit outside and I was craving iced coffee so I went next door to Lux and was both surprised and relieved to find many of their patrons with Pane Bianco bags openly eating their lunches with drinks from Lux to claim patronage.  Can't wait for a hopefully air-conditioned expansion.~~#~1
A great place for midday healthy food, thin crust good pizza ( try wild mushroom & arugula), salads are great too & the best part that serve pretty acceptable nice wines. It is not an average American food eatery, it is definitely for those who are looking for healthy low calorie lunch.~~#~1
The food reminded me of my mom's home cooked meals. The beef with red salsa was super good...and not to mention the warm, handmade tortillas. The prices were decent, the service was excellent and the food was great. ;-)~~#~1
I've never been to this location before. My husband had taken his car here previously, and asked me to take it in today (there was a nail a front tire). The second I stepped through the doorway I was greeted, even though all agents were busy helping other customers -- excellent customer service to acknowledge I'm there! Less than a minute later I had a gentleman walk me out to the car and look at it. He tested to see how far in the nail was, and realized it didn't puncture, so he took it out and said the tire was fine. I went there knowing my husband is WAY overdue for new tires, so asked for a quote. He gave me a few options, and told me what driving habits they'd be best for. He also gave me the warranty information without me asking for it, and included it in the price instead of "shockingly" adding it in when I would pay like most places would. I never thought for a second that I was being oversold. It was amazing because I despise going anywhere having to do with fixing my car. Quick. Clean. Friendly. Intelligent. Honest. That about sums up this place. I'd recommend it to ANYONE and tell you to go out of your way to visit this location.~~#~1
Tucked on the western edge of the Foothill Acres neighborhood in North Phoenix or what I would call "The Slope", Try Me Bicycle Shop has been in business for nearly 40 years and has been collecting the odd part for every type of bike over that time. The showroom is filled with cruisers and comfort bikes, new and used. No high end bikes here but they do have an inventory of old and hard-to-find parts, good service and free air that makes this place.~~#~1
Maybe I should have had a hot dog but I crave Chicago's Italian beef,  I didn't get it here just some greasy old beef of some kind,  use beef broth if the meat gets dry, not a whole can of olive oil,  YUK!  It didn't have that good Italian beef flavor so I asked for giardinara to add some flavor,  it was very oily too and I had to pay extra for any peppers either hot or mild. No stars for that beef,  the only saving grace was it didn't make me too sick,  I expected to be sick for days not just one day!~~#~1
Ok, so iv been a Starbucks junkie for years....until i discovered dutch bros! This location is my favorite, although they are all good. My favorite thing about dutch is you can order ANY blended drink sugar AND fat free. You cant do that with any frappes at starbucks. You cant beat their customer service either, all the employees and incredibly nice and upbeat, always greeted with a smile! I once ordered a blended double coc coffee and it was too frothy for my liking so i stopped at the location in tempe since i was going that way to order a new one..they exchanged my drink, apologized and sent me off with a new drink at no charge. added bonus is the stamp cards, so if your an avid coffee drinker like me, you'll be saving some money to. Quick drive-through for on the go.~~#~1
This place always pleases! Their sandwiches are always great, bread is great, pizza is AWESOME, and their short ribs are great. The food is SO fresh! The waiters are kind and friendly. When we asked if they had some of their awesome ice cream, she kindly told us the freezer broke. I heart the deli!~~#~1
Yes, I've shopped here.  DIRTY as expected, maybe it didn't start as a Big Lots.  Service is hit and miss and usually they're great at helping.  Sometimes when asking for a reduction on damaged items, it's a good answer from a rare on the ball, positive employee.  Other times, even though it's up to the manager, the clerk is crying with a such a dirty glare that you can hear them thinking "you cheap xxx", that it's already reduced (on clearance).  It's still damaged so what's your beef w/wanting a little more discount?  What?  We don't need no stinkin' discount on the discount???~~#~0
Love Love Love! All you need to do is order dessert here. It comes in small shot glasses & the flavors explode in your mouth..~~#~1
Loved my haircut. Walked in and waited for just a minute. The stylist cut exactly like I wanted and I walked out paying 20 which included the tip.~~#~1
Whatza Culvers?  I drove by this place as it was being built; didn't know what it was, but "butterburger" and "frozen yogurt" caught my eye..... so I decided to visit it on 2011-05-30 (dine-in).  Looks like it just opened, and it was busy.Turns out this place is a fast-food chain based out of Wisconsin that I had never heard of before... kind of like a cross between an In-and-Out and a Dairy Queen.  Menu is a bit daunting the first time - a burger or a sandwich?  what side?  smoothies, or regular drinks?  You walk up to the counter, place your order, take your number to your table, and they deliver your order to your table when it's ready.The burger patties are different... they're about 1/8" thick and seem pressed/fried.  The buns are nice and soft... ingredients are fresh or properly cooked.  Flavors are there... but it is a different style burger than what we're used to seeing.  I tried the cheese curds; just wish they hadn't breaded/deep-fried them.  I like my curds natural.  A fountain drink completes the "value basket" deal.Their frozen yogurt or "concrete mix" sealed the deal.... we tried the banana split (nice) and their "brownie cookie dough".  Kinda hard to screw up frozen yogurt!  yum! Okay, so I now know what a Culvers is.  It's a good change-of-pace from the other fast food chains.  Not sure I'd go out of my way just to come here (unless I'm really in the mood for it).   I'll have to try other items, but for now, its a 3 star rating.~~#~0
Great for young kids... tons to do and see~~#~1
Obsessed. Like, I've-got-the-Twangy-Tart-withdrawal-shakes level of addiction to this place. Please make one in Arcadia! Pleeeaaassse.~~#~1
Loved the winkie!  Eat your vegan meal next door at Green and stroll over to Nami for dessert.~~#~1
I have been patronizing Casey Moores for 10 years and have never had a bad night!  Great for people watching and the service is always great!  Get there early or it will be standing room only!~~#~1
Every time I come here the staff is so rude! Its the closest bar to my gate so I'm kinda stuck. Hey staff, can you please pretend to like people????~~#~1
I have been saving my 100th review for my favorite restaurant of all time. We found Thai Basil over a year ago now and have been loyal customers, going at least once a week and sometimes more than that, since last July. Everyone who works here is super friendly, and they know us now and know what we like to order by heart. We just walk in now and they see us and say "Spicy noodle, tofu, hot, right?" Its pretty great having a place that knows my regular order. I have tried most of the menu items. The garlic eggplant is also pretty great. The thai basil is also amazing. I have generally liked everything I have had here except the curry. I never have had a good curry experience. Both of the times I ordered it I ended up with long black hairs in it (which they quickly replaced with a new order) but I just wasn't a fan. Maybe it's because of the coconut milk and it makes it too sweet. The spring rolls are also the best here out of every spring roll I have had anywhere. Before I went vegan again last year we also got the fried banana ice cream pretty often. That is pretty amazing. If you eat dairy, you have to try it at least once. Thai Basil is one of our regular spots to eat out, and we hope its here to stay for many more years to come. I don't know what I would do without my spicy noodles!!!~~#~1
I reeeeaaalllyyyyy wish that I could give this a 4, but I can't do that in good conscience.  The food was great, but the service was downright abysmal.In a fit of random adventurousness, I thought it would be fun to try a new kind of food for me.  I'm typically a weenie and afraid of anything "weird" so this is a big deal for me.  We drove out here on Friday night and at around 6 or so the restaurant was about half full.  We stood at the door for entirely too long while we waited to be seated.  When we were at our table, we waited entirely too long to get menus.  When we knew what we wanted, we waited entirely too long to place our order.  You get the idea.  Thankfully the food came out fairly quickly.  I ordered the vegetarian plate that had collard greens, some kind of cabbage/carrot/potato thing, red lentils, and some bean/carrot/onion thing.  As with all dishes, it was served with the injera, a weird sourdough crepe thing.  I was a little weirded out that the bread thing was served cold, but I got used to it quickly enough.  Everything on my plate was yummy, but if I were to rank it, my favorite would be the lentils, followed by the collard greens, then the potato, then the carrot/bean thing.  Eating here was a fun experience for sure, and not having any silverware definitely made for some creative feeding procedures.  I would probably come back here if the mood for Ethiopian food struck me again, but I would really hope that the service would be better.  Since everyone else mentions great service, I am going to assume we came at an "off" time.~~#~0
I dined at this restaurant on a Saturday morning and was actually the very first guest.  I got greeted by the hostess and was promptly seated.  The service was phenomenal from when I walked over the door step and the ambiance is the restaurant was amazing .  I ordered the smoked salmon as an appetizer and the daily scallop special as the entree.When my salmon dish came out I said to my self "WHAT in the hell?" Two extremely thin slices of salmon, little salad, and a piece of bread with some aioli on the side.  Salmons cheap and they charged me $15 for this crap?  I work in the food industry and the food was crap.Next, the entree.  The waiter described the the scallop dish like it was heaven on earth.  Explaining to me how delicious this special was.  So I took his advice and ordered.  When the dish came out I said to my self again "What in the HELL?"  Four small scallops, 2 baby carrots, broccoli rabe, and cilantro sauce.  The scallops weren't seared enough, the broccoli rabe was brown and mush, and the baby carrots were still raw.  The funny thing was.  The sauce didn't even resemble any cilantro flavor at all.  I could of made this dish 1000x better and the entree took a big hit in my wallet, $32 for crap.The meal came out to roughly $60 and I left that restaurant to never try it again.  I could of gotten some pho for $8 would of been a hundred times happier than spending money that wasn't even mediocre.~~#~1
Cool place but don't try to arrange a special event. The proprietor was arragont, unflexible and unethical when I held my friend's bachelorette party at The Duce. Be warned!~~#~1
I am in love with the cinema suite! Being able to stretch out your legs on the LazyBoy recliner is the way to enjoy the movie. The chair is spacious and the room is not crowded with viewers.  The foods are at a reasonable price and the server is nice.For movie that are 2+ hours long, watching movie on the recliner is the best experience. Also great place to go on a date :)~~#~1
Marcellino's was an amazing romantic dinner experience.  I had their fresh pasta w/mushroom truffles and lobster.  The combination was amazing.  I also had the white wine that's made by a friend in Italy.  It was tantalizing and really lingered on my pallet.  The homemade tiramisu was a blissful ending to dinner.  The staff is attentive and very helpful.~~#~1
Restaurant 28 is a solid hole-in-the-wall that's pretty easy to miss, but it's definitely worth a stop.  On my visits I've gotten brisket and other barbecue, and my friends swear by the chicken and say it's some of their favorite chicken in the Valley.  The hush puppies are great- the greens are good too.Another review said it well when they said this place doesn't underseason food.  Every time I've gone it hasn't been bland- it's got some great flavor and it's tasty stuff.It's in a pretty dull area where there isn't much else to do, or I'd be out there more often.  It's a tiny place too but I've never been in and had it be hugely busy or busy to the point that waiting was crazy.Definitely recommended, and I hope they're able to grow and thrive.~~#~1
The Renaissance Festival is a place where everyone and anyone can venture to in order to awaken their medieval passions and expose a side of them no other place can reveal.  Here people can be themselves without fear of being judged.  They can dress in clothing appropriate to the era, eat as citizens of the renaissance age would eat, and live a day in the shoes of people whose lifestyle consisted of these aspects every day of their lives, all while having a merry time.What's fascinating about the Renaissance Festival is it is an escape from the everyday bustling industrial environment known to people of the 21st century.  Once you pass through the gates, you are immersed in a culture rarely seen these days.  Men, women, and children of all ages absorb the spirit of the festival and change into someone only such a place can expose.  Immediately you are compelled to have high spirits as people dancing, shopping, and just continuously enjoying themselves welcome you to the festival.  From there the opportunities are limitless for there are twelve stages of continuous live entertainment, jousting tournaments, over 200 artisans displaying a variety of unique wares, and displays of ancient skills like glassblowing, leatherworking, weaving, woodcarving, blacksmithing, candlemaking and pottery.One specific entity of the Renaissance Festival that stands out in my mind is the old coin striking mill tucked away and blended into in the strips of stores surrounding it.  Here, a family of three (father, mother, and daughter) work to produce unique coins crafted into necklaces by means of a punch press.  The store offers some 100 different punch dyes each a symbol possessing its own special meaning.  The categories range from mythological symbols, to astrological, to even ancient Egyptian.  Once their customer has chosen two of their own special symbols they want imprinted on a coin, they place a blank, either bronze or silver, between each dye and clamp it to a press.  Then a heavy weight is hoisted a few feet above the dyes and then suddenly dropped onto the head of one dye, eternally imprinting the symbols on the coin.  What's distinctive about this certain store is they can fulfill the needs of any customer that they are presented with by owning such a broad spectrum of dyes applicable to anyone due to the meaningful descriptions given to each symbol.  Additionally, what captivates people is the fact that the coin is formed before your very eyes three feet away, making the production a very personal thing for the consumer.  If you and your family are venturing to the Renaissance Festival in Arizona anytime soon, which I would undoubtedly recommend, be sure to stop in on this special experience not attained anywhere else close by.~~#~1
In one word...excellent!  My fiancee and I had an amazing time here last summer, when we were upgraded to a Spa Casita Suite because the hotel had found out about our engagement, which happened right before we left for our trip.  The room was huge, the grounds were beautiful, the pool was awesome, and everything there was so peaceful.  The concierge helped us with directions to anywhere we wanted to go and the location was great as well...not far from the main drag, but somewhat hidden from the outside world.  We are hoping to return soon.~~#~1
Holy AMAZING.  I went here this past Saturday for a baby shower in one of the private dining rooms and was absolutely blown away by the food.  We had a spread which included Mac & Cheese, Sliders, Chopped Salad, some bread and french fries.  I'm still thinking about those sliders and the french fries.  I can't WAIT to go back and order from the full menu. As is par for the Sam Fox course; the decor is over the top.  I need to find out who designs these places and have them make over my house!~~#~1
After hearing all of the hype on diners, drive in and dives and reading the yelp ratings, we decided to try it.  We waited over 30 minutes  for a table.  The place is small and outside of a dungy motel.  The service was extremely fast once you got in the door and the waitstaff are very friendly.  I had a waffle and it was good but nothing memorable.  My partner had an omelette with portguese sausage that he loved.  The hash browns were so buttery and they were good.  I wouldn't make a special trip back.~~#~0
Great experience at the Phoenician, specifically Il Terrazzo. We normally buy many loaves of bread from them at OTFM (Old Town Farmer's Market). They were absent yesterday so we called in an order & went directly there to pick it up.Was gorgeous of course & they were as nice as pie.And the important part is that the bread was fabulous as always (olive walnut, chocolate cherry sourdough, farmer's rye, wheat sourdough, rosemary sourdough, baguette).~~#~1
Great Frozen Yogurt. Helpful staff, clean enviroment.~~#~1
Yikes...I won't be going back.  The ordering system is confusing. The staff also seemed confused. The food was very bland and pretty tasteless.  THIS PLACE IS NOT EVEN IN THE SAME LEAGUE AS HONEY BEAR'S NEAR THE AIRPORT!! Skip this bland chain, and go to Honey Bear's!~~#~1
Excellent burgers and sweet potato fries~~#~1
Fabulous service tonight and it was crowded!~~#~1
I love Scottsdale Child Care & Learning Centers. My daughter started going there when she was 10 months old. The teachers are wonderful. Not only are they nurturing and kind they are also very interested in each child. My Daughter  has been attending for 6 months now and has graduated to room 2 for toddlers. She knows over 30 words and I attribute much of that to Scottsdale Child Care. She has loved all her teachers and welcomes with open arms each morning when I drop her off. I would recommend this center to any parent, especially if you are nervous about leaving your loved one for the first time.~~#~1
The Choice Hotel chain continues to be my preferred properties of the mid-$ range hotels.  The only issue I had with this one was the noisy A/C unit in the hallway right outside the door.  Other than that, it was clean with a friendly staff.~~#~0
This place was a huge surprise and a huge relief!Being a foodie, and quite the fan of healthy food, this place definitely lives up to those expectations.  If you've ever been to San Francisco, then you'll definitely get that feel when you enter the cafe.It's got a great atmosphere, and the menu is by far the best when it comes to serving healthy "organic" foods.  I know that many places in the valley claim to serve healthy food, but serving "all-natural" and locally farmed foods doesn't necessarily mean it's healthy.  People that are true foodie's know exactly what I mean.I ordered the Dragon Bowl with quinoa and it was delicious.  I'm excited to try this place again.~~#~1
Based on Yelp reviews, I went to check this place out while I'm working on assignment in Phoenix. As promised the food was great, the service was great and I got to meet the venerable Thomas.I sat at the bar and the boys took care of me. The Fez Kisra sounded good, but I should have listened to Russell's recommendations. I will definitely try those next time, which will be soon.The wine selection was varied, but didn't blow my mind. I stuck with whites and found that the one that sounded the best wasn't nearly as good as the most popular (shockingly).The place combines hip and tasteful decorating, good music, great food and a nightlife atmosphere. Definitely seems like a great place for a night out with the guys/girls if you don't want to be overly bothered.~~#~1
Still solid, still delicious. I love this place!~~#~1

I just wanted to add that in addition to party and catering equipment, they also rent heaps of tools and equipment. Think hedge trimmers, lawn aerators, cement mixers - stuff you might need for a once a year or special project, and so, don't want to invest in the equipment.In our case, we needed a chainsaw to take down some dead stuff from last winter's freeze, an unwelcome sapling, a dead tree, branches encroaching the roof, and to tame some monstrous oleanders.I was just about to head to the tool rental department at that big box home improvement store, when a friend mentioned A to Z. I gave them a call, and their prices were competitive. Plus it had that feel good factor of being a local biz.The process was pretty easy. We got a thorough tutorial on chainsaw operation and safety, and were on our way to some serious arboreal carnage.Pro tip: rent on Friday after 4pm. You can return it Monday morning, and only be charged for one day (Saturday), since they are closed on Sunday.~~#~1
I like perusing Buffalo Exchange, but, whenever I bring some clothes in for store credit, I end up disappointed. They seem to give you very little credit for good items, and they are very picky. So I clean out my closet, take it to Buffalo Exchange, and come back with 3/4ths of the stuff. Discouraged, I set it on my floor and it sits there making my room dirty for months.I would suggest going in to trade during an off time (not a weekend) when there will be less people trading. They may spend more time looking at your items. They also prefer the items to be in season, so don't clean out your sundresses until May-ish if you don't want to have to bring them back home.~~#~0
I can always count on Sacks.   It is always fresh and always tasty and the sandwiches are so creative that years later I'm still not sure how they get those fabulous blends and tastes that they do.   I try to hit lunch a little off the lunch hour and then the crowds are not so bad and I can find parking but, its worth it to eat a little latter when I know the meal will be so satisfying I can go back to work and be so productive.   Sacks is my "go to place" when I have a guest or friend that I want to be well fed and satisfied too.~~#~1
Decades ago when this festival was up and coming, and I lived in Tempe, I would go to this street fair as we called it then two or three times while it was going on. Today I went with a friend. The festival has grown by blocks now. It's pretty big, I think they claim 400 vendors! That has to include the food vendors. I had my fry bread taco. It was super good and $9 bucks. I looked for something to buy but left with nothing. The things I liked most were huge home items and big ticket prices. I saw a few handbags of interest but not within my budget either. It use to be that this festival would have jewelry, matted photography and pottery a college student could afford. That's still my budget this year, unfortunately - but such priced things could not be located here this year. So I'm disappointed with the festival offerings. Parking covered & uncovered was $10 if you could not find free street parking. There wasn't enough ice cream vendors in my opinion but there was plenty of food vendors and the neighboring eateries were also busy and offering variety. The entertainment was very limited. I hope they will seek more entertainment in the future especially since they claim its one of the top 20 street festivals in the country.  Otherwise there isn't much to stick around for unless you have deep pockets or want creative ideas.~~#~0
Best Mexican food in phoenix... very reasonable prices...~~#~1
After repeat visits it just gets worse - the service, that is.  It was as if we were held hostage and could not leave for a full 25 minutes because that's how long it took to receive hour check after several requests to several different employees.  Female servers might be somewhat cute but know absolutely nothing about beer and this is a brewpub.  I asked if they have an seasonal beers and the reply was no, that they only sell their own beers!  Even more amusing is their "industrial pale ale" is an IPA but it is not bitter.  So, they say it's an IPA but it's not bitter, it's not a true-to-style IPA.  Then people say "Oh I don't like IPA's" and want something else.  Their attempt to rename a beer/style is actually hurting them.  Amazing.The menu was not the regular menu, just a small list of about 4-5 choices.  To make it worse, the actual menu on every table was wrong, yet the kept the menus on the tables anyway.  I heard 3 separate tables order the fried raviolis but they did not have them.  This place is *only* in business because of the location, location, location.~~#~1
Wanted a restaurant within walking distance of our hotel so picked this one.  Was ok:  Nothing major to complain about, but also really nothing to rave about either.  There are better restaurants to choose from.~~#~0

Brought my parents here for lunch last time they were in town.  Dad loved his gyro. Mom and I both got large salads, hers chicken and mine gyro meat.  SO much delicious food for not a lot of money.  Between my Mom and I's leftovers I had a full dinner to eat later.  Hooray for pleasing the parents!!~~#~1
Okay, so I have a little bit of bias towards Nordstrom.  I freaking love Nordstrom!  The store is always clean, and the staff are always friendly.  I have never had such good service anywhere else.  I especially love that Nordstrom will return or exchange an item with no questions asked.Aside from the service, the selection is very nice.  I always go during the half yearly sale, so that I can get some good deals on my designer duds!I am big on shoes and the selection is very good.  They always have some cool shoes that I can't seem to live without.  Also, the staff in the shoe department are very good on helping to make suggestions when I am not sure what I want.If you go, go in June or  January when the sales are great!  Make sure you check out the shoes!~~#~1
While I love that it is Native American owned and operated, the best thing about this restaurant is the food - as it should be.  I don't go out to eat to be entertained or charmed - just fed better than I could be at home and that is exactly what this place does.  The food is amazing. The fry bread isn't greasy and I don't know how they do that.  The meals are flavorful, filling, and reasonably priced.  The only thing I would do is add some tomatoes to the tacos but that is a minor quibble.  If you want to go out for a delicious meal in a casual place and not pay a lot for it, GO NOW to the Fry Bread House.~~#~1
i dunno what the deal is...but i was not terribly impressed with the pretzel fondue. the food was actually nothing to write home about. however...the adult beverages were superb! bacon infused bloody mary? hell yes! if you're a gin fan (and i am) then you must try velvet death. that's it, end of review.~~#~0
My wife and I have made two trips to Roberto's from Dana Point, CA (400 miles) and we haven't been disappointed.  Although its not the only reason for our visit, a stop at Roberto's is a must when we're in the Phoenix area.  I have tried, and thoroughly enjoyed the al pastor tacos, beef chimichanga burrito, and I really like the way they crisp up the carnitas.My wife judges a Mexican restaurant by the quality of its chile relleno and says this is the chile relleno she has been waiting for: two to a plate, great presentation and delicious.  The light breading allows the flavors of the chili and cheese to dominate the palate as they should.She also recommends the tortas she had at breakfast. The bread, light and toasted perfectly, hugs a generous helping of carne asada (with fajita style onions and peppers), and if you like, guacamole.  Pair that with a cup of their terrific coffee, or if you have never had Jamaica, a delicious Mexican beverage brewed fresh from flowers, try it.  Either way you have a breakfast you won't forget.Oh, and by the way, the members of the local fire department showed up to order breakfast while we were there.  If they are eating there, you know it's good.  Just had to thank them for their service.  This is truly a restaurant where family meets family, Roberto's and yours.And for you insiders, we both love Roberto's homemade tamales.  Although they're not on the menu, we have been fortunate enough to take some of their tamales home during both of our visits.I believe tamales are normally made for the sale in the store on Thursdays (check with them to be sure), but they don't last.   On our first trip in 2008 to their old location, we stopped in for lunch (excellent) and were told that they were bringing in homemade tamales that afternoon.  We returned that night for dinner and to pick up some tamales that they kept for us.During our most recent trip we stopped in for breakfast on a Saturday.  But, fortunately for us, they were making tamales for a catering job the same day and sold us some of their extras.  We again returned in the evening for dinner and to pick up some tamales.These tamales are just like I wish my (Chinese) grandmother used to make.  Check with them to see when they're available.  They're really worth the extra effort.Although Roberto's delivers, I regret that they won't come to Dana Point.~~#~1
When I mean 5 star, I mean 5 STARR...but this place is SPECTACULAR!! Pavle & Charleen are such a fantastic duo....they really know how to make your dining experience exquisite!  The food, not to mention the service, is truly unbelievably delicious!! If you want to have some amazing food and get top notch service while doing so, the time has come for you right here in beautiful Arizona!!HATS OFF FOR FnB!!~~#~1
WOW!  Great donuts!  Honestly you can't eat just one!  I loved the plain glazed and the old-fashioned!  Not like the franchise donut shops, these have the real bakery taste!~~#~1
Saw this place while I was picking up pizza for my kids.  I didn't want pizza thought I would go in and give the tamales a try.  I haven't regretted that decision at all.  The chicken tamales are the BEST!  They are super spicy, the way I like.  The beef with red sauce is great too, not very spicy at all.  The masa in all the tamales is flavored wonderfully.  I am hooked on these tamales.~~#~1
I was in Phoenix a few weeks ago on a business trip. Lucky me, Thai Elephant was right across the street from my hotel! This is a tiny little joint, maybe 20 tables. The menu is like a book, there is so much to choose from, rice dishes, noodle dishes, soups, appetizers. My coworker and I settled on a red curry dish with chicken and I had a sweet & sour dish (yeah, it sounds trite, but I was in the mood and it was so delicious!) We had tons of leftovers, which we shared with a homey down the street, I hope he enjoyed it. Highly recommended, and if I'm ever back in town, I will visit again.~~#~1
It was 3:45pm and I'm about to jump on a bus to the light rail.  We have no reservations for Pizzeria Bianco, but a couple of friends just got in line and were waiting to get some wine.  Useless fact: they're 26th in line.  So in theory, at 5:00 we're in the first seating.  And so it happens, the publicly-underwritten public transit arrives (my one-way trip cost $1.25, my gf's unvalidated parking fee was $12) and two Hop Knots later, we're sitting down and waiting.  Typical order, one of everything, two Biancoverdes.  At this point being almost review #200, the details are irrelevant.  The crust is great, the cheese is great, the Sonny Boy is uber-salty and delicious, fruity olive oil, holy shit these roasted peppers, etc.  Why is that person staring at me through the window?So I guess the point is, if you make it your only point to go to Bianco, it's hard to be disappointed.~~#~1
I'm always on the lookout for a morning coffee place  and decided to stop at the Coffee Bean. Since I am always interested in trying new places, it looked inviting and clean, and was close to where I was going.They had the usual items you find in a coffee shop, and there was ample seating, with outside tables. That said, it wasn't anything out of the ordinary. However, if I am in the area, and need coffee to drink while reading my newspaper, this is a good option.~~#~0
Dr. Greg Allen is the best doctor in the East Valley and probably the state! He has the best of bed side manners and is caring in his listening to the patient's needs. We have used him for several years and trust him completely.~~#~1
INCREDIBLE food, relaxed/great atmosphere, perfect to bring kids/family...the cheeseburger, shredded bbq pork sandwich, sweet potatoes- too die for! Must try! Worth the drive!~~#~1
GET. THE. CIDER. Just do it. I'm a huge cider fan and this is the best I've ever had. Not syrupy sweet, and nice and cloudy so you know that it's been brewed from actual fruit and not some secret sugar concoction. Their master brewer also brews all of their sodas. Grab a taster for the sodas and see which one you like best. My favorite is the vanilla. The staff is ridiculously friendly and willing to answer any questions you have and will have a nice chat with you if they're not busy. The sandwiches are quite tasty as well. I've had the Mario's Monster Mill-wich, and my boyfriend has had the tuna and the French dip. All have been really good, but if you don't like a lot of feta on your sandwich I would suggest letting them know because they really pile it on (Mario's)! I love it so it was no problem for me.~~#~1
I got the best KEEN hiking boots on sale here and they have a great selection of dog frisbee and dog boots and dog toys. I like this location, nobody bothers me and I can mill around without anyone bothering me.~~#~1
No offense to everyone who gave this place 5 stars, but the Tempe Cinema staff needs a swift kick in the ass. During school hours, this place is regularly crawling with hooligan truants. Maybe those who run this theatre want to ensure they will have a steady stream of staffing options from the dropouts who use it as a hideout. Losers.~~#~1
Everything here is awesome! I love the Kung Pao shrimp and the Hong Kong soup which has wontons and and egg noodles they make in house. The soup they bring out before your meal is delicious as well. Everything tastes made to order, always fresh never greasy, and is presented beautifully. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Definitely try this place! It's a regular lunch spot for my office. They also have great lunch specials. :)~~#~1
They have anything from salads, pitas, wraps, burgers, and wood fired pizzas.  Although this isn't a 100% plant-based restaurant they pride themselves on having many vegan options.  Not only are there options, but upon visiting their site I found a table of what items are vegan, what aren't, and what makes them non-vegan (which is always nice to know). Great to have so many vegan options that are spelled out on their website.  We expected a counter-service experience but were pleasantly surprised when we entered to find it was an actual sit-down restaurant.  The vibe was a classy yet laid back, youthful feel.  Most of the servers were high school or college age and wore regular street clothes (think Urban Outfitters style).  I loved the laid back atmosphere of the servers even though it's a sit-down experience and really enjoyed the color scheme and tin plated ceiling.The food was absolutely FANTASTIC.  Oh my. For an appetizer we selected the garlic dip with two pitas.  The garlic dip is a mix of olive oil, lemon juice, fresh garlic, and smashed potatoes.  If you love garlic, you'll love this.My husband chose the Falafel Pita which was topped with cilantro and spices, mixed greens, tomatoes, onions, pickles and tahini.  He was very happy with his choice, although next time he'd ask for no onions.I went with the Veggie Garden Wrap that included zucchini, broccoli, cauliflower, eggplant, yellow squash, carrots, onions, tomatoes, brown rice, mixed beans, ginger, herbs and garlic.One thing we quickly found was that our entrees were HUGE.  This is not a complaint in anyway.  However, next go around we may share an entree.  Either way, this visit, we had leftovers to take home for lunch the next day. Will definitely return.~~#~1
Sorry, I really just don't get it. I didn't hate it and I'm not hating on it now, but I don't see what all the fuss is about.* Pizzas slapped together resulting in uneven, soggy crusts. Our party ordered 5 of the 6 available.* Psychological warfare of having to wait forever for just a few tables maintains an air of pompous superiority that tricks the famished patrons into reporting the pizza is a lot better than it really is. Waiter actually boasted about the 3 to 4 hour Saturday night wait, which we got around by having reservations!* Bottles of iced tea and other drinks bought in bulk rather than any alternative that would make more sense.Good? Not bad... Best in the Phoenix Valley? HIGHLY debatable, but personally I really can't say that I think so... Best is the USA? Impossible, there's just no way.LGO is better. Cibo is better. Spinato's is better.Most hyped? Most definitely.~~#~0
NO BETTER BREAKFAST IN AZ. From scrambled eggs to their blueberry pancakes. Top end. Yes, you pay for it. But it's special, like Valentines Day. Just pay out and enjoy the treat. Lunch is also nice, especially if you get a seat outside so you can people watch. Great wraps and sandwiches. Haven't tried anything later here yet. But I saw their happy hour specials and it is on my TO DO list.~~#~1
Great tasting frozen yogurt, excellent customer service, very clean inside. Healthy choice for a sweet treat.~~#~1
If you are looking for top-notch produce and organic goodies then NGD is the best. Pricing can't be beat and it's delivered as well. Always great quality, and a large selection. Easy ordering process and awesome customer service. One of the reasons I am sad not to live in Scottsdale anymore.~~#~1
I was really excited to try this restaurant, and tonight my husband and I came and ordered food to take-out. The service was very friendly and the store was clean, cute, and colorful...but the food was very disappointing. My husband ordered the curry chicken, and although it tasted okay, he literally almost choked on tiny bones in the meat 4 or 5 times. I asked ahead of time if they used white meat and was told yes, but the "Calypso Pasta" I ordered had tiny, tiny pieces of dark meat jerk chicken...instead of the boneless white strips I was expecting, and really it was just mediocre. I'm bummed I wanted to like this place.~~#~1
I was watching a Judge Judy show today and JJ was really giving the business to this loser (you know...had bad credit, met a chick, she took a credit card in her name, he didn't pay her back, she's shocked, now they're in court)...she was RIDING his ass. It was awesome. Finally she said "what planet are you from?"...Dude with mullet bows his head, darts his eyes from JJ and says "Why, I'm from Wisconsin Judge Judy".LMAO!Culver's, by way of the Dairy State, has settled on Camelback and Central. Rickie and I ate here after seeing Date Night on our "date night". Thought it was a cute, innocent, 1950s way to wrap up our afternoon. You know, kinda like Richie and Laurie Beth. Please, I need to check ID's on this reference. I'm sure Rickie wouldn't pass this one!Culver's was very clean with well trained and polite employees...think In N Out. We ordered the famous Butter Burgers along with various sides. Burgers. Yum! Sides. Ugh! Would rather have had Ore Ida. Cheese curds had a thick, icky overcooked batter with a Q tip sized cheese curd, fries were limp and sad (kind of like Jesse James career and life now) and the chicken tenders were standard fast food fare.Root Beer! Outstanding! Smoothie was OK...probably should have went with a good old fashion malt. But who knew?We had a fabulous booth across from a large open window with a fantastic Sunday breeze cooling our curds. I would go back for a burger and root beer. I might even wear a Packers or Brewers t shirt...just to see if I get some free stuff.~~#~0
I can't say enough good things about this place. Quick disclosure: When I was working for the Downtown YMCA, I discovered Local Breeze as I was searching for businesses to participate in our fund-raising campaign. Local Breeze was totally down to contribute. So on top of getting that delicious meal, know that your money is largely going back to the community. Awesome.But the food (and drinks) are really what keep me coming back. The coca-cola ham is delish, and the serving sizes are pretty decent. You definitely get your money's worth. And there's a reason why my profile says that my "recent discovery" is "spiced cottage cheese from Local Breeze." That was written months ago, but I don't think I've discovered anything quite as amazing yet. And I normally don't even like cottage cheese.The last time I went was for my bday dinner, and again, it didn't let me down. We had good food, good drinks, and a good time in general. The bartender mixed up this killer cucumber martini, which sounds weird, but if you're a martini fan, go for it. If you're feeling less risky, you can't go wrong with their mojito.~~#~1
This place is literally within walking distance from my apartment, yet I have passed by it daily. This morning I was hungry for breakfast and had a lot of things to do so I thought I would try something close. I have noticed the parking lot is usually full, so I thought it must be good. I had no idea what type of food they had or what to expect.It was Sunday morning just around 9:30 and I was fortunate to be able to walk in and instantly have a table. The server was very friendly and she checked back often always refilling my coffee. The menu is a little newspaper and it's a bit overwhelming with many options, but I finally settled on the volcano. It is described as three pancakes, 2 sausage links, 2 bacon strips, and an egg. The pancakes are three different sizes and stacked to create a volcano with the egg on top. It was under $9 and I was surprised at the size of it! I attempted but could not finish it. The big pancake was left uneaten. They do have a smaller option for around $6 and that might be the better way to go unless you have just returned from a month long trip through the jungle or plan to share with someone. The server continued to check on me and even offered up a to go cup of coffee. I don't know how I have overlooked this place but based on the experience today, I would put it right at the top of best spots in town for breakfast. I will say come early because by the time I was leaving the lobby was full, people were milling around the parking lot, and the wait to be seated was 15 minutes.~~#~1
Chino is a cool place to take someone who has never been there before.  It's strange and fascinating.  I live fairly close by and the food is fine, but it certainly doesn't blow your mind.  It's the kind of place that I get that Chino craving then I don't need to go for another 6 months or a year.  The snickerdoodles are great and come with the meal.  Expect to pay close to $10 a person if you get a drink with your meal.~~#~0
I personally love the other crackers so much more. I think it's the better customer service I'm never really impressed with the services here. It's either okay or a little below expectation something always happens when I come here. Something is forgotten or the wait is ridiculous just for the check to be picked up to be paid for or something. I can never tell you because it always changes.  Food wise...good. this last visit the French toast was NOT as amazing as it usually is. So kind of bummed about that. And my skillet I must have ordered the wrong thing because I usually just get the skillet with carnitas eggs and potatoes this time their was chorizo in it so it made my potatoes soggy:(  those things are another reason for dropped stars and also because I dont care for Chorizo and all its oils. For food and service to be off is unusual. But it happened so i always remember if you want the best you have to go to the best and this place is not it. Go to the one in mesa behind Home depot and beside Holiday Inn!~~#~0
So perfect. The atmosphere is just spot on. I love going whether it's just to grab coffee and leave or if I am there studying or just want to chill. I love their Apple Harvest (?) salad. So delicious and beautifully prepared. Baristas are always very nice (especially Brianna!). Can't wait to hopefully become a regular and attend some of the live music events they put on every week!!~~#~1
For the price, Xona is a clean, beautiful spot in North Scottsdale adjacent to the upscale Princess Resort. Place was virtually empty during our recent two-day stay, so we had a tranquil pool all to ourselves. Unlike some of the other reviewers, we received great service from the staff. Food from the onsite restaurant was tasty and convenient. Surrounding area safe for walking or jogging. We stayed in a king suite...comfortable and roomy. Thought this place was a bargain.~~#~0
Breadfruit is a cool spot. The interior of the place is well decorated and they can only seat about 15-20 people, making a nice, intimate ambiance. I really appreciate that they serve locally grown organic produce and that their chicken is all natural and raised cage free. Any addition of a Jamaican restaurant down town earns at least three stars in my book. We arrived at 7:30pm and were the only people there throughout almost the entire meal..We brought our own bottle of wine and there was only a $5 corking fee, not to shabby.We started with the plantain and avacado spring rolls, I really liked that wonton was baked and not deep fried, the presentation was nice, the mango chutney was fresh but the rolls themselves lacked flavor. I really wished they would have paired some other fruit or spice to add more contrast to the dish. For my main I got the jerk chicken and I was a little disappointed. Again they did an excellent job with the presentation, but the corn was mushy and what the jerk rub lacked in flavor they tried to make up for in spice.  I like spicy, and can handle a lot of heat, but heat shouldn't overpower flavor...The chef/owner came out and asked us how we enjoyed our meal, and explained his philosophy behind the food. The service was excellent, but in comparison to some other Jamaican places I've been, it really only warrants 3 stars (sorry)!~~#~0
Excellent customer service, super clean, and the food's not bad at all.  Despite the fact that I asked for extra mayo on my sammy, but got NO mayo, was a little annoying.  But, for some reason, something told me to pick up some packets of mayo.  So I was in the clear and my annoyance never gained traction into anything that prevented me from returning.  That, and the sandwich was pretty yummo.  They also give a pickle and a free bag of chips to go with it.I do not, however, recommend the chocolate chip cookie.  No bueno.~~#~1
From my door, it's a five minute stroll through the greenbelt to Dukes. They have a nice patio. They have enough TVs to show all MLB/NFL/NBA games. They have plenty of shuffleboard and pool tables. Yet, I've only been to Duke's a few times and I am not going back. This place is just bad.Mixed drinks are poured short and use cheap mixers (such as bottled sour mix for margaritas). They offer a pretty basic beer selection. I think PBR pitchers might be more modestly priced, but that might be only when they're on "special."The food is pretty bad, even for bar food. And pricey. Sure, the menu is gigantic and I've tried many different items, but I didn't find anything good. Everything seems to be made from "freezer to fryer" or packaged products. I'm not exaggerating: the burger and fries for about $8 is a thin, previously frozen patty with a handful or supermarket fries. I could go on about salads, sandwiches, and ribs. In the same price range, you can get a much better version of anything on the menu at Four Peaks or Zipps or even Devil's Advocate.One of the owners was there on a few occasions. I guess being the boss of (and drinking in) his own bar is some sort of dream of his. He treats the place like his kingdom. He'll ask patrons "how is everything?" and get mad at them if they have anything negative to say. I feel bad for the rest of the service staff; they seem to be above average, but when the overall situation is this bad it just doesn't matter.In this city, sports bars are a dime a dozen. I'd rather go elsewhere.~~#~1
Wow?!  Is this the new Barcelona?!  Yuck!  Old scuzy men and middle aged women with fake boobs that are falling out of their painted on dresses.  All bars were completely under staffed on a Friday night.  We waited 7 minutes at the front bar until being ignored continuously and we became so frustrated that we made our way to the round bar and it seemed just as understaffed.  What's the point of only having a few bartenders on probably the busiest night of the week for bar-goers?  We even approached the blond manager to ask for service and she was completely rude and had a total lack of desire to help us.  We will NOT return due to the lack of service and efficiency.  This place has GOT to staff more bartenders and needs much more help.  Welcome to North Scottsdale Barcelona.~~#~1
My goodness this place has gone downhill. Yeesh.~~#~0
I traveled to Phoenix often for work from the early 90's to the late 00's and the first thing I'd do leaving the airport was to hit the Pink Pepper lunch buffet, hence I've never ordered from the menu or had their dinner service, but their lunch buffet was awesome!  Very reasonably priced, including an iced tea.  It may not necessarily be the most authentic Thai food as I think they reduce the heat a bit but the flavors were excellent and the variety was good.  Loved their eggplant dish (can't recall the name) and their crispy chicken with the creamy sauce, and of course the usual curry sauce dishes.If I'm ever back in Phoenix again the Pink Pepper will be one of the first places I go.~~#~1
I feel bad for this park. Its nice. Really nice. The only problem is its in Phoenix where it is hot like heck. That means the roof is always closed. And with the roof closed, it almost feels like you are watching baseball inside of an auditorium.~~#~0
OK, being from Wisconsin (the land of the "great lakes") I was COMPLETELY surprised to be told that, yes, there are lakes here in the desert of Arizona.  The Lake, Saguaro Lake, is a man made lake originally built as Stewart Mountain Dam...even so, its beauty is equal to those you would see in the glacier regions of the Midwest.  I was amazed, frankly, at how beautiful this tour was.  Sold for $18 for 90 minutes, you get your money's worth.  But that is probably not what you want to hear...The "event" is a combination of 1) the scenery, and also 2) the charm of the paddle boat itself.  The boat is quite large with seating for probably close to 75 people!  It's an event that you could share with family, but I happened to be there with friends.  Currently, it's a pretty mellow type of event (great for Mother's Day!), although I am told that they are hoping to exploit its benefits to include comedy shows, Jazz ensembles, stargazing, and a variety of other events.P.S.  They also advertise that you can rent the paddle boat for company picnics, weddings, and the like.~~#~1
So, what kind of place serves chicken fingers and NO Ranch dressing?????? The only sauces they had was honey mustard and "Canes Secret sauce" Can I say EEWWWW!! I thought that the sauce tasted terrible. I am not too big a fan of honey mustard but I do On occasion eat it if there is nothing else And that wasn't even good! The coleslaw was awful also. I do have to say that the chicken fingers were very juicy but also very bland. Those were the only 2 items that I tried, not that there were really any more items  on the menu, Texas toast? And Fries I think?? Overall, I would never go back.~~#~1
Had the pastrami sandwich. It brought me back memories of living in NYC and eating that first pastrami. It was good.  Good food hAs the power of time travel. This is a great place. Plus the coke is primo. Good mixture. The ice makes it over the top.~~#~1
I hadn't been to Fuddruckers for about 20 years... now I know why.  Cashier was nice and very helpful.  I ordered bacon cheese burger combo.  Fries were only warm, not hot.  Burger was not very tasty and it was full of gristle bits... you know the ones that stick between your teeth.  Lots of trash on the floor.  After we were finished, someone came to ask how things were.  I told here about the fries and she offered to get me more; I declined.  She offered a free dessert: I accepted.  In all, not a good experience, will probably be at least another 20 years before I go back.~~#~1
Eden's Grill has to be one of my favorite, and newly discovered Middle Eastern/Mediterranean restaurant in the PHX metro. Located in a sleepy strip mall, close to Artie's Ace, is EG. My partner and I had the opportunity to have dinner here a few weeks ago and we were totally wowed by everything! We started off with the hummus, followed by two orders of the vegetarian plate. The vegetarian plates were huge and featured dolmades, falafel, rice, veggie skewers and veggie patties (2). The vegetarian plate was massive and everything on the plate was delicious. Next time we'll pay the extra $5 and split one Vegetarian Plate instead of getting two. The pita and hummus were fresh and delicious, however, I find EG's hummus to be a a little thick for my preference and they use a heavy dose of tahini in their hummus. Overall, I would totally recommend EG to anyone with an itch for Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food but be warned, they aren't open for lunch on the weekends yet.~~#~1
I only did layovers in this airport to and from Colorado from California, but I liked it. There were a ton of places to eat which was fantastic. Their flights left on time, which was kinda annoying when we got in 10 minutes late and ended up getting stuck there for almost 3 hours. Free internet access helped with that though. It's an airport I don't mind being stuck in for a bit.~~#~0
Tailgating here is something else altogether, but if you are doing ANYTHING near ASU, then you already know about the party scene. Let us get to the stadium proper... This place is huge. Standing down on the field and looking up towards that blue Arizona sky will give you a little perspective on just how massive this place is. Sandwiched between two mountains, it's easy to get lost in your surroundings. The only bone I have to pick is with the fact the bathrooms are like finding water in the desert. I was expecting a stadium of this size to have numerous bathrooms, but I had to do more then a little searching to locate one. If you are looking to catch a college football game and get the "big stadium" experience, Sun Devil Stadium is a pretty good place to start.~~#~0
Consistent is a great word to describe this place. The food is consistently great; the service is consistently great; the regulars are consistently there. (they're great too). It has a comfortable smoking/drinking patio and great prices during happy hour. The staff and owner is always (consistently) accommodating and friendly. You feel like you are part of the family here. Food I'd recommend: Any fish served Greek style, the Prime Rib, the burgers and definitely the fillet medallions with the gorgonzola wine sauce. All the food is good though and you gotta love the salad bar!~~#~1
How have I gone this long without reviewing the lodge? Sheesh! I get all fluttery inside when I think about the lodge. The Mac and Cheese is not something to play around with. It is a dish of fantastic, cheesy wonderfulness. Also, please note the veggie wrap. HOLY SMOKES. Its a heavenly combo of sauteed veggies, feta cheese, and some kind of lemon/herb/heaven sauce all wrapped up in a pita! Really? Really Aaron May?The other aspects of the lodge I enjoy involve the friendly staff, and comfortable setting. It's decorated all rustic and cushy, and true to form there are antler-chandeliers. You will also find pool tables, darts, several TV's, jenga, bean bag games...they have plenty going on at the lodge to keep you and your friends entertained. Check it out...~~#~1
Just went for my first time last night with "the "girls". Two of us heard about it and after I read the reviews and checked out the menu it was slated for our next night out.Anyway we had a memorable evening with wine, the make-your-own cheeseboard and the to-die-for pear and gorganzola flatbread pizza. It was topped with fried sage leaves -- different and delicious. Afterward we were able to fit dessert and shared a huge slice of fresh layer cake filled and frosted with dark chocolate. Sublime! Can't wait to go back and try other dishes - definitely made it to my 'Restaurants to Frequent' list :)~~#~1
I really enjoyed my mani/pedi with Trisha!  She took her time and taught me about manicuring my nails from home which I loved.I went in for the Groupon basic mani/pedi deal and left feeling like I got a lot more! It was the most pleasant experience I've had at a nail salon. The conversation was easy and Trish is a great person. I will be coming back to Trish for nails again! The entire staff was friendly and professional. Great Salon!!~~#~1
Mister Softee is an all-star, he showed up on time, provided great service, and has great tasting ice cream... Give him a call !!~~#~1
Awesome food anyone??? Go check out Modern Steak in Scottsdale, AZ.Gorgeous dining room! Excellent service (with our server Gabe)! And the food was AAAMMMAZZING!It's located at Fashion Mall, but it's NOT a "mall" restaurant. A MUST go!~~#~1
Dude...a happy hour that is TRULY happy!!!  This joint is relatively swank for all the deals it has.  Nice decor, good bar, FRESH seafood (seriously...this is some good quality).  Starting at 4:00 p.m., they have $5 martinis AND $0.75 oysters.  YUM!On top of that, they offer discounts on other appetizers such as the bread and cheese plate, a GIANT crab cake, a salads, and shrimp dishes.  All are tasty.For all the Zoners out there (yeah, I said it), you have to check out this place.  You will have a great time! NOTE - beware of dirty old men.  They'll hit on your friends!~~#~1
So my friend and I stumbled upon this place on our way to Barb's bakery but WOW I have never had a better taco in my life. The carne asada street tacos are freaking amazing. They also have the bottled cokes from mexico that for some reason taste sweeter than cokes bottled here. The waitress was also extremely friendly when we were checking out we asked how to pronounce the name of the restaurant and she started teaching us some Spanish.~~#~1
I can now thank the Humane Society for not only giving me my dog Brutus when I was a child, but now my dog Harley as an adult. A couple of years ago, I planned a visit to the Arizona Humane Society to present them with a corporate donation on behalf of my old company. When I scheduled the meeting, they offered to give me a tour of the vicinity and as a friend of the helpless animals, I said of course and planned my visit. However, I knew that with a tour, I might be in some trouble in the willpower department. When I arrived to the center, I was greeted by a pretty view of South Mountain and a wide open vicinity. I walked inside and immediately noted how clean it was for being home to many a furry creature. The staff was warm and welcoming as potential new "parents" waited in the lobby to adopt a new friend. Kittens and bunnies greeted the guests and there was a special area for the cats being featured that week. The vicinity was a five star facility to say the least and I could immediately tell that the animals were treated well here and in good hands until they found a new home. To make a long story shorter, they gave us a detailed tour of the complex. I walked through spacious room after spacious room full of dogs of all kinds just wanting a home. As I walked up to one of the cages, a furry ball of fluff looked up at me and placed his paw on the cage. I fell in love immediately. To make matters worse, the staff then took us into a room where we could make a kong of peanut butter and treats for our dog of choice. Of course I had to give it to my new found friend. At that point I knew I was in trouble and could very well be leaving with a dog. So to end that part of my story, I did leave with a dog and Harley has been happy in his new home ever sense. While I visited the Humane Society, I couldn't get over their quality of service for not only the clients but the animals themselves. They were clean, kept in spacious areas and they even had a huge playground for the animals to play in each and every day. When i found Harley and started to think about taking him home with me, they took me to a private play area where I could get to know Harley a bit more to make sure he was the right dog for me. A staffer stayed in the area and helped me with any questions I had. When I made the decision to take Harley home with me, they neutered him, gave me a couple free vet visits and sent me home with some treats, food and a leash. They even have a pet store to pick up all your essentials for your new friend. And did I mention that the proceeds go back to the Humane Society...a nonprofit? This Arizona Humane Society is a five star pet resort that focuses on making the most of a pet's stay until they find a new home. I suggest just taking a visit to the facility to see how well-kept it is. They even have horses that they rescued. Sorry folks, they are not up for adoption though. So thank you Arizona Humane Society for bringing my little dog Harley to me and saving so many animals from the streets.~~#~1
Awesome, awesome, awesome....everything was fantastic. The innovative drink menu, the pizza was out of this world and the bartender was very personable. A++ I would definitely recommend this place to everyone. Ban't wait to return!~~#~1
This place confounds me...They have an excellent beer and wine selection. As a matter of fact, their beer selection is one of the best I've seen in AZ. Tons of micro-beers and many different and unique bottles of rare Euro- brau. For the selection, to stop by and pick something up and go, this place is great. As a restaurant/Wine Bar bar, I give this place a big...Meh.The service was terrible. Of the party of 6, everyone that ordered a glass of wine, only got one. They sat with their glasses empty for at least 30 minutes. Those of us drinking beer, just walked over to cooler and grabbed a beer. We also had an appetizer. We got the warm pretzels with gourmet mustard. It was frozen pretzels they microwaved with Honey mustard. They were still cool in the middle and a little stale. Maybe it was just an off night or something, I'll probably give it another shot.~~#~0
Hole-in-the-Rock is a cave-like natural rock formation sculpted into the top of a sandstone butte in Phoenix's beautiful Papago Park. It's one of the most powerful scenic views in our city, and is the perfect place to showcase its exquisite landscape. Just a short hike up the butte and you'll find yourself in the amazing chamber sculpted over millions of years of wind and water erosion. At sunset there are few locations that can rival its awesomeness. The hole faces south, giving a wonderful view over south Phoenix all the way to South Mountain.  Hole-in-the-Rock is truly one of the greatest attractions in our city and everyone would be blessed to experience it at least once. No fee to enter. Bring a camera!~~#~1
I may have to disagree with the majority of reviews of this restaurant. We came here after my parents played a round of golf. With their round they got two free steak dinner, which they raved about... not sure if it was more on the fact that they were tasty or that they were free, which today can be just as exciting. I ordered the Coconut Shrimp with Sweet Potato Fries, and although this is a large plate of fried concoctions, it was delicious! I could not ask for a more crispy, summer-y meal. There were some problems with the service, we had a dirty glass and a bad glass of wine. But they were very helpful in recognizing their fault and fixing the problem. There was karaoke playing the night we were there, which was interesting, but not the creme of the crop participants if you catch my drift. So if you are a  golfer and looking for a great place to go after your round, stop by.~~#~0
Flatiron Mesa is one of my favorite hikes in the Phoenix area. Like other reviewers have stated, once you've gotten used to Squaw and Camelback, give this one a try.  It'll kick your ass.  It's about a 2600' climb in elevation, so you're doing more like 2.5 Camelbacks. You'll be scrambling over boulders most of the way up since there really aren't switchbacks. I'd say give yourself about 5 hours to go up and down.  It's inside Lost Dutchman State Park so you will need to pay an entry fee.My one recommendation besides the obvious ones (being fit, pack food and water) is to bring some light gloves.  Since you're climbing up and down on all those boulders your hands will probably get a little scratched up.Don't feed the wildlife.~~#~1
I've been going to Lake Pleasant Dentistry for 2-3 years now and Dr. Sharon Bader is hands-down the best dentist I've ever had.  I've traditionally had bad experiences with dentists and am always wary of any dental procedure, but I've never felt more comfortable than with Dr. Bader.She is very accommodating, puts you at ease, explains all the options and does GREAT work and will stand behind it.  She did a pretty complex crown for me when the tooth was borderline whether it could be saved and it worked out great.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this practice to anyone.~~#~1
What happened to this place?  The food was good and seemed to have passionate folks who worked there.What a shame!  I think many were only just discovering it.~~#~1
Pleasant, courteous,  low prices and your clothes are ready the next day! What more could you ask for!~~#~1
It's pretty awesome here!  I was traveling in Phoenix for work and had to get my raw food fix (I eat a raw diet at home and as much as I can while traveling) and this was excellent!  The portions were large and the price was good.  The same type of food in places like Chicago are much more expensive.  I got the raw taco's for lunch and the blueberry fields salad to-go.  They were both great!  I also had an appetizer but that ended up being too much food so I packed it, too.  The location is actually fairly close to the airport (10 min drive) and so it will be my preferred place to go when I'm in Phoenix.~~#~1
Went here for the first time a few weeks ago and it was some of the best BBQ I've had in Arizona. The service was great as well! The manager stopped by a few times as well as our waiter to make sure everything was good.*****UPDATE***** Looks like they went out of business. Haven't been open for two weeks now.....~~#~1
I went in at 8 on a Thursday night, and the place was pretty empty except for a family of 4 eating.  The layout is a little strange, it looks like you should order at the big window with the kitchen behind it, but you actually order in the back right corner of the restaurant.  The girl who took my order was very friendly and made my fat ass feel welcome there, which is pretty rare these days.  She suggested I do the slider plate, which I did with a side of green chili mac and cheese and cornbread.  It took about 10 minutes for my order to come out, which is probably a good sign that they were at least spending some time cooking something back there.  The sliders were awesome, all the meat was very moist and full of smoky flavor, my favorite out of the three was definitely the pulled pork.  The green chili mac and cheese was also very good, which was somewhat surprising to me.  I was expecting Stouffer's with pickled jalapenos stirred in, but it was far from that.  For being the end of the night, it was very fresh and cheesy.  The only part of the meal that wasn't great was the cornbread, but I don't think you can really do much to cornbread to make it wow you anyway.  I definitely like this better than Honey Bears, and it doesn't even compare to the BBQ joke Famous Dave's.  When I have tailgate this year, Andrew's will definitely be my go to place for everything.  Also, my meal only ran me about $8.50 and it was very filling and worth every penny.~~#~1
Service is always great, and the waiters are plesant and nice to have serve you.  This is one of my favorite breweries to come too.  They have a good selection of beer that is made in house, and you can also get a growler of any type to take home (or home made root beer, which is also amazing)  I have never had anything less than a great meal in the around 60 times I have ate here.~~#~1
Everything about this company sucks. Walmart treats their customers and employees horribly, I mean HORRIBLY! They destroy the communities in which they sit. I'm done, never shopping here again, I don't care how cheap something might be, there is a high cost to low prices afterall...~~#~1
Someone already commented on the large Cow mural, I was not going to because it might just be me, but I have heard a few comments about it now. Yea, really odd choice, and kind of uncomfortable to be eating a burger and having Elsa the Cow, with very sad eyes, staring at you while your biting into one of her relatives. Other then that, I feel that they did a good job on the decor. Really nice in fact. Now I ordered the Zin Burger, and it was very good. I mean as I was eating it, it was as good as any burger that I have had. As good as Gallo Blanco, and Hula's. Very juicy, flavorful, I liked the bun. It was a 5 star until I stopped eating it. Yep, then it lost a star. How? After I was done, my mouth turned into the Salton Sea. Holy crap, easy on the sodium chef!!! Way too much salt. Now I know what salt does, but overkill. I actually tasted salt for the next hour.  You had me with everything else, just don' t want to feel that I just sucked on a pretzel. Only other complaint is the pricing. Like everyone else on here, I think the pricing is all wrong. Especially if your going solo. I mean as a single diner I have to order a basket of fries? I thought Delux was stupid for doing so, why make the same bad move. I also saw most people sharing a burger. If thats not a sign, when customers have to get creative on how to eat at your place without breaking the bank, take a good hard look at how you might make your customers more happy. Look at it this way Fox team.             Zin Burger                                  10.00             Basket fries                                   5.00             Draft Beer                                      5.50             Second draft beer because              my mouth is a salt shaker        5.50             Desert (are you kidding, I'm             out of money).                                                                                    25.50                                                         tax      2.25                                                     Total    27.75    Wow, I am back in NYC at these prices!!!~~#~0
Jack in the Box, this one in particular, is busiest from 10pm-2am. It definitely a "better when your drunk" kind of place, or at least I think it is from the number of drunk patrons I see eating there. The food? Well, it's JitB, what do you expect? You got the 99 cent for 2 tacos deal, which is a must add for any meal. You also have breakfast served all day. This means you can get a Extreme Sausage Sandwhich, 2 Tacos, and a Chicken Fajita Pita in the same meal. That's some good eatin'. Please note that nothing about the Chicken Fajita Pita is remotely close to an actual fajita. This location specializes in making your food NOT look like it does in the picture. The picture may show a big fluffy bun with a juicy burger, however your burger will probably look like someone stepped on it then ran it over with their car. It doesn't change the taste, tho. Still tastes exactly like you would expect something to taste from JitB. I mean, it's good food and a good value. By "good" food, I of course mean greasy and unhealthy. That is the definition of good food though, right?~~#~0
Great little restaurant.  The staff is super friendly, and their happy hour specials are pretty amazing.  I got thePanko crusted Tipalia which was a little dry, but my girlfriend's stuffed mahi mahi was delicious.  The Horchata bread pudding was really good too.  They have a nice patio where most of the customers sit, I will be bringing my dog with me next time.  It is a bit expensive, so be prepared to drop some money, but it's definitely worth checking out.~~#~1
The best bar in town.~~#~1
I' m psycho for this place.  The sell cupcakes now! (Ollie Cake)  and have longer hours of operations I believe ( I want to say until 7?)  NOM NOM NOM.~~#~1
Ordered spanikopita and Greek salad. Spanny was doughy and Greek salad lacked a kick. Unlike any Greek I'd had before. Not going back.~~#~0
Lived in house for 9 years and just thought was time to replace the carpeting, had used some of those "$99 room" services over the years for routine cleaning, met Ray Odom, Owner of Hydro-Pro, and gave them a crack at cleaning the carpets before I replaced them. I was Amazed at results, by the time they were done the carpets looked brand new, took their time and did incredibally throrugh job.  Great service at reasonable price-well worth it. My carpet cleaner from now on.~~#~1
Let me start by saying that I love tacos. I eat lots of tacos. When I get hungry one of the first things to cross my mind is tacos. That said, I love El Nopalito for their tacos. I'm pretty picky about my tacos. I don't really like dumb-ass flour tortillas, dry tacos, unseasoned meat in a taco, taco bell is not tacos, the list goes on. I prefer authentic Mexican street tacos.That being said, El Nopalito is the one place in town I feel like I am getting the most authentic street taco that I have been able to find in Phoenix. The only reason I am not here more often is the commute is a bit much as I live in the East Valley.  However, if I am anywhere near the area it is almost mandatory to stop and have at least a taco or two. I recommend trying all of the tacos though my favourite has to be the cabeza (it sounds creepy but is buttery and delicious).It does help if you speak Spanish as it will make ordering and asking any questions you may have easier.~~#~1
I tried a few different kinds of pizza and they were all okay.  A few people had told me that they made "incredible" pizzas, but I didn't really think so...I'd say they were pretty good pizzas.  What I liked were the fresh tasting vegetables which topped some of the pizzas.  The cheese was a bit disappointing, especially since I don't think you can really go wrong with cheese...it just lacked flavor.All in all, I probably wouldn't go back...it just really wasn't all that impressive.~~#~0
Visited recently for the first time.  Enjoyed happy hour appetizers on the patio.  Cool place for outdoor dining, the waterfall added a nice background.  They offer smoking and non-smoking on separate sides of the patio.  Of course you know that if anyone is smoking, the entire area gets to "enjoy" the smoke.  Being a non-smoker, I would appreciate an true non-smoking area but being outdoors was too compelling to pass on this beautiful day.  Another small observation - the tables were too low for the chairs causing you to lean over to eat and the chairs were not comfortable at all.  We ordered chicken quesadilla & crab cake appetizer.  The quesadilla was made w/ green chiles and cheese, served w/ green & red salsa.  Didn't care for the red salsa but the green was pretty good, rather mild.  A side of sour cream was all that was missing here.  Crab cakes were ok, nothing special.  Served w/ a nice side salad it made a very good small meal.  A side of some kind of orange sauce (chipotle?) for the crab cakes that seemed really HOT to me - skip this next time please.Just based on the outdoor atmosphere alone, I would definitely come back again.~~#~0
Sometimes I really wish I could live in Scottsdale. I met up with two girlfriends there and we had a great time! This visit was a solid 3-4. We went in to take advantage of their happy hour (if you don't the prices seem wayyyy to steep for me). Anyway, if you take advantage of their happy hour you must sit either in the outside patio or the lounge. Now the outdoor patio was beautiful! Prettiest outdoor seating I have seen ever. But not when it is 104 out. (and there are no misters). Why did we sit outside do you ask? Because the bar area (which is tiny) filled up super fast (duh. its yummy!) The indoor ambiance is beautiful. (a little dark) The most awesome lights ever are in there. The service was good and the location is nice (right next to the free parking too!)I tried the featured white wine, and whatever it was (sorry I forgot) was good! My friend tried the sangria, but I was not a fan. Weird flavor compared to most sangrias that I can't describe. Now onto the food. People who raved about the flatbread pizzas...I have no idea what you are talking about.  I had the margharita and it was just not good. Soggy and flavorless. The hummus was very yummy. Needed more pita with it. Now onto the star of the show: the bruschetta. The vine ripe tomato is yummy. The apple caponata is just as yummier, and the prosciutto and fig was also excellent! Ohhhh so yummy! This is the place to get bruscetta and wine after a long day.~~#~0
This place is heavenly!!! I have dreams about it on a regular basis. The cookies are so fresh and you can choose two different kinds and two different ice cream flavors. TASTY!~~#~1
Yum best donuts in Phoenix.~~#~1
Alright we are going to say that this place is Awesome!  The service is outstanding and the food wonderful!    We came here for Breakfast on Sunday Morning .             They were very busy ,but, we did not have to wait too long at all.                                    Our server Colleen was great!   She greeted us right away and  brought our drinks very quickly.   The food was very good and just love their Potatoes.  The menu is fantastic! Lots to choose from. We like the decor and lots of parking in the lot. Nice Place and we will be back!~~#~1
This place is a gem. The food is amazing. It's cheap. The service is good. My favorite part? The place never changes. I can walk through the door and Ali already knows my order. The Chicken Shawarma special comes with their hand-made pita - so soft and delicious. The chicken is seasoned perfectly and comes with a yummy little dollop of garlic sauce. I've never found better hummus in my life. I've had it all around town, in New York, in L.A. (ick...L.A. *shudder*). SO good! The iced tea has a hint of rose water. OH and the gyro? Hands down, the best in town.Did I mention they have a market attached? Talk about the best price on spices in town! The spices come in little plastic sealed pillows, so get some spice jars from Ikea and stock up!I couldn't get through this without mentioning the lamb tongue. I am no connoisseur of organ meats, but this sandwich is like the most tender lamb you've ever had in your life. Shut up and try it.The only sad part about Haji's is that they close early. Usually 8pm on a week-night, but totally worth getting to-go orders if you can swing in on your way home from work!~~#~1
We decided to eat here on a whim. My husband got the burger brûlée and I got the beach house burger. Both were fantastic. The buns were perfect and we both agreed these were the best burgers we had had in a really long time. The sweet potato tater tots and French fries were also amazing. For $27 it fed our family of five. I'm definitely going back. Friendly service, casual atmosphere, and clean. Thumbs up all the way!~~#~1
We arrived on time however our table was not ready. Offered a place in the bar but was told we cannot order for 30 minutes?!Somewhat bizarre thing to be told. Had a total of eight dishes, some were fantastic, others mediocre. Despite  the fact that they are the hot new thing, a customer should never be told that they can't order for 30 minutes. That exudes arrogance. Cocktails pretty good. Might give them another chance.~~#~0
I have lived steps away from this place for years and a few months ago, my boyfriend suggested I give it a try. Since I'm very picky with mexican food places, I had doubts, but boy was I wrong! All I can say is wow!!! This place is amazingly delicious. I thought I would never find a place who served authentic Mexican tacos and out of the blue I found it in a hole in the wall strip mall and just steps from my house! This can be a good thing, but also a dangerous thing because I am trying to lose weight. This place is so good. I got two tacos and I know I will be going back again and again.~~#~1
A  bit surprised at the high prices but figured that the "trendy factor in old town" and the atmosphere was the reason because the teeny portions of the food and the quality is just GOOD, like the Good egg, not great, not bad, just good. No happy hour?And Too dark inside. Lots of pretty wait staff. My first suggestion would be to fire grill the mahi tacos and not batter them, they were not that flavorful. The side dishes of street corn and some potato chorizo thing were very good. I wanted to try the guac, but 12 bucks for an avacado with some garlic and cilantro? How about trying to make a good ceviche?My hubby and i thought that Rubios rocks in comparison, we love the shrimp tacos and the pablano and portobello tacos.~~#~0
Bad experience...Terrible service, terrible food.First of all, I was organizing a Happy Hour and Dinner for a retirement party that we had on Friday, August 3rd, 2012.  Reading the fine print on the website it did say that happy hour prices were in the bar area, although because it was a party of 30 we could not fit in that area.  One of the attendees called the restaurant and spoke with the Manager which he confirmed that we were going to have happy hour prices. It turns out when we got to the restaurant they thought we were another party for 40 people that booked the spot for happy hour, but the attendee that spoke with the Manager was misinformed and they only gave us one round of happy hour prices.Second of all, our server was awful.  There were a couple of servers that actually waited on us because there was a table of 10 people.  Anyways, she took wrong orders and did not listen to our needs and was rushed, rushed, rushed.  Then a new person came in late on our table, and she was not even served when she saw her.  We had to track her down. I am sorry but the amount of restaurants that I have been to, this was the worst service ever.  I mean I had servers that actually new who was new at the table and took their order once they arrived.I ordered full size of fried green tomatoes, 1/2 order of fried okra, and a plate of sweet potato fries.  The server gave me my fried green tomatoes, but gave me full size of fried okra and the sweet potato fries was horrible.  So I had the server take my sweet potato fries because it was awful.  The server took it away without even asking me if I wanted another batch. I don't cook much, but I probably can fry those tomatoes alot better than the restaurant. I told the server I ordered 1/2 size of fried okra, and she said ok and brought it back to the kitchen then she brought the same dish back and said that she will just charge me for the 1/2 size order.  And lastly, when the server gave us the bill, it was all separate checks and did not even do that right.  The server was putting stuff on the bill that did not even belong on the check.So needless to say...I AM NOT COMING BACK TO THIS RESTAURANT AGAIN.~~#~1
One of my favorite places to go with the kids for lunch.  Bring a small amount of $ - grab yourself a table under the trees and enjoy the afternoon away while your kids play within eyesight.  The entire "patio" is really a large, fenced grassy, tree filled area with 2 volleyball courts, multiple gathering areas, ping pong, horse shoes, jumbo checkers and even another fenced in area full of sand and toys for the kids.~~#~1
The banana pecan french toast was great - order a 1/2 order and split it with someone else for "breakfast desert"!Rest of the food was definitely better than ok, but dropped my review to 3 stars because restrooms weren't clean and had no hand soap -- where are employees washing their hands???~~#~0
Uh-oh. Where am I? The view from atop the mountain is superb. The city can be seen in all directions. Look, there's Downtown 1 and Downtown 2. And a bunch of houses under construction. And look at that sky. Wowza. Ok, so stopping to enjoy the view is one thing. Stopping to figure out where the hell you are is another. "Don't worry," I told my friend. "This city is laid out in a grid. If anything, we can walk down the other side of the mountain and cut back across on the street." Oh, little did I know. Let me give you the back story. I've been to South Mountain twice. The first time was Christmas Eve 2006 when hardly a soul could be found. I met a friend there and we blazed our own trail. He always had his jeep in sight, so no harm in getting turned around. I trusted him to be my guide. The second and last time I hiked South Mountain was in February. My best friend flew in to Phoenix for the weekend (for my birthday) and since the weather was so great (in comparison to Detroit), she wanted to be out in the sun as much as possible. No problem. I knew where we could go for a good hike. Little did I know we'd get lost. We parked at the 24th St. entrance and picked our path, the Mormon Trail. We were on our way to discovering religion, we joked, passing by several other hikers. When we reached a recognizable summit, we stopped to appreciate the view... and then ponder our location. Should we turn around and go back the way we came? Were we still on the Mormon Trail? Where were the markers, the loops, the signs from God? We looked at each other, each of us having a take-no-prisoners personality when it comes to conquering great piles of rock. "Onward!" we shouted, punching the air with our fists. A little while later, we were once again stopped, our eye squinting against the retiring sun. I wouldn't call us "lost," as this point in time, but that's only because I'm too stubborn to admit such an error. "Let's ask somebody," I suggested. So, the next hiker dude that passed by, we stopped to ask him, "Will this trail loop back around?" "Where do you want to go?" he asked. That's when I realized we had tied our tennis shoes tight only to march into a rocky labyrinth. I told him where we parked and he said it was a good 2 hour hike back to our car, yet about another mile or two to the 48th St. entrance. Oh, no problem, I thought, since the city was laid out like a grid. Little did I know there are exceptions to that. We pressed on, thanking our impromptu guide friend. We hiked and hiked and hiked, passing by fellow hikers and mountain bikers. Finally, the trail opened up to flat land. We were close, or so we thought. When we reached the end of the trail, there was no parking lot and no street connecting us to where we needed to go. Instead, there was a long gravel road that weaved itself through a golf course. W.T.F.We set out to walk the long gravel road until we hit Baseline, in which we were determined to cut back Westward and find my car, the only way we had of getting anywhere. The sun was setting. We had no time to waste. Having hiked about 15 miles already, our feet were heavy, like cinder blocks. But, we continued on. "Let's hitch a ride," I suggested. People were gathering in their wonderful Ford pick-up trucks and jeeps. Hikers are friendly, I thought; somebody was bound to accept our plea for help. We opted to just do this ourselves. That's when a car slowed down. "Ugh, creep," I thought. Instead, it was our helpful hiker friend from the summit. He asked if we needed a ride. My best friend and I exchanged glances. I thought, "We can take him." After a 70-second long pause, we accepted. She hopped in back and I rode shot gun, leaving my seat-belt off and the door unlocked, in case of a speedy getaway. We chit chatted on the drive down the road, which lead to another road, and then another and another, until we finally touched Baseline. Where the hell were we? That's when it hit us. We would have been walking another 7 miles on foot back to my car. All these windy, disjointed roads. Damn golf course. Damn South Mountain. Damn unmarked trails. It should change its name to the Moron Trail, for we just blazed it enthusiastically. The kind hiker man dropped us off at my car and drove away. With a sigh large enough to blanket the skyline, we unlocked my car, got inside and drove away - away from South Mountain, nature's beast and practical joker. We counted the miles and the minutes it would have taken us to get back to my car. Another hour, at least. The sun would have set by then and we would have missed our dinner engagement. Lucky for us, we stopped the right hiker friend at the right moment; otherwise, I may never have made it home to write this review.~~#~0
Love this place. Great Happy Hour.~~#~1
I ordered a cappuccino, my typical order at a new place and it was very good with a pretty heart design on top which made me smile. The espresso was perfect and did not require any sweetener. I also got a blueberry muffin which wasn't very good, perhaps it was low fat or something but I am very picky about pastries anyway. My biggest problem with this place is the fact that they do not have a bathroom. Coffee makes me have to pee and when I discovered this and had to walk all the way to the baby gap because the place next door with a bathroom wasn't open yet requiring me to pack up my computer and leave my drink and food unattended, it was a bit undesirable. I know it's a mall type area but it still surprised me for a drink/food place. It does not set the tone for a place to spend a lot of time which may be their intention. Also, I love John Mayer but they played his same songs over and over again. Perhaps mixing it up or putting on a pandora station would be better? The staff was nice and they have free WiFi. I will return for the espresso but get it to go.~~#~0
Nasty workers and over priced trash~~#~1
Dr. Jones was very friendly and understanding!~~#~1
Great library...take your canned food to donate all during APRIL and they wave off your fines- GREAT cause, GREAT deal and now fine free!~~#~1
Ok here goes.  I'll start with the bad and finish positive.  As far as Pizza goes, which is what we went for, I was not that impressed.  I must say I'm more of a NY style, by the slice pizza kind of guy.  So the pizza did not hit the spot.  Maybe a little too fancy for my palette. (You can take a boy out of the ghetto, but you can't take the ghetto out of the boy, so for me simple food is always better.)  Obviously, there are enough people who like gourmet pizza as this place has amazing reviews, so I'm just one simple man.The obnoxious fat chick sitting right behind me proclaimed to her friend, "I'm no longer investing time in men who aren't available!"  Put down the pizza and grab a dry salad and shut up!!  That's not really the restaurants fault though but I did have to endure that convo through the duration of my meal.Our server was very nice however seemed very rushed and at times we had to wait for refills on water and for the check.  The atmosphere is very romantic outside with light trees and live music.  They even turned on one of the heaters on the patio for the lil lady.  We has the Crepe with Nutella chocolate powdered sugar and ice cream and it was very very good.  Bottom line.  I'd be willing to come here again and try something other than pizza.~~#~0
I have been meaning to stop in but keep driving on by.  I am SO GLAD that I stopped. I was pleased the moment I walked in.  The store is well lit and cheery, the books line the wall making you feel like you're walking into a oasis of knowledge.  I found 10 copies of the book I was looking for (I needed 10 copies) and the owner said he will order me copies of two books he didn't have.  Also, he offered his community room for my book club!  So nice, very friendly, definitely the kind of place we want to encourage.~~#~1
The best gluten free pizza!! Absolutely loved the avacado pizza. So delicious. The wait staff was great, very friendly and invited us to a wine tasting while we waited.  Parking is limited, but certainly not an issue to complain about.~~#~1
The portions are too small, the plasticware just reminds me of Jack In The Box, the serving tray is right from a mall food court, and the menu selection is drastically reduced.  You can't really enjoy conversation or relax at lunch listening to the kitchen scream out order numbers to the customers.  The flavor mixing softdrink machine is fun, but gimmicky.  The food quality and flavor are the same for the most part, but you do leave wanting more...I won't be returning to this location.~~#~1
I went in to check out the new drop of denim that the boys at The Phoenicia Association got in and left with a new pair of Naked and Famous Raw Selvedge Denim, Weird Guy cut; and a shirt by Wrath Arcane with the sickest little pocket that drops from your breast to your waist (perfect for my lighter and cigs) with a little zipper at the bottom. Spent a nice chunk of dough but nothing crazy for such a nice combo I can wear to dinner with the parents or to Old Town/Downtown on a Saturday night.~~#~1
The best food I have found the area and the price is right.  You get so much food you have to take home.  Get there early to get a good seat fills up for lunch.  Priced just right.~~#~1
I love breweries and I love Four Peaks. One of e best breweries in Az. We came here on a Friday night but had no trouble getting a table. This place is huge and packed but still room to move around. We ordered the Hopshot IPA which is a great beer!  I've been here a few time and always had a good experience. I can't wait till the pumpkin porter coming Oct 1st!!!~~#~1
Cold, under done chips. If a Mexican food restaurant can not get this staple right how can I expect them to get much more right.  I arrived for a party that my autocross group was having. Every table had chips and salsa on it. Sombreros were used as the server platters. Senor I don't think this even meets health code. Dinner was served Buffet Style, one of the dishes was called "fandito." I can't think of a less inspired dish. It was simple pasta with some Mexican flavors thrown it, a dish that your mother would make if she had leftovers from Mexican Italian nights. I like really like Mexican food, however I left this place hungry as I did not even want to try any of the dishes other than the salad.~~#~1
Better than rubio's or filaberto's by a long shot open late and has a drive through. When i walked in it was packed and i noticed how cheap the beer and Margarita's were. Wait... I don't remember having ever seen a hole-in-the wall Mexican spot serving booze before (wonder if they sell it via drive through). The menu is like a Jewish Torah being that it has a 100,000 words and is very hard to read. The tacos and burritos also come w/ a side of toquitos that is buried under chiuaua cheese and guacamole. Shrimp and fish taco's are made on tortilla's are made in house. Food is super cheap and tasty. Its too bad that all their locations are in the middle of nowhere.~~#~0
Great service by Angela and their DocFirst time I don't have to wear reading glasses as they switched me to a mono contactVery enjoyable experience and very quickHad a issue with a contact and they track a replacement done right awayDefinitely recommend~~#~1
I am not happy with Sprinkles, but I can't really subtract stars because I make better cupcakes than they do.  Let me first start with the location.  It's very stupid.  Very easy to miss and it blends in with everything else.  No personality.  I guess when you are so famous though, you don't need "personality" to get people in.  Second of all, I hate Scottsdale.  Again, I can't subtract stars for this, it doesn't make sense.As for the cupcakes, they are really only okay.  I will set aside my disdain for chains and judge solely on the quality of the cupcakes.  I ordered a red velvet and a peanut butter chocolate.  The red velvet was very plain.  It lacked the subtle cocoa flavor and the lovely tangy flavor of the buttermilk that should be peeking through the copious amounts of red food coloring.  It wasn't.  I just tasted red and cake.  Not really that great.  To top it all off, my cupcake crown popped off the second I picked it up.  This pissed me off.  It essentially ruined my first bite.  At least I could still eat it.  The cream cheese frosting was so-so.  I really like a big bold cream cheese flavor to pair with a red velvet, and this was barely tangy.  It was super sweet, slightly grainy and it got that crust on the top from sitting out too long.  The red velvet overall was kind of meh.The peanut butter chocolate was definitely not what I had hoped for.  The cake was very dense and peanut buttery, but lacking in sugar.  It was studded throughout with chocolate chips.  The frosting was chocolate, and it's texture was nice and smooth.  It was covered in chocolate jimmies, I just love those.  This cupcake was okay.  The lack of sweetness in the cake made me wished it was saltier.  A saltier cake paired with the delightfully sweet frosting would have made for a much more grown-up and sophisticated cupcake.  It was just okay as is.Sprinkles, I will not be back.  I don't like you.  Good luck in all you do though.  I would never wish bad things on a cupcake bakery.~~#~0
I had a good time at Monkey Pants, we celebrated a buddy leaving for basic training. I will have to go back again. And the one o'clock shirtless shot was awesome. Sorry I don't have more to report because I was drunk and don't remember much else, so that tells you it must be good.~~#~0
My wife and I finally tried CPH and were greatly surprised by everything.  The food, as expected, was superior along with the professionalism of the staff.  The ambiance too was well set as the place could hold large parties very comfortably.  We began the nigth with a bottle of wine, the original chopped salad alons with the rock shrimp.  All were exceptional!  As out main courses, my wife orded the sea scallops and I ordered the short ribs.  (Peter of Cowboy Ciao's must miss this guy.)  Both dinners were cooked to perfection and the staff never left alone.  For dessert, we had coffee and the evening's special, the donut holes with three dipping sauces.  All were fantastic.  The wife and I don't usually rate places with five stars, but this place actually gets how food and service are meant to be as one.  Can't wait until we head back.~~#~1
Some might say that Phoenix is a city without much culture.  That may be true in some aspect, however we have to remember that Phoenix is a young large city compared to other cities that lie within the United States.  So you can say that this city is a work in progress on catching up with everyone's culture expectations.The Japanese Friendship Garden in downtown Phoenix is only seven years old.  Very new to the park scene for this metro, I have to say that it looks great and will only keep getting better in time.  That will happen if people stop saying there is no culture in Phoenix and become a part of the evolving city by visiting places such as this.  The admission and or donations will fund a more desired park for all.The grounds of the garden are very beautiful with a nice flowing stream, several waterfalls, coy fish, and many species of plants.  I can't wait to go back in the next several years to see it become a wonderful masterpiece.~~#~1
Not bad, I usually leave pretty happy and full.~~#~0
This is a very special medical practice with customer service and attention to detail that you hardly ever see in a doctor's office anymore. I started seeing Dr. Ross for Osteopathic Manipulation after having a few back surgeries. He has given me tremendous relief and I highly recommend OMT rather than chiropractic treatment since it works with the tissue and muscles as well as the bones. Anyways, He listens and takes time to treat your WHOLE body unlike most doctors that have one hand on the door knob as they speak to you. I saw a Naturopath in the past and saw Cheryl the P.A. for the first time the other day. She took a lot of time with me, going through my blood work line by line. I was so please that she suggested supplements and knew about things that I learned from the Naturopath...but actually, she knew about more supplements than the Naturopath! So I was really pleased. This is a great office and everyone is like family....they also treat you like you are a part of their family. They make your children feel comfortable too. There are tons of Mickey Mouse figures and videos for them to watch. The nurses have always loved on my daughter since she was a baby. They make sure that all of us have a productive appointment! I highly recommend this office.~~#~1
Best prices and a huge selection. I love their single bottles of beer isle where you can mix and match your own 6-pack of beer. Some of my favorite beers I can only find here.~~#~1
This is the old location. For current reviews, look up Karen's Kreamery Cafe'. Here is what I posted for the new location...please give it a chance. I do not know the owners, I just love supporting a good, local business...Great ice cream, super cute store, extremely CLEAN! The ice cream is good, service is always great, and the location is fun (although a little out of the way). The prices are reasonable. I would rather support a locally owned business and pay more than McDonald's prices and less than Cold Stone prices. If you haven't been, and plan on visiting in the Summer, bring suits for the kids. There is a nice little splash area right next to a big playground. Karen's Kreamery is located in a big park/sports facility. There is also a medium sized skate park. We usually make a fun outing out it. My family loves this place!! Support local businesses!!!~~#~1
All around great food.  True Texas brisket experience.  Meat has great flavor and tasty sides add variety to the offerings.  Don't forget about the sheet cake for dessert!!  I'll be back.  ***Read another review on here talking about wings.  They don't have wings here!!  Get your reviews right people.~~#~1
The Nee House.......well I just wish they would get the concept of customer service! I tend to feel second rate when we go in for dinner. I really like the food but after 5 attempts at dining in with crappy service we have decided it is best for take out only. The food is pretty good and they are super quick when it come to take out. I am happy to say that when I picked up our order yesterday the girl at the front actually smiled and chatted with me while processing our order!~~#~0
I have to say that I'm not a huge fan of D&B's food. Typically if I'm here it's to have a couple beers and remind my husband how good I am at ski-ball. Overall, it's a cool vibe with many different games to play. The drinks are affordable and you can't beat the location (Tempe Marketplace.)~~#~0
This is my neighborhood Chinese Restaurant and a family staple.  I personaly like the roasted / peking duck.  The Shrimp Lo-Mein is good, Fast, Friendly Service, No MSG.Lunch Specials  during the week are awesome too.~~#~1
This was my second visit to Arriba's and believe me, it wasn't my choice. I spent the first 26 years of my life in Southern New Mexico and I miss the food like CRAZY, especially green chile. When you walk into Arriba's it's New Mexico this and New Mexico that and the dishes are named after cities and landmarks in the state.When we told the waitress that in New Mexico green chile sauce doesn't have pork in it she said, "Well, we say that but it's not *really* New Mexican" and walked off. What?!?!The first time there we mentioned this to a Manager and got the same exact reaction. I also asked if I could get a side of plain green chile and was told no. Both times we were being super nice and just trying to start a friendly conversation, had these interactions been better this review wouldn't be here.I'm far from being a vegetarian, I don't eat pork or beef because I don't like it. Also, I didn't ask about the red chile sauce because I'm not a fan, maybe it's porkless and amazing but I can't speak for that...I ordered the Santa Fe Chicken salad.  Iceberg lettuce, slimy greens, cooked onions and bell peppers, mushy tomatoes, half melted greasy cheese clumps and very dry chicken piled on a shell... yuck. If it wasn't for the delicious fresh chips, guacamole and two 99cent happy hour margaritas I would've been VERY unhappy.  I definitely won't ever be back and this time I mean it.~~#~1
We went on a Sunday afternoon, the wait was 45 mins for 4 people. We waited because everyone keeps talking about it. Man, was I starving to death when we were seated. I had the ham and cheese omelet and everyone shared an order of waffle with everyone else. The omelet was good. The waffles were light and fluffy. Good but not to die for. I personally think it was over hyped. It is good breakfast food, not GREAT.~~#~0
Sadly disappointed.  I've passed Lola's an uncountable number of times and each time thought I needed to try it.  I finally did tonight and was terribly disappointed.  For anyone that has been to Firefly in Las Vegas there is just no comparison.  The sangria was decent but nothing special and the tapas were just "so so."  The atmosphere was busy and our service sucked, but it was a very unique and cool environment.~~#~1
I used to shop her constantly when I live right across the street and I still make the drive up there, even though the prices are higher than Safeway. Why?-The staff rocks. Need a certain type of wine? They know where to find it. Need a spice? That's covered too. Every employee is courteous, and most importantly, SPEAKS FLUENT ENGLISH.-Their deli rocks my socks. Always fresh and always tasty, I've purchased more than a few dinners and have never been disappointed.-The ready to cook stuff is delicious too. In the mood for some kind of meat stuffed with a vegetable and/or cheese? This is the place.-I also loved the fresh food cooked every day right in the store. From BBQ to MASSIVE Sunday omelets, the choices are a plenty. Again, not cheap, but you certainly get your money's worth. Go early if you want the breakfast, they run out quick.And you can buy good beer by the bottle! Dogfish Head rocks.~~#~1
Since moving to Arizona I have selected Fry's as my new grocer and am very happy with my choice! I immediately signed up for their VIP card and love seeing the many savings listed on the receipt after every trip.I am especially happy that I have moved closer to this Frys as it is open 24 hours and even when shopping in the wee hours of the morning can expect to see some nocturnal ASU students.Any interactions I have had with the staff have been pleasant and enjoyable.~~#~1
Read all the reviews on Yelp and thought I give Chang's Chinese Buffet a try. With a 4 star rating, I was expecting 4 star quality food. Well, some of it was good, but some of it could be better. First of all the atmosphere was pretty nice. It almost felt like Cheers, where everyone knew your name. Even though we didn't know anyone there, everyone talked to one another. The T.V. in the corner drew most everyone's attention. You could tell who the regulars were. They were up front and closest to the T.V. Most of the food was fresh. The Shrimp was very fresh and tasty. The rice was also seasoned probably and tasted almost as good as back East Chinese food, it just wasn't brown. Orange chicken was good, but a little hard. Not as moist and juicing like I wanted. The chicken was dry. It was flavors well, but was dry inside. Seems like it was under the heating lamp too long. The sweet & sour soup was good, but I've tasted much better. The egg drop soup wasn't too good though. Spare ribs weren't bad. Also a little dry, but not as bad as the chicken. The Egg-foo-yung was not good. Hockey puck shaped or not, it was too watery and didn't taste like real Egg-foo-yung. Everything else was pretty average. For the price, it wasn't bad. I would go back and eat there just so I could have the rice and shrimp. So pretty much 2 stars for the food and 1 for the atmosphere, service and cleanliness. Place was very clean and service was decent. Not a 4 star restaurant. Barely a 3 star. I think my wife gave it 2 stars. If you go there and find certain foods you like, it's probably worth the $5-$6 to go back and eat as much as you want of those particular foods. Skip the bad stuff and eat all of the good tasting foods. Other buffets will run you $10-$15, so this place could be a gem if the food gets better.~~#~0
Great decor. Great food and very good service. You have to try the pork belly pastrami. To die for! Their version of the Manhattan was very good. As for the main courses you can't go wrong with the scallops or the smoked duck. For dessert go with the black & tan pudding. Oh soooo good. Highly recommend this place.~~#~1
Ditto what Kristi M. said.  Thank you to my fellow Yelpers for helping me find this place.~~#~1
Four Peaks serves up some great beers and great eats.  This is no secret so no matter which day out of the year or which hour and minute out of the day you go you will see a full patio, and a populated bar.  Plan accordingly.  Try their Italian beer bread, the Carne Adovada, or the Southwest burger and wash it down with a pint of Hop Knot or Kilt Lifter.  You will be happy you did.  All of Four Peaks' menu items are appropriately priced and you will always leave satisfied.~~#~1
Wow this place is fabulous.  Everything is so fresh and tasty that you can enjoy a healthy and yummy meal without breaking the bank.  The salad bar is huge and they have a fresh soup bar where you can choose numerous varieties of homemade soups.  Great tasting desserts and frozen yogurt machine.  Best Strawberry Lemonade I have ever tasted.  You have to try this place you will not be disappointed.  They need to open locations in the Midwest.Also, I want to give a shout out to the server at the restaurant.  His name is Oscar and he is so wonderful and funny.  He made us all laugh and smile and Oscar is such a hard worker and everyone that visits this location has to say hello to Oscar because he is the nicest man ever!~~#~1
Always love the ALoftsIf you've stayed at one, they're pretty much the sameRooms were clean and comfortable.There was plenty of room in the standard king roomBathroom was nice, you don't have to deal with the miniature shampoos, they're in the wall mounted containers, which is nice.Only thing missing is an iron and ironing board, but other than that, the room was perfect, especially if you like hip, modern decor, which I do.  Rooms are a notch above TheStandard in LA, but not quite as roomy.  The rest of the property was just OK, yes, they have a lounge, but need a restaurant.  This location also does not have a DJ as some of the other ALofts do.All in all though, probably one of the best hotels to stay in while in the Phoenix area, especially for the price.  I heard from the bartender that the one in Tempe is more live than this one.~~#~1
I have always loved this place.   Good Food, fair price,  and typically a couple of cute girls working there.  All around good place..   its a go to .~~#~1
Sanctuary you've been replaced.  Willow Stream Spa is my new fav spa spot.  Loved. Loved. the service.Robe got slightly damp from use, helpful attendant appears and gives me a new one.  Loved the waterfall treatment.  Loved private rooftop pool.  Loved the attendant walking around giving us sun bathers bottles of cold water.  Loved the fitness classes, the facility.All this for $50 during AZ Spa Week.  The facility and service is so f-a-b-u-l-o-u-s here that I would come here anytime and think every penny I spent was worth it!~~#~1
I enjoy "the BOP" as my friend calls it on the same level that I enjoy pizza.  It's good, but it's not my desert island bar.  I go here to meet up with friends.  I've never been there on my own because let's face it.  I'm not likely to be caught dead trolling Scottsdale (even non-Scottsdale Scottsdale) by my lonesome.  The atmosphere is cozy and inviting.  Which kinda turns me off. I like my bars a bit seedier.  But if that's your thing then I'm cool with it.  I hear the food is pretty good for English fare, but hey who wants to waste time eating when you could be drinking?~~#~0
I can't believe this wasn't reviewed yet!  This place rocks, and Dr. Heather is the very best vet in town. She's reasonable in price, thorough in her evaluations, and super kind. She handled the life and death issues so carefully and warmly, and she talks about her own pets and has compassion! When our cat Everett died, she not only called us throughout the whole cremation process, but she sent a card and when we picked up the ashes - she had made a single footprint "ornament" with a ribbon and his name on it as a gift.  Never had a vet do anything so kind.  We have had MANY cats and MANY VETS.  I know a good vet. Go here. Please go here!~~#~1
probably my favorite restaurant :)~~#~1
This is a great hole in the wall shop off of Val Vista Rd. I've been getting the chicken salad sandwich since 2006 and it's the same ever since GREAT! Cookies and bread are awesome as well...~~#~1
I am not going to complain about the quality of my manicure! They did a fabulous job...On the other hand their customer service was a little off. Very unorganized and they could just not get it together. It took them forever to assist us since we didn't have an appointment and are not regulars.~~#~0
This place had me from the moment our waitress asked us if it was o.k. if our water was infused with the flavor of cucumber.  Heck yeah it was o.k. in fact I don't even want to order a drink, I just want the free cucumber water!  My buddy and I decided to start with an app. order of sweet potato waffle fries with dipping sauce.  Delightful!  I ordered the sweet potato and garbonzo burger and the sweet potato and avocado salad side dish.  Notice the sweet potato theme??  I love those crazy orange taters!  The food was really tasty and quite flavorful.  The burger was a little different than I expected because it didn't come on a bun..but no biggie.  In typical girl fashion, my buddy and I split a cupcake...finger lickin' good!  I am picky-picky but this place won me over big time!  Also, I felt that, for the location, their prices were very reasonable.  The prices for those condos located upstairs..well that's gotta be a different story!~~#~1
This Pei Wei is consistant with it's orders being correct & clean. My one wish is that the parking lot it shares with Starbucks & Sidebar were about 15 cars larger. I don't see that happening but a girl can wish can't she?~~#~0
If you don't love Guissepe's, you don't love Italian. Kindly find your way to a chain restaurant that serves bland, unseasoned, frozen-then/microwaved meats, sauces that are fit for an old folks home and an "endless" pasta and salad bar. Go to these places, because Guissepe's is not for you.  It's for lovers of true Northern/Northeast American Italian cuisine. Chicken Parm that is fried, NOT baked, thank you very much. Meatballs that use beef, veal and pork. Sauce that use LOTS of salt, as it should be. Leave your dietary worries at home. In a word: perfecto.Robert's passion for music (he's a well known accomplished cellist in NY circles) and food is unparalleled. He is without peer in the state of Arizona. But be warned... there ain't no endless pasta bowl here. Their weekday lunches are equally superior. This is Italian the way we had it growing up in North Jersey.~~#~1
I discovered this place on my way to a comedy show! It was a Saturday night with an ASU game on and was not packed so we stopped in to get a drink and a bite to eat. First impression was nice! Everything looked clean and open, which i didn't expect from the outside appearance. The service was kinda slow. I have worked in the restaurant/bar industry for 10+ years and I understand how things can go wrong that the customers don't see so i am not going to be hard on these guys. (By the way, the girls are all dressed pretty skimpy and the guys are just short of guidos, so if you have small kids this may not be the place to bring em) So the drink service was slow and throughout we never were really sure who our server was. One girl took our drink order, another brought them, someone else took our food order, someone else brought our food, and someone else came over to see if all was ok... There had to be 15 employees and maybe 25 customers, not to mention the kitchen staff. So the service was slow and not sure why because we were constantly seeing the staff goofing around with one another and as mentioned before it was not busy. BUT the associates were very nice the entire time so it was not bad service my any means, just slow and a little unattentive. It seemed to turn into a club style late at night, which could explain the extensive staff. There is a wheel that you can spin with different actions on it, such as, "kiss a random' '50% off bill" "go plastic" (which apparently gives you a chance to win plastic surgery). I would suggest NOT attempting this if you are not single. Overall, the food was GREAT!!!! The place was clean (bathrooms could use attention). The service could use some tweeking. But we were happy with it!~~#~0
Beautiful Casino. I'm into architect. Yet, if you are a slot machine gambler for the fun of it or not. This may not be a place I would dump my hard earnings into even if it where just for fun. I was out her with my Uncle and although I didn't play. He was having a good time playing 2.5 hours straight. Yet, as I followed in from one slot to another after spending a lot of his money down the drain. I noticed that not only did he not get any winnings, but no one around was winning either during the entire time he played. Really?!?! Not only was he in the hole, but many others. Very ODD that I noticed this. Also, no one was working the floor asking anyone if they'd like a drink. Perhaps, I may be used to how Vegas does it?I'm curious for other feedback from other attendees at this place. Have you had any winnings? We initially came out her for the Vietnamese Concert and Show. I would provide a rating for that, yet it's not a regular performance at this Casino. So I will refrain.~~#~0
BEAUTIFUL! Phoenix doesn't get much more amazing then when you're looking down at her from Dobbins Lookout.A few tips:1. Get there before 6pm. The park closes the entry but if you're in, you can stay as long as you want. 2. Be ready for a drive up a mountain -- scary cliffs and tight corners. Make sure you go slow, watch for hikers and cyclists, and overall be cautious.3. If you're heading to the summit for the views (Dobbins Lookout) bring a jacket or blanket. It's cold and windy when the sun goes down, even in the summer.There are bathrooms but no water fountains at the Lookout.~~#~1
The parking situation is ridiculous, seriously. If you can, walk/bike/bus. It's not worth the energy/effort otherwise.Another downside? If you don't make 6 figures, dont' plan on buying anything here. Seriously. Nothing lends itself to everyday people. Except for m                   aybe Borders (outside of food options).My most recent venture there was on a Fri afternoon and it was PACKED and we literally could not eat anywhere without a decent wait and we were starving... so we were stuck.The bonus is the MoJo, Borders & Paradise there. But nothing else lends itself to my medicore income.~~#~0
Took Travis here for one of our first dates and just LOVE Cibo.  It's situated in a home from 1913 and has colored lights wrapped all around the trees.  You can either sit inside or on the gorgeous patio.  Brick oven pizza and cheese plates offered here and it's definitely a place for a cool date.~~#~1
The reviews were so good that my friend and I had to check it out. We were very disappointed this morning while trying to eat breakfast and swatting tons of flies!!! They were everywhere, on us, our food, the other customers - and this was inside.  The egg sandwiches were served on hamburger buns shaped like rolls - I could have went next door to get one just like it at McDonalds.  Not surprised people from Ahwatukee like this place, it looks nice but the food is so-so.~~#~1
I don't think my husband will let me rate it anything less than 5 stars... Parking for us was okay since we did not park in the lot, we parked at neighboring house for 5 bucks.  Grabbed some towels from the hotel and staked out our claim on the lawn... People were very friendly.  My hubby met some folks from Dixon, IL the day before and they came by to say Hi... and of course, watching the Cubbies - can't beat that!!!~~#~1
We were shopping at the Bass Pro Shop in Tempe and decided to go for ice cream to kill some time before dropping my parents off at the airport. I pulled out my iPad and 'yelped' ice cream. It brought up 4 options in the area and we chose Dairy Queen which was a few blocks away.As luck would have it there was no left turn onto Dobson and we ended up going East on the 202 the opposite direction of the Dairy Queen.  So I searched again and we came up with Yogurtland.  It wasn't luck after all but some ice cream higher power at work to bring us to our frozen yogurt oasis in Yogurtland.  Not only were the ingredients fresh and delicious but the price was reasonable as well. 5 of us each had a scrumptious & generously portioned sundae and our total bill was less than $20!We all enjoyed our selections.  One topping surprise was the Fruit Pebbles cereal my daughter put on her sundae.  The fruity crunch they added was delish!  Yogurtland was a home run!  Thanks For the Yelp!~~#~1
Great product! I was on a mission to make homemade mozzarella with the absolute best ingredients I could find. Organic, whole, raw milk -  this certainly did the trick! We'll be going back that's for sure!~~#~1
I've been giving a lot of 5-star reviews lately, but (in my opinion) they all deserve it.  Movies on Central RULES.  They have 99.9% of every movie title we've looked for.  Since summer started, we've been in there at least once a week.  Bonus:  they have a water cooler right by the door.  Sweet!~~#~1
I can't believe it took me this long to visit Sportsman's but now that I have, I know I'll be making my way back soon enough! Sportman's is a combination wine bar and retail store for spirits, wine, champagne and beer galore. Plus it's locally owned by the Basha's family! I like Sportsman's because it's a friendly and warm atmosphere and they have a great variety of discounts for their different levels of alcohol. The walls are lined from the floor to the ceiling with every type of alcohol. The prices range from $10 - thousands of dollars! It's pretty easy to find any type of brand here. Since it's the holiday season, they are currently offering sales on several of their high-end brands which makes it easy to visit for the purchase of a gift! I also like the fact that guests can visit the intimate bar area and sip on some beverages to take a break from shopping. They also make customized gift baskets!~~#~1
went there for sunday morning hangover breakfast. the mariachi band, while maybe nice outside or not so loud, was so overpowering that we could not talk... the trumpet was terrible for hangover ears... not peaceful or calm at all- so we sat outside. food was good. service was decent. a little pricey but okay because thats what every downtown restaurant has to do. i would go back... just not near that mariachi band.~~#~0
Great coffee shop with tasty lunch and dinner options, very good coffee and cozy atmosphere.  A couple of critiques -  I found the lunch and dinner menu a bit overpriced for what I received.  I frequently stop in early in the mornings for coffee and a muffin (I live in the area).  The muffins are EXCELLENT, unique and tasty . . when they are available. It doesn't seem like the pastry chef begins early enough in the morning to have pastries ready to go around 6:30 or 7am.  Most other niche coffee shops I've been to in the Phoenix area have fresh baked goods ready to go early in the AM for early commuters like myself.~~#~0
Great views, great food, great service and great atmosphere!  We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner here and couldn't believe the neighborhood special - 3 courses for $35!The split pea soup was amazing as well as the bing cherry cheesecake...yum!~~#~1
I bought the HomeRun offer for a bike tune up at Trailhead.  I have to say that I was surprised at the quality of the service they did to my Trek hybrid bike. I could definitely tell the bike was riding better, smoother, more efficient. They even re-installed my bike computer, threading the wire around the front right fork very neatly.  I definitely recommend this place. Oh, and the food is good, too!~~#~1
Great food and even better beer. Staff are always friendly.  My favorite microbrewery in the Valley.~~#~1
After writing the review the other day I had a taste for Pappa's. So I went last night and YA-HUMMEE! I tried something new the Hudson platter and this baby did not disappoint! Perfectly grilled scallops, 2 succulent and sweet lobster tails, 4 huge shrimp brochette. If you are not familiar with shrimp brochette it is shrimp stuffed with Monterey jack cheese and a sliver of Jalapeno, wrapped in bacon and char -grilled. DELICIOUSNESS! It is served with the fabulous dirty rice and sauteed green beans all for are you ready for this wait for it 22.95! I also indulged in sharing a little pecan sweet potato pie with Hagen daas vanilla ice cream and bourbon sauce. WOOHOO! FYI all deserts purchased until July 26th will have a portion of the proceeds go to a local food bank! Dinner last night was sooo freakin good I may be back tonight! Bon Appetite~~#~1
I'm glad I bought my tickets back in August when the event was first posted.  I'm not sure the organizers knew what an amazing turn out they would have but the event was sold out so tickets were not available at the door.  We arrived at 11:15 (doors opened at 11) and while standing in line to get in there was a staff person checking to make sure we all had tickets and letting people know that if they did not, the event was sold out. Once inside it was a sea of cupcakes!  Tiny cupcakes that were delicious!  I didn't taste one that I didn't like.  Liberty Market was my fave I think.  Espresso Carmel and Red Velvet!  YUM!!!  Cruelty Free Cakes makes delicious vegan cupcakes too!  I also liked the ones from Cry Baby Ranch. I'm going to have to find them again at the 20th street Farmers Market and Old Town Scottsdale Farmers Market.  And everyone was so nice!  $10 got you all the cupcakes you could eat and water AND milk!!  And it was for two very worthy causes.  Singleton Moms and Safe Haven For Animals.  There were also raffles, a cupcake eating contest and cupcake decorating for the kids.  So many festivals these days charge you to get in and then, once inside, charge for everything else.  People can't afford that these days so it was refreshing to go to an event and not be nickel and dimed for everything.  I appreciate that.  And best of all my daughter had a great time!  There were lots of people so it was a little overwhelming for her but she loved it.  Both of us are just coming down from our sugar high.  It was great to see Gabi and Lindsey manning the Yelp booth and our very own Thomas S. helping with emcee duties!  Will I be back next year?  You bet!!  And you should come too....just make sure you get your tickets early!~~#~1
Our administrative assistant at work is a big fan of Bertha's.  And now, I am, too.  She's ordered in lunch from Bertha's a couple of times.  The first time, it was the Thai chicken salad, which I loved.  Today, we had two salads and a sandwich tray.  I don't even like sandwiches.  I helped myself to both salads, and picked up a sandwich, intending to dismantle it and eat the meat and cheese.  Inexplicably, I took a bite of the sandwich, and said "OMG!  This is so good!"  It was the turkey w/bacon and avocado sandwich.  My friend seated directly to my left said, "Let's go to Bertha's and order more of these after lunch."  They were truly that good.  The salads were both great, too.  I think we'll be frequenting Bertha's a lot in the immediate future.~~#~1
I don't know what I would do if this store ever closed.  It's right near our home, has an excellent selection of both wine, meats, and produce.  Note that wine is mentioned first... I can't help it!  The service is always really good too.  Everyone who works here seems like they really love their job.  The only issue I have ever had was not being able to get basil a couple of times.  I got over it.  :D~~#~1
I always look forward to a haircut with my fave Barber, David. $13 always gets me the cut I want. I used to head down to a another Barber off of Central Ave but never got the haircut I wanted. Now I never have to worry about that. So if you're ever in need of a Barber shop cut, give David or one of his gals a try. Cheers!~~#~1
My van broke down and I needed a tow real fast because I had my kids with me in the heat. I looked up towing on my phone and just happened to pick Leyva's. I am so glad I did. I spoke with Chris and he was very nice and helpful. The driver was there within 20 minutes and was also so, so nice to me and my kids. He was very clean and professional and courteous.  The whole experience was better than I have every had with a towing company. I keep their card in my wallet now and gladly refer them.~~#~1
this may be the fastest I have ever Yelped and it proves that I am hopelessly addicted to this foresaken site!!!Was in the area and figured I would hit up this burrito place.  i was in the mood for the slop that makes a tasty burrito.  This certainly was not bad.HUGE burrito.lots and lots and lots of meattons of sauce, guac, cheese, pico, and more of all that too.Pretty tasty and now I am stuffed. I am in the area from time to time so I think I will go back and kill some more burritos.~~#~0
This was my first restaurant in Phoenix. I was taken here for a lunch prior to an interview I had. I was pretty nervous about the whole situation so I don't remember too many details, but I would recommend this place if you're a sushi lover or on the go and need a quick lunch to eat at your desk. Service was great too.~~#~0
Delicious food, amazing martini's, and wonderful desserts. Every dish I have eaten here has been nothing short of awesome. First, to start they have house infused seasonal vodkas. You can see the vodkas steeping on the bar when you walk in. Appetizers are not overly filling - The frito misto is always seasonal so depending on the time of year you will get different things. The coating is perfect and light so you can really taste the vegetables but still get the crunch. The same is true with the mozzarella. The cheese was fresh and the crunchy crust of fried coating around it was perfect. As far as entrees go, the portions are perfectly sized and flavorful. The pasta is perfectly cooked and coated with whatever you choose on the menu. I love the simplicity of some and the complexity of others. Finally, desert has always been good. Try the limoncello cheesecake or any flavor of gelato and you certainly won't be disappointed.~~#~1
This is the FIRST Red Robin I had ever been to (earlier this year).  The service is always really good.  Good Veggie Burgers, love the bottomless fries (garlic & sweet potato), cool shakes and mixed drinks.  One of the few restaurants to stay open late in this town!!!  Great place to come after a movie at Harkins.~~#~0
Perfect burritos, polite staff with a couple cuties working here.  I love Chipotle!~~#~1
A few years ago my husband bought me a gift certificate for this spa. Oh my god - it was the most beautiful spa I had ever went to! I had a facial and a massage. In addition to that - I got unlimited day usage of their spa stuff! They had a beautiful locker room that had a sauna and jacuzzi in it. An secluded area where you could lay outside - naked! They also had a huge pool out behind the spa where you could just layout and be lazy. Oh- also they had some sitting rooms with magazines, fire places -oh my goodness. It was awesome! AND - the prices weren't that high compared to other spa's in the valley. Check it out if you can!~~#~1
Let me start by saying after my experience I surly wish they had half or quarter stars and I am not often found with a lack of words but this is going to take some effort to stomach.Strolled into this establishment at about 1:30 am, now to their credit I fully understand the crowd on mill at these hours so I lower my levels of expectations..Place is moderately busy as we walk in, I get to the counter, order some pepperoni pizza and a pretzel with 2 drink cups. Second drink cup is forgot after they ran out of the dispenser, after I remind him he gets a fresh stock of cups to replenish his dispenser but first takes his hand, fingers placed inside the cup and hand me one. Yuck.. Gf didn't catch it so I gave her the first cup and took the lingering finger taste cup as my own.Fast forward a few minutes, guy is in there , his friends are loud and his face is cut wide open from who knows what incident.. He is arguing and finally his friends get him out the door. Now if I ran this place that guy and his yelling and problems would have been asked to stay, his hands Nd bloody shirt bumping and squeezing past people was discussing . But.. Let's let that go because it's busy and again this is MIll and it is 2 am..Fast forward 10 minutes.. Tell the guy the ice machine is out, several minutes later.. They fill it.. Again it's busy, no big deal on that one, and with the high temp in the place maybe it killed on the fingerprint bacteria in my cup while we waited.. "I'm a wishful thinker"Several more minutes go buy of people bustling past, smearing nastily cheese wish sandwich wrappers all o over the floor as We walked by "place was trashed" I go back up and ask the guy for our order.. He said", oh sorry forgot" I was amused but it's just sliced pizza and a pretzel.. He tosses them in the oven, and a couple minutes later I get them. Well pizza had obviously been there forever but it was pizza, pretzel was hard as a rock and couldn't eat it.Then the show starts.. there had been a few people in there, that obviously knew the gentlemen working the register, the flooding actions are the cause for this reviewing of the above..Short list-employee is wiping his sweaty face by hand, receiving money..then is prepping pizza with topping BY BARE HAND.. Placing it in the oven, all with out gloves. This occurs over and over, then when his friends arrive there is a round of hand slaps... Um.. Where did these guys come from, did they wash their hands?, eww.  So in the 45 minutes I am in here,no hand washing, no gloves..his hands on food, toppings, money, hands, face, along with all over surfaces possible. Freaking DISGUSTING.But it gets better.. His friends that he is conversing with are about to ice the cake..  One of them this red headed guy is reaching behind the counter near the pick up, and grabbing fries out of the Bin with his hands.. This happens no less than 10 times..Another one ask his to meet them in the bathroom... Um what? Yes.. That locked bathroom father 1 am that is closed off to customers.. Hmm my imagination can only wonder what brief activity occurred in the restroom. could my dazed and non health conscious server and front man for this business also be doing drug's one can only speculate. His actions after reflected a very relaxed and dazed person.Where I will give this guy a couple points, is end of the night he started picking up the place as it had slowed, well this obviously is his job and they have to clean up at the end of the night anyways..but was surprised at this point. At this point and my food not eaten we are done being entertained by watching all this and he asked to take our plate at which time he noticed I didn't eat much. He asked if the pretzel was not good and I choose this time to politely tell him the reasons above as why we didn't finish. He took it in stride, with no attitude but said simply they got busy and backed up. I do appreciate that but honestly there is ZERO excuse for even a small percentage of the actions to have taken place. I see this as a health risk and was more comfortable at taco stands in Mexico than this establishment. In short, I'll be contacting the owner of this location. I do realize this is a late night food offering, I do realize the clientele, but I also know this is unacceptable and some poor guy who is mismanaging this place needs a wake up call.I will be back very soon, if anything just to see if changes are made after I voice my concerns. If needed ill be happy to forward my videos to the county health inspector.-Thanks for reading this little novel.~~#~1
Decent place for legit Chinese food with the usual fast service and decent prices. We were able to enjoy roasted duck, crispy pan fried noodles and honey walnut shrimp. All winners we thoroughly devoured. It's location is convenient and parking is readily available. Seating is plentiful so there was no wait when we arrived. Overall, a good find we'll probably go back to when we're in the mood for real Chinese din din.~~#~0
We live by and love this place! Happy hour is most def the biggest bang for your buck! Try the shrimp boil but only if you like your shrimp a little spicy!~~#~1
Gallo Blanco has the most delicious ceviche I've ever tasted in AZ. Portion size is plentiful and the chips are quality. I love the indie music selection it really adds to the vibe of Gallo Blanco. If I'm in the area I make it a point to visit.~~#~1
I like F&E. There are some good things in there, but it's kind of like you have to play by its own rules. If you walk in with one specific item on your list, (Examples: pico de gallo. Not that uncommon, right? How about good hamburger buns? Only one kind? Really?) chances are you might not find it. But, you will be tempted by the premade meals and delightful snacks. Fresh chicken salad? I didn't know I wanted that when I walked in, but now I have it. Don't come here if you have a strict list that you need to shop for or if you're seeking hard-to-find items. Come here with a friend late on a sunday night when you need ideas to make meals for the rest of the week.The store is indeed freezing cold and kind of has that sterile hospital feeling. Lots of really bright lights and WHITE everywhere. The 50% off stuff is great. I got a big package of fettuccine for a dollar. Their prices are a bit odd, though. $0.99 for a pack of four bratwurst, and $2.50 for a can of generic tuna? Well, alright. I'll be back! But now I know under what circumstances to shop here.Highlight: This location seems to be run by a rather sassy nun.~~#~0
Rude, rude, rude. I will *never* go back to this place. I don't normally carry cash and when I went to pick up my son's pants for his recital that night, I was in a little bit of a jam (they only take cash or checks). When I suggested they might put this on the claim ticket, or at least mention it when people drop off their clothes, the owner pointed to an itty bitty sign and told me "we have signs everywhere." The owner was hostile and argumentative and just didn't care about what I had to say. Then he hovered over me while my son tried his pants on, like I was going to steal something (the place is TINY). I went to an ATM and pulled out cash, it wasn't that big of a deal, but this place has no customer service skills whatsoever. I won't ever go there again. Steer clear.~~#~1
The Vine Tavern (i'll omit the word Eatery as i'm fairly certain this term can't be applied to the food they serve at this establishment) is a vortex sort of culmination hang-out for low-brow Fred Durst clones and future (day-shift) strippers. With that being said, this cesspool of a building hasn't burned to the ground yet so I feel compelled to warn others before they consider spending an evening there.Being new to the Tempe area, myself and a small group of friends decided to drop in to check it out.  As we approached the-dimly lit building I began to have second thoughts: my bloomy sense was tingling (more on this later). As we entered we were greeted by a lovely bouncer type gentlemen who begged us to pay the 5$ cover.... seriously. We were seated towards the back near a group of teenage mothers and their burly counterparts. We ordered food...The food arrived in a timely manner, it may have been poisoned but i was too hungry to care. I ordered the mushroom/swiss burger.... 9 dollars-ish. If Mcdonalds ever begins selling their products in the frozen food aisle of grocery stores it might taste something like what they serve at The Vine. I had immediate food regret, my only consolation was the 1$ you call its and the poor old man behind the mic with his acoustic guitar wrapping up his set. Surreal. .. . .We regrettably paid and escaped out the back. Good: Cheap Drinks !!!!  Bad: You may be stabbed!!!~~#~1
What a joy to discover Thai Lahna with my friend Keith Galbut who has been going here for over 10 years. I can see why. Family owned and operated - and everyone is very friendly and helpful. Of course all that matters is the food, right - and it's marvelous. We tried several dishes and all were well spiced and wonderful. Highly recommended.~~#~1
Cool atmosphere and good service.The food is good but seems they are still working on their recipes. The complimentary bread was cold (a small but important detail) and the "salsa verde" was mediocre. I had the Orange and Fennel Prawns and there was too much orange and barely any fennel. My boyfriend had the Lobster Mac n' Cheese. Said the lobster didn't taste fresh and the sauce was too rich.Ernie, the manager came over and introduced himself. He explained the remodel from the previous concept. We'll definitely come back to support a local place at CityScape. I just hope to see some improvements in the food.~~#~0
I went here last year when I was in AZ, I thought it was God's gift to Mexican food... I was a bit tipsy last year when I went there... I went again last week, it was "ehhhh". Don't get me wrong, still good, but not as wonderful as I remembered... not even close. We had to wait an hour for a table, the waiter made us wait about 15 minutes (not kidding) for water and chips/salsa... Seriously, 15 minutes? You dumbass! The desserts were super good though, that was the upside...~~#~0
My roommate came home the other night with a Chocolate Cream pie and oh. my goodness! It is AMAZING! The crust is this wonderful crunchy chocolately wonderfulness. I think she bought a Groupon and I don't know how much she paid but the pie was so good, regardless of full price, I'm sure it's worth it!~~#~1
Hmmm ... where to start.  Food was good, flavorful, no complaints; although for the price I did not think the portions were that great - but everything was tasty and everyone enjoyed their meals.It's a big open place, with concrete floors and picnic table type environment.  Patio with misters and big open doors to the outside.  A good atmosphere for BBQ.  Someone mentioned the parking being marginal (very true - same as when this was a bar in it's prior life).  I think my biggest downside is how much I had to serve myself - go to the counter to order, pay, get to table, get drinks, get place settings (plastic utensils), for a beer have to go to the separate bar area, order, pay, return for more, etc. (can't order beer where you order food).While I enjoyed the food, not sure how often I'll be back - would not want to be there when it was crowded and have to wait in lines repeatedly.~~#~0
The Phoenix metro area is definitely not known for authentic Asian cuisine. China Magic Noodle House, however, is the real deal. This place reminds me of the Taiwanese delis that I used to go to in LA, as well as noodle houses that I've frequented in Taipei.They have a great selection of cold noodle, hot noodle and soup noodle dishes. And, a variety of ways to have your noodles (I typically order the thick noodles or shaved noodles). There's always a veggie on the whiteboard to try and the fried tofu is very tender and tasty with the dipping sauce.If you're looking for a reasonably priced, ethnically authentic meal in Phoenix (especially the East Valley), China Magic Noodle House should be near the top, if not first, on your list. the only negative that I would have about this place is that there isn't enough choices where chicken is the main protein.~~#~1
Was looking for a nice dinner place in Peoria to send my mom and step-dad for a birthday celebration.  The people at Flemings were wonderful.  They took my request over the phone and made sure they had a lovely evening.  Mom raved about the service and the photos she sent made the food look fantastic!~~#~1
The food here is good. It's not outstanding, or anything to write home about, but it IS tasty.  The whole making a tortilla in front of your eyes seems a little kitch-y to me, but so what? Everyone has to have a marketing ploy.I've eaten in, and taken out, and the burrito quality is about the same.  Personally, I like Chipotle better, as I like the dressing on their veggie salad.My one beef (amusing, since I only get the beans) is that they were a little too light handed with everything. I got hardly any guacamole or sour cream, and that is really what helps to make a delicious tasty burrito of goodness in my eyes.Will I go back? Certainly, if it's on my way and I'm hungry. Will I choose to seek it out? Probably not.~~#~0
great food... HUGE wine list (same as Kashmere)...  whatever you do make sure to get there cob salad thing (stedson chopped salad)... I substituted the salmon for chicken, but it is still out of this world... i know people that have brought in chefs from out-of-town to figure out what is in it so they can bring it home to their city... don't remember much else... but i remember i have never had anything bad since i have been going there.~~#~1
i know they're doing their jobs and i can understand that. but we couldn't shake our saleslady. we finally had to say that if she didn't leave us alone, we were going to leave. we absolutely couldn't discuss anything because she was CONSTANTLY THERE! we even said we'll come find you if we need any help. literally any piece we glanced at, touched, or came near, she was on top of us "oh isn't this a great piece. we can set up financing and lock in the sales price, and if you buy 5k worth today with cash, we'll throw in...etc". every single item. they have nice stuff, no question about that. but i know this game. and it's not fun. it makes shopping miserable. and besides, it's too expensive for us. we got 3 of the same, exact pieces (same model, same sku) at pruitts for less than half we would have paid at Ashleys.~~#~0
Very delicious food without long waits! The staff is very friendly and accommodating. I look forward to going back.~~#~1
Steak, yes, but 2 other words first come to mind when reminiscing about Modern Steak: Retail Therapy.No, I'm not talking about the fact that Modern Steak is conveniently (albeit awkwardly) located in Scottsdale's Fashion Square. Instead, I think back fondly on a delightful little cocktail -- Belvedere, Grand Marnier, strawberry, basil and lemon juice, served chilled in a martini glass (as expected), but also with a little carafe of extr drinky-drink (unexpected), complete with a suspended ice-ball to keep your drink cold while you sip -- without watering it down. GENIUS. Ok, ok, so you're wondering: why the 3 stars? Well, genius cocktails only get you so far. I like to think that I've sampled a fair number of steaks in my day, from frou-frou to straight-from-farm fresh, and I gotta say that the whole steak experience at Modern Steak was about a 3 -- not bad, but not amazing. Just pretty...average. And for $46, I'm not %100 convinced it was worth it. Let me elaborate: - 12 oz. filet: I ordered it three of their five sauces -- the Steak Sauce (which cost extra...bummer) and the House-Made Ketchup. Now, one of the sauces that I simply a-dore with a nice steak is a Peppercorn sauce...so I was a little bummed when they didn't have one. So after getting a recommendation for the Steak Sauce, I went with it, and it was...well, kind of a let down. I didn't love either sauce, truth be told. Granted, I haven't tried the other three, so I guess I'll have to go back and check them out, but all in all, my steak experience was lessened by these sauces, rather than heightened. Boo. - Sides: we ordered the Roasted Brussel Sprouts and Yukon Gold Potato Puree. The sprouts were...meh, but I'm willing to admit that I've been spoiled by the best brussel sprouts of all time at a little place called Larchmont Grill in Los Feliz, CA. They are fantastic. But even so, I'm not convinced these were really that great...I felt they were a definite let down. As for the potatoes, they were literally SWIMMING in butter, which made them very difficult to eat...and to top it all off, both sides were pretty small, even for two people. All in all, I felt the level at which the meal was prepared was a bit sub-par considering the prices and what I can imagine they were going for...there are a lot of restaurants that do what they do, and do it a lot better, so if they want to compete, they're going to need to up their game. UP it. Combined with the fact that we were sitting awkwardly on the patio, which was really just sort of jutting out into the mall, I can't justify more than 3 stars. However, would I try it again? Absolutley. Get the steak? Maybe not. But I think that, for a relatively new restaurant, they're well on their way.~~#~0
Very dated but clean. Fine for a one night stop on road trip. Free coffee in morning & cookies at night. Bathroom tiny!~~#~0
One word: PISTACHIO...in all its glory...no need to say more.~~#~1
Ruby Tuesday's salad bar and healthier choices (With caloric count for calorie counters) for entrees is what sets it apart from other chain restaurants that serve your basic American style cuisine.  The salad bar includes 2 types of base greens (Iceberg and mixed greens), with various toppings (Edamame, peas, mushrooms, croutons etc.) and dressings (Italian, low fat balsamic, ranch, thousand island, etc).  Generally, with any main entree, you will have your choice of side and salad bar, or 2 sides.  They also have more healthy side options such as roasted spaghetti squash and steamed broccoli.  My husband had the chicken trio, and I had the creole fish on our visit.  The chicken was nicely presented, and was fairly tender and juicy.  Of the three different toppings (Balsamic and tomato, mushroom cheese, and mango salsa), my least favorite was the mango salsa since the mango in it, while fresh, wasn't totally ripe.  The creole fish was presented in a Spartan way, with just one piece of fish with a mound of side next to it on a plain white plate.  The fish (Some type of white fish, maybe carp?) was a freshwater white-flesh fish and had a decent seasoning and was cooked well. Service was friendly, but we did not have any silverware on our table when we were seated and had to ask for it after our entrees were served to us.  Drinks were refilled quickly as needed.I haven't indulged in a lot of the desserts, but I am a fan of the Italian creme cake.  It's moist, and not too sweet.  Prices are moderate, and entrees will be around 15 dollars, give or take a few dollars.~~#~0
It's Baja Fresh, what can i say? It's clean, they're fast and it's a hell of a lot better than McDonald's. I usually call in my lunch order from work and it's almost always ready and waiting when I get there to pick it up.I do have to say that their pico de gallo is great and I could probably live on just that for the rest of my life. I get extra cups of it and eat it all by itself.~~#~0
When I first stepped into Smeeks, my entire face lit up, I was figuratively (and quite literally) "a kid in a candy store." It's is a true one of a kind store, it's so entertaining to just walk around in. The decor is fun, the inventory is even more fun, and the photo booth is by far the most fun!The walls are full of great novelty items, such as the Smoking Baby (that actually smokes!), Yodeling Pickle (that actually yodels!), and Fake Cigarettes that are surprisingly realistic! Plus, Smeeks has a lot of really cool, and delicious candy. My personal favorite was the Fat Pig organic chocolate bar (with Puntini coming in a close second). Smeeks is most definitely my new favorite store in CenPho!~~#~1
Honestly the drinks are overpriced and have a hint of rubbing alcoholHonestly my lunch was just okayHonestly they have a drink called the stigmataHonestly I am dreading having to give them 2 stars given the hypeBut, I am supposed to be honest.This place has been the buzz since before I returned stateside. My coworkers had also been hearing the same buzz. We just had to go as the finale to our week of lunch. Yeah, I probably would've been better off at the Billet Bar across the street. I mean it is biker week. The people watching would've been stellar. The only people watching I had at RnR was the gorgeous server outside our window on the patio. But even his piece of art body won't bring me back.The first hint should've really been the overpriced drinks we started with. I figured for that price they should be damn good so I ordered some lime concoction. A coworker got the stigmata. Holy strong... and not in a good way. I mean, I appreciate my drink as much as the next but not when I can't even enjoy it. One of my other coworkers on the other hand, was enjoying his blue moon. That was until he held it up to take another sip and the entire bottom of his glass fell off.. yes.. fell in one piece.. onto our table. What happened to the contents do you ask? That went all over him, the table, inside someone's wallet, and onto an iPhone and my face. The waiter wasn't even really apologetic about it aside from giving us some extra cloth napkins which weren't soaking anything up at all. No wet rag, no comp, no apology, nothing but another glass of blue moon we were hoping wasn't bought at a prank store and a sticky table, faces, and sunglasses.The chicken lollipops were not what I expected, but really weren't bad. I did enjoy those. I also enjoyed the presentation of my fries. Cute silver bucket. Tons of fries. Couldn't finish.I ended up getting a chicken sandwich that had brie and some other goodness on it. Totally forgot to order it without tomato, but I picked it off easily. I know what you're thinking, they serve breakfast here til 2pm, why the hell did the breakfast queen not order breakfast. Honestly, none of it wooed me enough that it looked delicious. They had a make your own omelet that was on my short list of things to order, but I'm glad I didn't after seeing a coworker's tiny ass omelet and bread with no other side for $10. Also, I highly doubt their Amish french toast is all that Amish. Just sayin'. I know a bit or two about Amish goodness.So, back to my lunch.. it was just eh, which was sad. The description sounded so delicious I really was expecting to be wowed.. finally.. after all the mishaps I'd had up until this point. I do admit I loved the bread. It was delicious. I also appreciated that despite them not having honey mustard, aioli, or anything else to dip my fries in aside from ketchup and barbeque sauce (which was given with the sweet potato fries.. ew) they tried to make me honey mustard. Unfortunately it was just honey mixed in with bottle mustard ketchup. I ended up using the ranch dressing from the lollipops. What I paid for this was ridiculous.The way they reacted to the beer mishap was ridiculous.The food was meh.Not even I was tempted to try breakfast there.It was like the beautiful model that has no brains.... and I want some brain thought going into my dining experience. Don't try to woo me with simple sex appeal.One of my coworkers commented that maybe in 6 months when the pans are seasoned well after being used the place will be worth it to try again. I told him maybe.Had to edit that someone from our table got terribly ill too... oy vey!~~#~1
This review corresponds to my first Check-In to Oregano's. Outside of the wait times, I've not had a bad experience @ Oreganos. The food was good, the people were friendly and I had a good time. This visit was no exception. Even when my wife got meat in her minestrone soup, the situation was handled impressively well. I've known for years that my wife is a VERY picky eater when dining out, she left all smiles and so did I.It's one of few places I go to with "stuff" on the walls that I don't find obnoxious.  Keep up the good work.~~#~1
Excellent brunch food and great Bloody Marys! They make their own bread onsite, which is to die for! Love it. Hate the valet parking.~~#~1
Chopped Salad was fabulous, as was the lamb burger. Service was top rate.~~#~1
Visited this restaurant last week with a groupon special, not expecting their best service since I was using a coupon. I was pleasantly surprised on how great the service was!  Our waitress was knowledgeable and friendly which made for a great happy hour!  Their guacamole is great and their assorted chip basket made everything extra yummy!I'll definitely be returning :)~~#~1
This is the most comfortable place to have a glass of wine, relax, and enjoy some great food. Their service is amazing. There are really comfy seats and couches inside and great outdoor seating. You could literally spend hours here. They have wi-fi, so you can chill out on your CPU or IPad. The bar super cool. Very nice bartenders that are knowledgable and accommodating. Their wine is killer, of course, or they wouldn't be named 5th and Wine right?~~#~1
Pita Jungle can do NO WRONG in my eyes! The food has always been amazing! I have been going here for 10 years or so and have never left displeased.  Also they are a home spun local business, which always makes me happy! Yes, they do have hipper then thou hipster working there, but those hipsters can sure make a mean hummus! I have many favorites which is starting to make it hard when I go there, because I want them all! Pita Jungles portions are always so generous that I have never even finished what I ordered. My new fav is the Lentil Fetoosh Salad, the mix of the lentils and rice with the caramelized onions over the fresh mixed greens with that lemon vinaigrette is WHOA! Its incredibly filling, split it with 2 or 4 friends, seriously! Another fav is off the starters section, but its so much food that I never finish! The lavosh pita crisp! Its like a fancy spicy supped up cheese crisp! Thank You Pita Jungle for bringing bomb diggity food to the valley!~~#~1
The only reason 1 star can be given is the flavor choices and taste.  The SMALLEST wings I have ever seen, they must be off of baby chicks.  I thought it was getting punked, actually LOL.  Never to be back~~#~1
I have so many friends that love this chain, but I'm not a fan. I've eaten at different locations across different states, but always end up sick. I think that I must be allergic to a seasoning that they apply to everything. I've gotten sick from salad, pasta, to steaks. Needless to say, if a friend wants to eat dinner here, it's tea or water only for me.~~#~1
I love the menu here it has many selections of many cultures including Italian!!!~~#~1
The shaved ice at Bahama Bucks reminds us of vacationing in Hawai'i! Lots of flavoring options, and a cheap date!  Haven't tried the smoothies yet, but we heard they're great!~~#~1
By far my favorite restaurant in valley. Deliciously spicey. A bit pricey if you're picking and choosing items but they're complete meals are a pretty good bang for the buck. Not actually sure about the service as I've only gotten takeout but if its any where close to the quality of food, then it must be awesome.~~#~1
Hands down, the best breakfast I've had in Tempe/Phoenix.   We arrived on a Sunday morning around 9am and had no wait for a table.  The service was friendly and attentive.  A few slip ups on forgetting things in the kitchen (e.g. bringing someone's toast), but our waitress was great.Everyone in our party loved their food.  I had the Vatican skillet (which we still can't figure out why it's called the Vatican...?) and blueberry pancakes.  Others had the three musketeers omelette and the breakfast burrito.  All of the food was awesome.And then there was the brandied blackberry bread pudding dessert.  Oh. My. God.  I don't even have the words to describe it.  At least not words that are appropriate for yelp.  It alone is worth a trip to this restaurant.I'll be back.  Not soon enough.~~#~1
Absolutely loved this place! My fiance and I came across the Arrogant Butcher while we were in Phoenix celebrating my birthday and our engagement. My fiance had found it on yelp and said "we must go there for lunch one day" while we were there. We ended up going here for my birthday dinner, after a "higher end" establishment couldn't accomodate my gluten allergy. The food, the drinks and the waitstaff were great! It was so good, we went back the next day!~~#~1
This is one of the best Asian meals you may ever eat. They are amazingly inexpensive for lunch too. The house fried rice and the wonton soup are perfection. The Lincoln location is prettier but the food is the same.~~#~1
Wow, love that a place like this moved in down the street. Inexpensive, fresh, delicious - everything I want in a mexican restaurant.My soft shell carne asada taco was fantastic -- freshly prepared and topped with guacamole, which by the way is super creamy. Basket of chips are free, as is the toppings bar -- every one of the 6 or sauces were delicious. I plan on frequenting Salsa Blanca ; )~~#~1
This is the closest to a New York hipster style coffee shop I've seen in Arizona.  They serve beer too.  Problem is that the espresso was unbelievably bitter.  Cookie happy hour is pretty cool though.~~#~1
Dear Yelp: Why can't there be a 3.5 star rating?  I wanted to give this place 4 stars, but will have to wait for another visit to bump it up.I have never been here before, so I consulted with my fellow Yelpers for their input.  The service was quick and prompt.  Our waitress was friendly and on top of things.  I was impressed by the selection of beer, although small, with an offering of Alaskan Amber Ale...mmmm.We decided to keep things simple this trip.  12 wings, medium flavor, one large margherita pizza with garlic on 1/2.  GOODS: I LOVE the mozzarella that they use!  I have never tasted cheese this cheesy or this good on my pizza.  NO JOKE.  The wing sauce was also delicious and they provided you with a perfect amount of sauce to cover the wings.  AND, the ranch was NOT watered down, which I am traditionally used to.BADS:  The parking lot sucks.  We had to park across the street from their main lot to find a spot.  Also, the tomatoes on the pizza were unripe.  Our pizza was soggy in the center, perhaps from the tomato juice during the cooking process, and it made for bad leftovers in the microwave the next day.So, with the combination of the both, I will definitely say that I shall return to give them another sampling in due time, and perhaps bump up that star to where I think it should be in the back of my mind.~~#~0
Set in a restored 1913 bungalow, Cibo (pronounced "CHEE-boh") has hardwood floors, exposed brick, a stained-glass panel and a fireplace to set the mood while revitalizing the downtown Phoenix area with beautiful salads, antipasto, artisanal pizzas and housemade fresh pasta.    I flew in for business on a Wednesday night. My friends picked me up and they decided to take me to Cibo.    Right off the bat, I was impressed with the ambiance this place exudes. Every corner of this place is romantic. Great for small parties, or just two.    We were seated outside at a table for four. The server was very well versed with the wine list, and the menu. She right away offered some appetizer ideas, and wine parings. All good offerings. We decided on a bottle of Vipra rossa. It was over all a good wine, and went well with dinner. Also we ordered the 3 Pair Buschetta. This little gem was awesome. It came to our table on a cutting board type platter. Three little buschetta slices each having a different topping. First was grape tomatoes and basil, the second had cannelini beans, and the third had prosciutto crudo and mozzarella. Ah Mazz ING.     Being that I wasnt feeling super adventurous on the meal, I just ordered the Diavola pizza for one. Average pizza I'd have to say, was not very inventive. Good presentation though.   Service was a five.~~#~0
My husband and I absolutely LOVE this restaurant! Anytime I find myself craving Mexican food, the first place that pops in my head is Salsa Blanca. We have always encountered friendly, welcoming staff and amazing, fulfilling food. What more could you ask for?!~~#~1
Best place in Arcadia to get a coffee or a tea. Lots of friendly locals and great place to sit outside to people watch and read the paper in the morning early lunchtime.~~#~1
Every friday, my dad and I eat here. We order the same thing... pizza wraps. they are good and fillng. iced tea hits the spot. Typical strip mall pizza.~~#~0
This place needs a face-lift, the whole concept and decor is outdated and needs some help. I think their sushi and other food items are alright, although they try to be so trendy and in reality there menu is pretty blah. Its a fun place to grab a drink and sit on the patio, but the excitement and trendiness of this place is completely gone.~~#~0
Best Steak Ever. That is all.  Everything on the menu is amazing. Go now.~~#~1
in honor of the impending superbowl XLV, i wanted to write my majerles review. this year though, instead of hitting up a sports bar for the biggest day in football, i'll be going to a party. a real rager. if i wasn't though, i would definitely be pressed up against majerles front door bright and early superbowl morning. it's a great sports bar.the weirdest thing about majerles is their name. someone finally told me it wasn't pronounced "mah jer lees" like i had thought.... it's pronounced "mar lees". so let me get that out first.i'm a big sports nut.... well, let me rephrase that. i'm a big sports nut when it involves REAL sports. i won't make fun of anyone, but if it's not football, baseball, basketball or hockey i don't wanna hear about it. unless of course we're talking about extreme sports like surfing, skateboarding, etc. being a fan of sports makes me a fan of sports bars. there are only 3 main things i need in order for a sports bar to be great in my opinion. let me lay them out for you:a good selection of beers, happy hour specials and bar snacks--- yes, majerles has this in spades. large selection of beers and any sports bar that has perrier jouet, vueve clicquot and dom champagnes must be praised.(mostly because i think this is absolutely hilarious. WHO orders pricey champers at a sports bar? haha!) also, put me down as a fan of their reuben reuben and tenderloin sliders. yum.the service--- there's nothing worse than sidling up to a bar, excited to watch your team kick some ass and ordering a drink from a bartender that seems bored and unhappy. every bartender i've come in contact with at majerles truly loved being at work (or they at least acted like it). bartenders attitudes really carry a lot more weight then they realize. happy bartender =  happy bar patronsthe strategic placement of large TV sets for comfortable viewing pleasure--- yep. they designed this with real sports fans in mind. no matter where i sit, i can see a multitude of TV's with little blocking my view. so they have it all, and i likey. go here if you're looking for a good bar to watch the superbowl... or any sporting event for that matter. oh, and GO PACK GO!!!~~#~1
Great at first, then the bartender ignored me and my friends for a good 20-30 minutes, put everyones bill on my tab. I opened a tab so this wouldn't happen then they made us wait another 15 for them just to ask us who had what. Then they over charged us by quit a bit. We had to flag someone f=down from napkins and plates and it took a few try's for a water. And to make matters worse my friend got a parking ticket because they took so long. There were three bartenders for what I handle myself at a bar on a daily basis. No sorry from any of them and not even a drip of regret from the manager. He pretty much told us to chill out after this whole 45 min waiting or deal, just to close a check. Kind of a joke really.~~#~1
playing the "poor college student" card here, i went to bookmans with a dvd player, computer speakers, a digi cam, an iflip, and about 90 dvds including some tv sets.they took 4 of my dvds (2 seasons of l word, my nightmare on elm st. video set [including 3d glasses, in great condition - what a find, that bitch cost me $100!!!], and a family guy i think. and they gave me $12. what a load of shit.they took the dvd player, digi cam, and iflip of course. gave me like $33 for those. again, rip.overall, kind of picky as far as what they take, cuz when i was browsing the shelves, lots of the movies i had/was turning weren't on their shelves.so instead, i took all my dvds to mo money pawn shop on 12th and indian school and got 85 big green bitchez. it looks like they have a ton of books, which is pretty cool, but i believe in a system of free literature, aka the library.screw you, bookmans!however, you get three point five stars because not only did i find my favorite lez movie lola, but another great flick by the name of everyday people.~~#~0
Excellent service!!!! I had to find a spa different from lavenders after they got rid of yet another excellent staff member, so I tried this place! I was SO HAPPY!! clean, pleasant, warm, comforting. The manager is actually on site and aware of the things going on in their spa! The staff is friendly and efficient! Lavenders day spa can learn from this place. Send the owner from lavenders to sanity and TAKE NOTES. I HIGHLY recommend it here!!!!!! Go and enjoy!!!~~#~1
Thank goodness someone took over what once was pink taco, aka yuck city, and turned it into something worth stopping in when in Scottsdale. Fox Concepts yet again has made a success and a place I think I will actually return to. To start with we had a delicious plate of cheese and meats from the anti pasta menu, along side with some marinated olives and bread w/ olive oil. Just enough to get our taste buds excited and just enough to have my boyfriend (who is not into fancy smancy stuff) say "give me some more".  These went nicely with our beers (they've got a great list), my mother's martini (which she seemed to enjoy), and my brother's gin on the rocks (he says they carry a gin that is very rare and delicious but the name didn't stick with me-sorry). All of our dinner plates were delicious; fried chicken w/ mashed tatters & biscuits (skin on chicken was a little on the salty side but very crunchy), salmon w/ apple and rice, grilled cheese sliders(who could mess those up?), chicken salad, prime rib dip (served with onion soup instead of au jus, yum yum), and the patato ghesicuto (pasta- I know I can't spell but it was yummy too). Around the table, everyone seemed pretty satisfied.My only criticisms would be that we were seating just to the side of the kitchen, enough to be able to look inside. I dig places that leave it open so you can watch your foot and the chefs are aware that the client is aware of whats going on BUT I did watch one man on the end prepare countless dishes without gloves on. He went from cutting and laying out proscuitto onto creating their carmel kettle corn dessert (scooping with bare hands), to setting out what appeared to be the fondue app. Yes, there can be worse things that happen in a restaurant but as someone who has worked in food service, it made me squirm a bit. I suppose that's why it's called Culinary Dropout....oh, and the music was a bit too loud for me. Great joint for out with friends on the way to the bar or I would think for happy hour but not for a family dinner (my Grandma had to barrow a flashlight from the waitress it was so dark).~~#~0
I live no where near this place & have gone out of my way to eat there MANY times! I haven't been since it moved (bc I had no idea where they went) but it looks like it's bigger so that's great. I even made it a point to take an out of town friend here. I don't know about the new place but the old place was kind of a hole in the wall diner feel (in a good way). It can get really busy at lunch, so I don't recommend it for a lunch break from work. I did that once, and got in and out just fine, but it's a lot more fun without the time crunch. Everything is delicious, but the mini red velvet cupcake is always a must!~~#~1
I like this mall.  It's in a decent location, there are lots of good stores, and the clientele here is bearable.  I've always thought of this mall as just below Scottsdale, but without all the silicone and snobbery.  We went last weekend to kill some time and were a little surprised to see that it was overrun with screaming toddlers.  I guess I should have known that when the AZ temperatures tip past 100 degrees, we have nothing better to do then hang out inside air conditioned malls or hang out inside air conditioned movie theatres, take your pick.  Anyway, the store selection is pretty good here, I just wish they would add a Crate and Barrel and a LUSH, then I would never have to visit Scottsdale again.~~#~0
Quick update for Mama Java's since we had the Yelp Office Hours there last week... we lucked out and were able to take over the couch / chairs to the right when you walk in the door.  It worked out perfectly!  Even though I hadn't been in to MJ in a couple of months, Jensy remembered that I drank a soy latte - incredible!  I felt so special (almost like a regular) when I walked in and she greeted me and asked if I wanted a soy latte!  I did, and it was just as good as last time!The atmosphere provided the perfect place for the yelpers to come and go, chat, etc... I think everyone felt comfortable and welcome.  Thanks again to all of you who came by to visit!  Looking forward to the next time... Lastly, MJ created a yelper special of the day... the "hold me closer tiny yelper' which i believe was a vanilla cinnamon latte.  Now if that didn't make us feel special, what does?!~~#~1
This dog park gets one star.Why?Because the last time I went,some piece of shit broke into just about every car in the parking lot to steal whatever they could.So much broken glass from side windows everywhere.It used to be okay before this incident,but a busy parking lot in borad daylight and some vulture lies in wait?Yeah,I'm done here.~~#~1
It's been a while since I was in Arizona, but I still remember the Olive and Ivy.  I was in Phoenix on a business trip and went out for dinner at this place with a bunch of work people based on a recommendation from a local.  We were not disappointed.  Firstly I want to say that the decor and outdoor area in this place is just fabulous.  We sat outside and enjoyed a delicious meal.  The staff were professional, welcoming and accommodating.  I enjoyed the experience so much that I brought the gf along for dinner when she arrived that weekend.  Both times I was extremely pleased with the food, drink, level of service and the ambience of the place.  5-stars for mine.~~#~1
Great little hole in the wall with authentic New Mexican food.  Chili Relleno was awesome, and the red and green chile was flavorful and spicy.  Rice and beans were good and the sopapilla was delicious. Atmosphere was cozy.  If you want real red and green chile vs. sauce this is the place.~~#~1
I just stopped at Biagio nail place today and got my mani and pedi done, it was fabulous. Tiffany gave me great feet and my neck massage. She does really job. The shellac manicure was really nice she gave me a lots of different colors so she actually helped me find the colors that i like and I was very happy that I got her. I will Go back and ask for her...~~#~1
I just had the ice cream. That was when I didn't know where to go for ice cream. It tasted artificial, much like how everything else looked. There was also a weird feeling about the place - too self-consciously "cute"  suspension of reality - almost as if a crime was imminent like a bad TV show. Looking at the rest of the food was almost disturbing - like school cafeteria food, only worse. Oh well, it discouraged me from eating anything the whole rest of the day.~~#~1
This is one of my favorite places to go in Phoenix!! I love the $5 wine glasses during happy hour!! The bruschetta is out of this world!! The sundae with salted caramel and pretzels is probably one of the BEST things I have ever eaten!! :o)~~#~1
I'm not a huge sushi person (I know, I know...) but I ordered the tuna with lotus chips and it was very yummy. The server was friendly and the chefs were efficient. The atmosphere is dark and modern though a bit squashed and overwhelming.~~#~0
The food in this place is indescribably awesome! Granted, the place could be nicer, but if you're in the mood for great food without the frills of a great looking place: this is it. The service is fast, friendly, and the prices are great- especially knowing that their portions are typically huge. I can't finish my plate most of the time, so I always end up taking leftovers home. I love their Jade Red Chicken, as well as their emerald chicken. Their black beans are to die! Order a combo plate, if this is your first time here. You'll get a good mix of everything and you'll leave without regrets!~~#~1
Ate here the other day with a friend for lunch, it was my first time there.I had the Tom Kha Gai soup, my friend had the Thai fried rice with tofu, each was "Thai hot."  We shared. Scrumptious! The fried rice dish was large. We also shared some mini eggrolls. Mini.I think my soup could've been more dense with lemon grass and cilantro, but it was yummy anyway. I guess it's cuz I'm a sucker for this dish. I think it's much better at Mailee's in Scottsdale but you pay 5 bucks more.The place is spartan, not fancy, has some damage, looks like what you would expect by looking at the outside. I'm not picky as long as the place isn't a complete dump. Thai restaurants for me don't have to be princess palaces.... I've enjoyed Char's for years, and it showed its age but wasn't in a state of disrepair.They have some beers on hand as well.The menu has a variety of curries, which I look forward to trying.I'd like to try this place again, I just don't have much more to say at the moment other than I spied a few dishes on their way to their enjoyers, and they looked appealing.Convenient location. Worth a try, not bad. You know if it was I'd tell you.Give it a try for weekday lunch, they have a lunch special menu.~~#~0
everything, everyone has posted about this company is true! great service, friendly people, good pricing! highly recommend!~~#~1
Could be because I've never met a bowl of pho I didn't like, but I could slurp this stuff up all day.  Viet Kitchen does a decent job with their pho; the broth is so delicious and soothing. I have only ever gotten pho at all the Vietnamese restaurants I've been to, and here's what I didn't like about Viet Kitchen's: the chicken is somewhat dry and tasteless.  The broth has a ton of flavor, so when you eat a piece of chicken with the broth it is fine. But to eat it alone, is way too plain. All they need to do is season it up a bit before cooking it. Also, the spring rolls were very fresh and great dipped in the sauce. Without the sauce, they would have been a bit dry, too. Overall, this is my go-to place for pho since it is so close to my house.~~#~0
I don't love the coffee at Starbucks, but this place is getting 5 stars for their service! They are quick, ACCURATE, friendly, and they always remember my drink even though I only go there about once a week! Amazing! The staff is great and I thought I should leave them a nice little "Good Job" on Yelp!~~#~1
Great dive bar. Great jukebox~~#~0
This place was incredible.  The staff was friendly, not pretentious, and very knowledgable. I don't know what it was called, but our group ordered a tray which was a sampler platter and had a bit of everything on it.  So fresh!  We also tried the sushi with the caviar on top.  Try the sake that they recommend (flown in from Japan - they are the only ones in PHX that carry it).  I'm not a sake fan but I loved it.  That's how good it was.~~#~1
Monkey Pants has some of the best burgers in AZ.  Great place for a long lazy lunch over some pitchers.  I think one month my friends and I went there like 20 times for lunch.  Never got sick of it.  It's a dive bar, but it's a cool dive bar.~~#~1
We were in town for the weekend and I had a cigar at this lounge.  The cigar prices are reasonable and I didnt mind paying $9 for a La Gloria Wavelle.  Service was good and the atmosphere was nice and chill.  My Wife doesnt smoke cigars and the air circulation was good, no lingering smoke.  We met some nice people and the lounge singers were a plus.  We will come back next time we visit, I wish we had something like this in LA.~~#~1
you want a hotel, what really matters?Cleanliness!!!  5 stars.Friendly staff.And they got the really good cylindrical candies... mmmmm.  ok, now that we got that out of the way.... some funky odors in one of the hallways and elevator at one end of the hall was out of order our entire stay.i would come back though.  solid price performer.~~#~0
If you like the stuck up Scottsdale vibe this is a good place for you. The food isn't impressive. Nice outdoor seating.~~#~1
Where else can you get fresh lemon grass, fresh pork uterus, and avocado ice cream?  Asian markets are the bomb, but Lee Lee's is the BOMB DIGGETY since they have EVERYTHING.  Jamaican, Cuban, Vietnamese, Korean, Indian, Lebanese---you name it.If you love to cook (and I do, I really do!) you can seriously spend hours here.  ONE CAVEAT:  The seafood is fresher and better at 99 Ranch on 44th St. in Phoenix.Last week, they were giving a 10% discount off of your grocery bill and a free bottle of fish sauce or soy sauce.  If you spent over a certain amount, you got a big bag of rice.Go!  Now!And have lunch in the Vietnamese restaurant attached.~~#~1
This is my FAVORITE place to dine out in the greater Phoenix area. The food (I recommend the steaks) is almost as good as the view and the service is impeccable. My boyfriend took me here on a date a year ago, and it was definitely one of the most romantic restaurants we have found in Phoenix yet. The prices are a little high ($25 - $40 per entree), but it's well worth it and you won't leave disappointed. If you like American or French food (who doesn't?) and have a special occasion or just feel like doing something different, I highly recommend Different Pointe of View to everyone!~~#~1
Well....it is what you can expect from airport food.  Not that great but not terrible.  All I wanted was a simple sandwhich to take on the plane with me.  This airport does not have the best in choices, Starbucks, Wendys, Pizza Hut, etc.  This little place is literally a kiosk in terminal C.  It is good if you are in a rush and just want something cold for later.~~#~0
Dropped into this joint just wandering around Old Town Scottsdale. Ordered the nachos and had a couple margs. WOW. The staff was friendly, have a great sense of humor (you gotta see the posted picture joke in person), and the food is...beyond good. Having only sampled the uber nacho plate, which is by the way, as big as a platter and slathered in layers of ooey gooey cheesy goodness, I can definitively say: Best. Ever. I give this place the highest marks for "doesn't suck"~~#~1
If you ever want to instantly "up" your cool factor with a friend or date, meet them at the Lost Leaf. The mere fact that there is no external sign (other than the tacky "open" sign indicating that it is, indeed, the lost leaf) you would probably never have any idea that the best neighborhood bar in Phoenix is inside. When i am asked to describe the lost leaf to someone who has never been before, it is basically a big open house with the most well-stocked beer fridge you have ever seen.No cocktails or draft, but for atmosphere and quality of beer selection, lost leaf is by far my favorite place to meet people in dtown phoenix.~~#~1
This is my favorite restaurant in the Phoenix area. There, I wrote it...and I am sticking to it. First off -- fresh local, sustainable, organic are not just words on the menu and the website. Now, in places like San Francisco and NYC, this would be nothing notable, but in the desert, it is truly something hard to find. Aside from the practical, in the land of Fox Restaurants (True aside) and the big box store at the strip mall, there really appears to be little demand for a small, local restaurant on a farm. It's time to make new demands! It's time to say no to the next Zinburgergeist and try that little corner place run by your neighbor...but I digress. We enjoyed the Farmer's Feast and it was worth every penny of the $65/person. First, the house cured meats, including the head cheese, were amazing. Second, how often do you get a chef's menu where each person's plate is different? Not often. Ultimately we each tried 10 different items. And each item, was amazing. I would come back for the pasta alone, let along the perfectly cooked scallops, and melt in your mouth sliced fillet. The service was ideal. If you want to eat in 60 minutes, don't come here, but if you want to enjoy in evening of great food, do come here. I noted to the waiter that the previous night they had sturgeon -- something I haven't seen on a menu since N. California. I commented on how unique it is, etc...Of course, it was not available on the night I was there...or was it? When it came to our fish course, the waiter brought out sturgeon for me. The restaurant didn't have enough to have it on the menu, but the waiter clearly put in a special request on my behalf and made the effort to make a diner happy. Maybe if I offer to work on the farm I can eat for free...~~#~1
Matt's was absolutely fantastic. Got there at 2pm on a Sunday, which is apparently the time to do it (half an hour before close), as we walked right in, sat right down, and had food in 5 minutes or less. Brilliant.I had the Five Spot which was simply the best egg sandwich I have ever had. Two eggs, two huge slices of perfectly cooked bacon, american cheese (my favorite with eggs when I'm not going fancy-style, reminds me of when I was a kid), and well grilled onions round it out, served on a fantastic roll. By default, this item doesn't include the normal potatoes and toast, so I had them add homefries--they were magnificent, and entirely unnecessary. A huge portion of them, with a wonderful smattering of rosemary to punch them up, they were delicious, but I couldn't finish them.The girlfriend got a waffle with bacon and it should just be said that restaurants who serve waffles without real maple syrup are simply criminal. Matt's brings the good stuff, and it's MUCH appreciated. Perfect for dipping both waffle and bacon alike. The waffle was fluffy, light, and had that good, homemade flavor.I can't get over how filling and delicious my sandwich was. Service was prompt and friendly, and overall, it was a great experience. Added a glass of OJ and a coffee to my sandwich with added homefries and her bacon and waffles bringing our tab to right about $21. Absolutely worth every penny. Will be coming back. Probably near 2 o'clock again, to avoid the wait!~~#~1
This is by far the best Chicken Fried Steak around!  Not to mention their mashed potatoe's, salad and biscuit!  I've never been able to clean my plate here, which is great since I always have an extra meal!   Of course you can always get the lunch portion which is smaller, but then you don't have the extra goodies for later!  It's a small down home place, dress comfy and go there to eat up!  The wait staff is always the best and they know their stuff!  I've had their T-Bone here, and it's good, but really hard to go there and not get what made them famous!  Wonderful food!Prices for lunch are around $7.00 and dinner around $12.00 - really hard to beat for real down home cooking!~~#~1
I love the place.  Was a bit hesitant at first but friends recommended it, and it turned out to be quite good.  They even have a few choices for those that aren't into Asian fare.~~#~1
I like the way they treat my dogs, really friendly staff.  They are really good about getting your pet seen in an emergency.  The facility itself is nice.  However, it feels as if they are always trying to sell me something things I don't need. This place is so expensive, we can never get out of there for less than $100.~~#~0
I ate here once while Crudo was still in its Scottsdale location.  And I raved about it and vowed to come back (although the strange location in a salon delayed that return).  Then Crudo disappeared.  And I wondered how a place that fed me one of my best meals in Phoenix could disappear in a town supposedly full of foodies.  Now it has reappeared, and in a better location.  Oh joy.~~#~1
BEST RESTAURANT IN AZ! No but seriously, I could eat every meal here. Chef Becky is amazing and breakfast this morning did not disappoint. I decided to try the Organic Oatmeal and my friend ordered the Red Velvet pancakes. Ok, so you're probably saying "with all that yummy goodness you ordered oatmeal?" Well, what I really wanted were the chilequiles (eggs, cotija jack, pulled pork, tortillas, tomatillo verde? Yes please!!) but being allergic to eggs I went with the oatmeal, which was delicious. The oatmeal had a vanilla flavor to it and the strawberry and pecan topping gave it some texture. The red velvet pancakes are too intense for words. Rich, fluffy...they'll make you want to get up early on a Saturday morning. I also tried a side order of the banana bread which was slightly toasted....now if you've never toasted banana bread, you need to. This was the perfect buttery flavor combination with the oatmeal.  The service was fast as always--we never had to wait or ask for a coffee/water refill. The decor inside is warm but I think sitting outside on the patio is the way to go. Love the Herb Box and can't wait to go back and try the cinnamon buckwheat pancakes.~~#~1
This review can be applied to any and all Quick Trip locations.  I have, on many occasions, gone out of my way to stop in QT over other gas stations, because not only are they much much nicer, but they are very clean and offer a ton of gas station fare (drinks, shakes, coffees, juices, snacks, etc).  I really appreciate how quickly they work, with cashier's that are able to take care of two customers at once.  I usually abhor using gas station bathrooms because, let's face it, we've all been there and seen how putrid they can be, but whenever I visit QT they are always clean! They mop, sweep, clean the bathrooms, windex the doors...and for that I applaud you all, thanks for the cleanliness:D~~#~1
What a place!  I recently hosted a 25-person family party there, and both the food and service were impeccable.  The staff were all very friendly and accommodating, even with the dozen children we had in the group.  Leslie was the manager and she paid attention to every last detail, helping me to plan the menu and gauge food quantities for that many people.  The restaurant itself was spotless, from the outside patio down to the restrooms.  Thanks for making our family event such a wonderful success.  Everyone left full and happy.  We will definitely be back!!~~#~1
Oh my God, Chompie's is the bomb and I'm so happy to have a location so close to my house!While this location has a steady customer base, I have never had to wait longer then five minutes to be seated, unlike the other location at 92nd Street, Win! Service has always been fantastic. Quick on to seat, quick to get drinks, quick on refills, and delicious food from breakfast to dinner items. As other reviewers have stated, the Jewish sliders are amazing, but I have also enjoyed different wraps and sandwiches. Prices are a little higher, but the food is well worth the money. There is a "bar area" with about six stools and two TV's that you are able to see from your tables/booths which usually has ESPN on. The restaurant itself is all decked out in a NYC theme, well lit, but the acoustics aren't that great so it can get a little noisy. Bathrooms are nice and always clean. Oh, and don't forget to check out their bakery for delicious goodies to take home!~~#~1
Great sushi place!  Ample portions of sashimi.  Unagi is the best I've had.  And don't forget the Tako salad.  The atmosphere is okay.  It's not bad, but not exactly cool.  Of course, if it were 4 miles south (in Old Town Scottsdale), you'd never get a table.~~#~1
Careful! You'll get addicted.Angel Sweet is the best gelato this side of Italy.The pana cotta and zupa flavors are to die for. Don't settle for just one either, you can get as many flavors as will fit in your cup!~~#~1
I can't believe I hadn't been here before yesterday!  Talk about a hidden gem!  I was taking a friend around to cross stuff off her "List of Stuff to do Before the World Ends" and smoking a hookah happened to be on it.  Therefore I googled places nearby us and Oasis popped up.As soon as we got there the guy at the door welcomed us in with a smile and opened the door for us and once inside the waitress/bartender helped us pick a table and took our drink orders.  We decided to get the peach hookah and an order of the Hummus and Pita Deluxe with beef.  The food was delicious and the hookah was great!  The staff was awesome the entire night as well.  Everyone kept checking on us to see if we needed anything and they would just stop and chat with us as well.  One guy was even helping my friend try to make smoke circles!  I definitely love that they're open until 4 am on Fridays and Saturdays too because it's always nice to have somewhere to wind down after all the bars close!~~#~1
So Chase field you get 3 stars.Here's the problem(s) I have with the venue or CONS so to speak.1. Cash Only almost EVERYWHERE, for a stadium named after a bank, don't you think someone would have taken finacial practice into better concern, perhaps CHASE just wants to sucker you more by making you pay their ATM fees if your not a member which I see as "Greedy Fat Cat" practices. 2. No real options in regards to "regular" ball park food, the Brats are a joke and at 6 bucks a pop, they don't even offer peppers and onions, strange that it shows it in the menu picture. Other than that it's just another typical "let's capitalize all we can" with your typical crap chains (Fridays, Panda Express, etc) which I find pretty disgusting.  3. The "Value" beer stands..... Okay, when is a beer a "value" at 4 dollars, I mean  seriously, being that I just paid 6 bucks for a brat that's pretty pathetic I'd at least like the decency of having a good size beer to help wash down the piss boiled frank I just overpaid the crap out of for. To sum it up, the value beer is tiny and the only one worth buying IMO is the 9 dollar 24 ouncer or even better, the 10.50 Corona, HA.Here's the PROS.1. Damn good deal on seating prices, we sat in section 140 (lower level outfield) for 15 bucks a person, Not too shabby! 2. The stadium is rather beautiful, for a stadium that is. 3. There's a pool in the outfield, cool idea 4. Parking is rather cheap (12 bucks) and has never seemed to be an issue.5. Traffic control before and after games is surprisingly smooth Overall 3 stars, I just think they need more originality instead of what "Joe Sixpack" wants while charging him Paris Hilton prices.~~#~0
This Jack in the Box location has the worst service & food that I have found in the Phoenix metro area. Every time I have gone through the drive through there my order has either been wrong or inedible - how hard is it to make a taco without frying it into oblivion? The wait times are consistently more than 5 minutes...I think I will be spending that 5 minutes driving to another location, just to get the correct order & food that is properly prepared.~~#~1
My meal at FnB last weekend was one of the best I've had in Arizona. I love everything about this place, the food, the cocktails, the staff, the atmosphere.It was a rainy Sunday. I knew the restaurant was right next to Cowboy Ciao, but managed to walk right by it (my friends noticed me go by). I turned back, and Pavle was nice enough to wait at the door, and said "Ben?" as I was about to pass by again. I agree with what everyone else said here, Pavle really makes you feel at home.I started with the slivered fennel salad and a ginhound. I split the order with a friend, and they were more than happy to bring the salad split  onto two plates for us. I love citrus, and these were a very refreshing start to my meal. Next up was the trout. It was presented stacked on top of the sunchokes and caramelized onions, with some wonderful broth on the plate. The combination of flavors was rich, and amazing, and the presentation ensured that every bite was as good as the last. I could eat this every visit, but I sampled the chicken and lamb, and was just as blown away. For desert I had lemon cake with ice cream and strawberry compote. FnB has been receiving a lot of positive buzz lately. It's well deserved. If you haven't visited yet, you're missing out.~~#~1
Got a padi and the tech stopped for a while to eat. then i got a new tech to finish my pedi. my total was different than the quoted price. when paying my total was $25 i hanede them a $50 and they cashier tried to keep all the change for a tip. he refused to give me my change until i told him that is not gon to happen. My feet were so dry afterwards. I DO NOT recommend them~~#~1
So my coworkers and I decide we want donuts on a Weds. I know typically donuts are on Fridays but what the hay. In my search for a really good donut I go to the Internet and Google "best donuts" and low and behold Bosa Donuts comes up. They have 3 locations, and the one in Chandler has 12 reviews, which all raved about how great Bosa Donuts were. So I notice they have a location at 35th Ave and Glendale! I had seen it many times but never stopped in thinking it was just the average run of the mill donut shop. Boy was I wrong! Bosa Donuts is by far the best donut I have had in a very long time, maybe ever! I stopped by for a dozen this morning and bought a little something special for myself. I got to the car and took one bite and was in heaven. The what I would call a Cinnamon Fry with crumb topping was to die for. What I liked the most was it was not greasy like some other donut shops. (I won't mention any names, you know who you are!) Lightly crisp on the outside and so tender on the inside. The crumb topping was just the icing on the cake. It was all I could do not stop and get some milk so I could utterly devour the rest of my donut on the way to work. I did have a bite of an Apple Fitter after getting to work and it was very yummy too. They have many varieties and some wonderfully looking croissants too. If you have not tried Bosa Donuts in Phoenix you are missing out!~~#~1
Papago has a great beer selection & awesome food. Try the Orange Blossom!!~~#~1
YUM!I can never remember what it is, but order the salad thing on pita bread!  It will change your life!  My co-workers and I would always go in here and share one of those and then we'd each get a slice of pizza.  Perfect amount of food- low prices- never too/disgustingly full.  Their bilinis are wonderful as well!~~#~1
Best Italian restaurant in the valley, as far as I'm concerned. Totally unassuming from the outside since it's in a strip center on 64th St. & Greenway (in the same center as Fry's and McDonalds). But this family run restaurant that has been here for years. Same friendly staff every time...especially love being in the bar area. A little on the pricey side, but definitely worth it. Must try the ravioli (either as an appetizer or main dish) and chicken Marsala with fettuccine Alfredo on the side. All entrees come with soup or salad.~~#~1
Yelpers,  have a question. If menus and prices vary by location, help this CA transplant figure out the best ones to try! Thanks, I've heard such good things about Sonic but have only been to the Anaheim and Hemet, CA ones while visiting.~~#~1
Descent food, of course it's not autentico. Free chips, salsa, & wifi though.~~#~0
May I add "family friendly" to my past reviews? We love this place because we feel like we are home when we come here. The staff is kind and they always welcome us with open arms. The manager, Kaj, literally treats us like family. We brought our new born baby to Corbin's for her first meal out, and we were thrilled with the level of service we received, as usual. The food is excellent, and the service is divine. The happy hour is awesome! My favorite items are the quesedillas, burgers, feta and hot sauced topped homemade potato chip appetizer, and the excellent selection of beers. Corbins is just an overall  great place!~~#~1
While throwing a small get together, we were able to have a back patio with a buffet style table set up with some pretty tasty appetizers.  The chicken sqewers were delicious and smoked salmon was also tasty but something seemed to lack.  At the end of the day it was good and I wouldn't hesitate to go back, but nothing to make me a raving fan.~~#~0
E-Z Buffet is a Chinese buffet that recently opened in my neighborhood.  It was about $10 for dinner .  The place had a bunch of tables so seating was easy.   You can also get take out.They have a lot of food to choose from, typical Chinese fare plus sushi, fried chicken wings, roast beef, salad fixings, pudding & fruit.  They also had ice cream for desert, not soft serve but hard ice cream.  I like the General Tso's Chicken, Scallion Pork and their freshly steamed green beans.  I loved their rocky road ice cream. The wait staff was prompt and friendly.  I really liked that.This place is worth trying.  If you go please write a review.  I'd love to know what others think.~~#~0
I always feel a sense of guilt having to write a less than stellar review after meeting the owner of a restaurant. Lucia was Beautiful and sweet, and a pleasure to meet, my lunch, however, was not fit to eat. I ordered the THE HUMM-DINGER VEGAN WRAP: Roasted artichoke, zucchini, red bell pepper, onion, fresh spinach and hummus with a balsamic reduction drizzle, with a side of fruit and the sun dried tomato wrap. Notice it says "Roasted", the cashier told me the Veggies were "Grilled". Unfortunately, to my dismay, they were neither. Everything inside was heated up, by either stove or microwave, I'd guess the latter, and the "Sun Dried Tomato Wrap" was thin, doughy and utterly flavorless, not to mention a shocking pink color, which I'm sure was due to being naturally colored with beet juice, but did not help make things anymore appetizing. The fruit was a soggy pile of your typical pre-cut cantaloupe, honey dew mix. It was not what I was expecting AT ALL, when I think of a grilled veggie wrap, I imagine tasting all those veggies bursting with flavor after caramelizing on the grill, they had no flavor though. I also did not expect the temperature to be Hot, chilled would have been better in my opinion if the veggies had actually bee grilled that is. This lunch to me was less than average and as I sat there will my full plate in front of me I was asked how my meal was, I clearly stated my concerns as I have here and was simply told that it was a "Best Seller". Lucia did send over a piece of chocolate cake, which was appreciated, but unfortunately missed the mark since I'm Vegan and the desserts aren't. Honestly, in my opinion, aside from the market, most of the menu items are anything but healthy. The 3 stars is for the market, my food would have been 1.And that folks is why I am the Lunch Snob!~~#~0
I was extremely happy that we chose Cool Cuts 4 Kids for my son's first big boy hair cut. He was instantly comfortable and drawn in by all of the friendly things they have for children. He was given the choice of a movie or playing a video game, of course knowing exactly what he wants went straight for the video game (Sonic on XBOX). It was pretty much a breeze from that point the little guy was hypnotized and didn't even realize what was going on w/ his beautiful, lovely long hair =( obviously they need to focus on distracting the mom's lol! Jessie who cut my sons long hair was a doll, she didn't seem to be bothered by the mother breathing down her neck as she hacked off my little's hair or the boyfriend taking a copious amount of pictures and video of the whole event. In the end my son looked great and I was a happy mama, I couldn't have asked for a better experience.~~#~1
Amanda at Butterfly Petals did the flowers for my wedding. I didnt want to spend  a lot on them and shaved it down to only needing my bouquet, three boutonnieres and two corsages. I told her what I liked and didnt and my budget. She created a bunch of options for me based on my specifics so I had a  number of choices. She also did all of this via email. which I give her total kudos for. On the day of my wedding, there was a fabulous bouquet waiting for me as well as perfect corsages and boutonnieres for my groom and our parents. Amanda waited for me, even though I was terribly late, to make sure I was happy with her creations which really gave a personal touch.Butterfly Petals is creative and affordable. I love my bouquet so much that I ended up keeping it and I am having it preserved!~~#~1
I loved this casual dining experience at the gorgeous Phoenician.  I stopped in for happy hour with some friends, and we had a great time.  We sat in front of the fireplace and sipped beers over appetizers.  The location alone is worth going for, but the food was good and service was even better.~~#~1
I purchased a pair of Naot Paris sandals ($160 with tax) at The Shoe Mill.  I considered buying on-line, but decided to shop locally instead.  I ended up paying more, but assumed that I was paying for the superior service.  I wore my new shoes to work on Friday.  By the end of the day, I had developed blisters on both feet near my toes and my ankles.  I was surprised because I had read many reviews stating how comfortable Naot sandals are and the salesman who helped me confirmed that I was buying the correct size.  Sadly, I took them back to the store the next day.  To my surprise, I was told that The Shoe Mill does not take returns.  I have never tried to return shoes, so it didn't occur to me to ask this question when I made the purchase.  However, as I stated, I expected full service from a high end shoe store.I will no longer shop at The Shoe Mill.  It's been three days and my feet are still recovering.  It's a constant reminder of how dissatisfied I was with my purchase.  I will definitely shop Zappos next time.~~#~1
This place has the best wraps I've ever had.  The smoothie's are good as well, but I go here because of the wraps.~~#~1
I stopped by a Friday morning a few months past and have been meaning to write a review. I've had donuts since then from other donut shops, but none compare to Bosa. The price and quality at Bosa are far superior to all others. You can't go wrong with the donut holes.~~#~1
Amazing place wish i lived in Phx so i could have this EVERYDAY!~~#~1
One of my favorite places to eat if I'm looking for cheap and fast :)~~#~1
Stopped in and tried both their sweet potato fries and zucchini fries. Much fonder of the sweet potatoes & the others were a little heavy?!   Like previous posts I was not to fond of their dipping sauces either.Loved their freshly prepared lemonade and the great outside spot to people watch!~~#~0
I love this place. Just to hang out on a Summer day on the patio and have a beer is like...the perfect day. The food is awesome. The Kilt Lifter is tasty and thirst quenching. The area is definitely lucky to have such a place.~~#~1
Once again, THE TROUGH SLURPERS offer far too many stars to this mundane eatery, proving again that they are truly CANAILLE of the first order.:Slow indifferent serviceMediocre foodThe kind of wine that patrons of kokopelli swill with delight, calling it ambrosia when it's actually dishwater.But..as with Kokopelli, it keeps the shit eaters out of the better restaurants! So, I say to you canaille..flock, flock there with your disruptive screaming children and your leathery palates.~~#~1
Yes... I love Eegee's... I have to admit it could be a bit of a problem for me as I drove from Chandler to Casa Grande just for an eegee and sammich in the worse rush hour traffic. If that isn't love I don't know what is because we all know Arizona drivers are ... well you know. I always get the pina colda mixed with lemon eegee and a grinder / or turkey sub and don't forget the ranch fries! The one is Casa Grande is new and clean not that I can say the same for the ones in Tucson.~~#~1
Yelp pointed me to this place while on a business trip-- looking for good pizza in the area.  Kind of a mixed result.  The restaurant is located in a strip mall, sort of hidden in one of the back corners.  Walk in thinking fast food, but turns out it's sit down.  Why does it seem all the burger and pizza joints in this area are sit down-- odd...  Anyway, I got three slices.  Quality was ok-- a bit doughy and filling, I couldn't make it through all three.  Lots of free refills was a nice touch on a 105 degree day.  Staff were really friendly, and, oh yeah-- it was cheap!   Less than 6 bucks for more pizza than I could eat and bottomless coke.  So, great value, nice service, just ok pizza, though.~~#~0
I will say that the weakest link in this restaurant is the maturity of the staff.  We went for lunch and asked to sit on the patio.  Most of the people we're eating but then they sat a large group right next to us that only wanted to drink and smoke.  I know smoking it allowed on the patio but since it wasn't the only table available AND the rest of us we're eating food I think they should have sat them a little farther away from us.Our order wasn't right but couldn't get the server to come back so we just let it go.  The food was great!  Had a few items from the small plates and then we had the bacon grilled cheese and the chicken sandwich.  Both very good.  My biggest complaint is that we we're ignored unless we we're actively looking around for someone and then snagged someone as they walked by.  I will try again as this place is still trying to find its way but service needs to be stepped up for sure.~~#~0
I used to go here at least 3 times a week for Happy hour.  The volcano chicken was my favorite meal.  However, the last time I was in there I had a cricket in my water.  I took a sip squeezed the lemon, and thought there was something wrong with the taste.  I checked and at first thought it was a lemon seed but no, sure enough it was a cricket (in which i took a picture).  The way this restaurant handled an insect in my water was repulsive.  One of the male bartenders came over and brought a new water saying, "It happens."  No, sorry that's disgusting.  If i hadn't been craving the volcano chicken I went there for I would have just left.  And then on top of getting a cricket in my water there's no discount or compensation off of my bill.~~#~1
I went here with Friends last Friday.  All my friends and I use Yelp, at the end of the meal taking cost into perspective we all came to this is a 1 star place.  It was a huge disappointment after looking at the positive reviews.  Our 1st disappointment came because they had a "limited" beer list.  My good buddy just wanted an IPA and all they had was the normal domestic beers and a few other quality ones.  Then, the Spanish ham was not very good and once you take into account the price it was terrible.  We had a sausage plate where the sausage was dry.  The Calamari was extremely oily.  The only positive thing was the lamb chops but once you factor in price that was poor too.  We all came to the conclusion we would never go back.~~#~1
Totally worth the drive from Scottsdale. The food is delicious, and is not pre-packaged, such a nice change for a coffee joint. Support local business, Starbucks has nothing on Lux; other than a million locations.~~#~1
Lately, I've been on the hunt for a good shrimp po boy. I'm not sure if this compulsion was spurred by homesickness for New Orleans, the food challenge show featuring 2 famous NOLA po boy joints, or both but I've it seems the last few weekends I've found myself dreaming of that crusty bread "dressed" with lettuce, tomato, and mayo, and golden deep fried gulf shrimp. I happened to notice Baby K's one day and decided to try it out. To be honest, I wasn't even really that hungry but I wanted the po boy and I didn't know when or if I'd have the opportunity to go back to Town and Country mall any time in the near future. The inside was empty but they have a FrenchQuarter-esque patio complete with wrought iron fence. The bf and I both ordered the half pb with a cup of gumbo. I'm a bit of a gumbo snob bc I feel I can make it better than any restaurant can but theirs was really good! They had 3 different kinds which was nice and it was seasoned perfectly. There wasn't a bite that didn't have meat in and the broth was just right. The shrimp on the pb was succulent and almost tasted as if it was battered in beignet mix as the fried was light and airy. I didn't indulge in any libations but they do have Abita and a few other New Orleans beer classics. If I find myself in the area again I'd probably go back but this time I'm ordering a whole po boy!~~#~0
Met some friends here for happy hour the other day.  This is the old El Paso BBQ and they did a knockout job with the remodel. Great feel and warm colors to the place now.I had a couple of Coronas and some chips and guacamole.  The regular menu looks better than the happy hour menu and think I'll try them the next time for lunch or dinner.~~#~0
The management thanked me profusely for my input on Yelp and graciously invited me to return as a guest to show me the true Latilla Experience. I was told changes have been made because of reading my YELP review.The changes are that dinner portions are more ample than before, the appetizer plate share charge is gone now and I noticed the web site has been updated. This visit showed little resemblance to the service I had last time. A full staff was on with staff working in sync as a team with all the tables not just mine.I was even more blown away with the food than the last time due to perhaps I picked foods that were more suiting to me some highs were-Beet salad- it was similar to others I had in other places but this one also had HOUSE GROWN BEETS ,Riesling soaked pears and the toasted hazelnuts made the salad  pop with flavor. Foraged mushroom rissotto-correctally made with a depth of flavor, it was good on it's own but this had an added embellishment of a SIXTY TWO DEGREE duck egg. Nicely seasoned and prepared fresh branzino sat on top of ribbon cut caponata, an unusual surprise was the vinaigrette and the ribbon cut string less celery that was very good. We also enjoyed the Kobe Flap steak with wine reduction and tiny marble size multi color potatoes and tasty spinach.Since we skipped the interesting desserts last time we had to try one this time and tried the chocolate hazelnut cake with jam-figs and mascarpone gelato this dessert was garnished with a chocolate sort of lavender crisp and roasted hazelnuts. This dessert was something Iron chef worthy for sure with all the flavors working well together.The service we had was phenomenal.The food at Latilla is masterfully done, the surroundings are majestic and breathtaking. The meal we had wasn't ordinary it was extraordinary!~~#~1
5 stars for bein the only bar in Phoenix where I was first scared to order a drink. but- thats why I love this place. That, and its near the Trunk Space.~~#~1
Lux is a great place for coffee, bakery items, bites, and even cocktails if the occasion permits. The people are friendly, and it has a great atmosphere.I love coming here in the afternoon for a cup of their Americano, which is pretty damn top-notch. As I don't live in AZ, if I'm going to be away for an extended period of time, I'm always sure to take a bag of their freshly-roasted coffee beans from wherever with me.I was there last week on a Sunday afternoon having some darn good mimosas with a friend, and it wasn't too crowded.The only downside I've experienced is it can be a bit confusing where to order for food and cocktails during the day.If you go for the first time, don't be shy. Grab a cup of coffee and explore. As one of the earlier reviewers mentioned, you might get looks walking in like you shouldn't be there. Maybe it's your hair. Maybe you're displaying something that's not eco-friendly. Whatever, dude. Be brave, press on. It's worth it.~~#~1
I was in the middle of a dilemma and needed proof of something faxed to me right away and stopped in here and got what i needed within just five minutes and was outta there and back to what i needed to take care of.  The price for two piece of paper for the fax was almost $3, which while is not the cheapest considering you can get it for free at home, but beggars cannot be choosers and was happy to pay it.~~#~1
Styles of pizza can be so different. I have a hard time comparing a place like Boombozz to Grimaldi's. At Grimaldi's, they refuse to carry ranch because they don't want people dipping their pizza in it. At Boombozz, they offer ranch as soon as they set down the pizza.So no, Boombozz is definitely not the best pizza that I've ever had, but for their style of pizza, they are pretty good. Think traditional Domino's/Papa John's type crust with stepped-up, unique toppings and sauce. My husband said the crust tasted like a cheesy breadstick, and I think that's a pretty accurate description. We got the D'Sienna with an interesting tomato cream sauce, spinach, and tomatoes. The low quality cheese detracted from it overall, but it was still much better than the pizza at Oregano's.Boombozz is relatively new to town, but they seem to know their crowd well. It was pretty busy when we visited midweek. Big menu, lots of drink specials, TVs everywhere, ample seating... everything a chain restaurant needs to succeed. I'm sure we'll be back when we're eating with finicky family members who are too scared to eat anything ethnic.~~#~0
My mom had purchased a Groupon for this place back in March and yesterday we were all deciding what sounded good for lunch. I suggested Mexican so then we were thinking which Mexican restaurant sounded good. (Living in AZ, you know there's MANY to choose from) So my mom suggested going to Blue Adobe so all of us headed there. My mom, my dad, my sister, my nephew, and I all thoroughly enjoyed our meals. I had the Triple Stack of New Mexican style Enchiladas. One shredded beef and two Carne Adovada. It was SO delicious! The red sauce at Blue Adobe is unparalleled and unlike any other. My dad had the Chorizo stuffed Chicken Breast and loved it. My mom had the seafood enchiladas with halibut salmon and shrimp and she inhaled those. And my sister had the Chile Rellenos and couldn't stop saying how tasty they were. And my 5 year old nephew loved his kids cheese enchilada. Our server was named Travis and he was great as well. Phenomenal service. Even if Travis had been sub-par, I would still give this place 5 Stars because that's just how good the food is.~~#~1
This place is excellent.  Hands down, the best tacos I've had.  Fresh and flavorful meats and great salsas.  I see people raving about some of the "salsa bars" at all of the 'berto's and such but the salsa there is like water compared to what Tacos Atoyac has to offer.  They care about what they are serving and take pride in their craft.If you like the style of food here you must try Sonora Mesquite Grill on 46th Street and Thomas.~~#~1
I totally love this place. It reminds me of the old school hardcore Chinese restaurant my parents used to take us when we were kids :D The decor is amazing- unlike more Chinese places in Phoenix. The walls are a teal blue, adorned with large carved pieces of artwork depicting scenes in China, golden dragons and more. The lights hanging from the ceiling are amazingly ornate. The place looks like its from a bygone era (doesn't help that its in a run down strip mall) but it is clean and charming inside.The service was great- kind to our 2 yo, and very attentive. The food was the best part- I can't remember the last time I had such good Chinese food, and it's priced very reasonably. We got the Peking dinner for 2 which included the fried noodles, hot tea, wonton soup (with generous noodles, meat, shrimp and veggies, the best I've ever had), a pupu platter with eggrolls, bbq skewers, house wings and those cheese puff thingies (the presentation is pretty cool, too). Next came 3 entree sized plates of food: mongolian beef, fried chicken (can't remember the name) and the Peking fried rice. The meal concluded with incredible little desserts- sort of like eggrolls but filled with banana and then covered with crystalized honey. I could have eaten 100 of them! Adding in a beverage and tax, the meal was only $34! My 2 yo can really eat, so I am surprised and pleased to say that even with sharing the dinner for 2 people with him, the 3 of us walked out with lots of leftovers. Highly recommended. Do it! DO IT!~~#~1
OVERPRICED & DECEITFUL & RUDE!I should have read the reviews before I came here! I took a bridesmaid dress in to have the top taken in like 1/4 inch, not much. I asked her, how much will this cost? She assured me it would not be "much". It was $60 and she hardly did a thing, can't even steam it there. I was irate but calmly asked her if she could charge less and she screamed NO! She said it's because the dress cost more. Yeah...like that matters A guy was there dropping off pants that needed taken OUT which is a lot more work, she charge him $18.50 for each pair. I don't know if that is good for pants a lot but her pricing scale seems way off!Previously I've been to 5th Avenue Alterations and they charge me $50 for a floor length brdiesmaid dress that they took in the whole thing AND steamed it. They're also polite and will work with you on pricing and communicate with you beforehand. Definitely worth the few extra minutes of a drive!!~~#~1
Great prices and service. The delivery process could be improved but for the price and peace of mind with the Costco warranty process you cant go wrong. High quality furniture and very low prices.~~#~1
I have been going here for years.  The staff is always very pleasant, the place is nice and clean and they offer a variety of services.  I also like the $5 kids haircuts on certain days.  Overall, a top notch establishment.~~#~1
I have been going to Salon Mila for 12 years.  I will never go anywhere else.  My hair always looks amazing when I leave.  The color and cut are always perfect!  I feel glamorous and beautiful when I leave.  First class salon!  Beautiful surroundings!  Always great service!  They aim to please!  Mila knows what it takes to make sure her customers feel welcome all the time!  Thanks everyone!~~#~1
Buca Di Beppo is literally, italian restaurant hell. You know how all big box chain restaurants throw junk up on the walls in an attempt to make the space feel vintage? Buca Di Beppo throws junk, and knick knacks and statues and anything else 'italian' they could find in the chinese warehouse where they loaded up these goods. It's a terrible horrible mess and you end up sitting in a yardsale of italian paraphenalia while eating your very bland pasta.It's embarassing how truly flavorless the food is here. Thin, flavorless alfredo sauce. Thick slabs of lasagna with less taste than what I can get out of the frozen section at Publix. I went with a large group and across the table, bland food.When they seat your party, they guide you through the kitchen area where the cooks play along and say a welcoming hello. Deep down you know they hate this. Why are we in the kitchen? Sure it's nice, but I'd rather have them concentrating on making the food, and making it good. Of course, the food at Buca Di Beppo seems to be far beyond any point of return to tasting good. It's just dead. Dead food. No life, no flavor, not emotion. I get more flavor from the $.99 Michelina's frozen lunch package.Far from claiming anything authentic Italian, Buca Di Beppo even pumps out bread with no taste. Eating at Buca is like eating food from an assisted living facility. No salt, no sugar, no butter, no fat, it's all gone along with anything resembling taste. Sure, Buca has huge portions, and the setup is nice for large parties and families - but they might as well just buy the family-size pasta packs from the frozen section and bake it at home, even that would be better, and they wouldn't have to the mandatory gratuity. Say what you will about other italian chains like Macaroni Grill, or Olive Garden - at least their food taste like something.~~#~1
Just did take out.  Great experience.  Easy to place my order over the phone, friendly service.  Nice that they have special pick up parking spots and entrance.  Made it an in and out operation.  Ordered the gluten free pizza with pepperoni and sausage.  My husband and son loved it and have already been asking to get it again.  I had the spaghetti calzone and was in HEAVEN.  I highly recommend it.~~#~1
As a previous reviewer stated:  "This restaurant is like no other".  We had a birthday celebration and we couldn't have chosen a better place to eat.  First of all, the service is second to none.  Every staff member that we encountered was very professional and happy to explain the food and answer any questions we had.  They obviously like working there because they were all so upbeat and smiley.  You feel welcome as soon as you step in the door.Now for the food - fantastic!  I ordered the four course tasting menu and everything was superb.  My husband ordered the ribeye steak and enjoyed every mouthful, although the portion was a bit on the small side.  But, in between each course came a little treat of creativity from the chef so that's something we've never encountered before.  For example, we each had an espresso sized cup of a creamy soup that was so delicate and delicious that we were wishing for more.  They also served us a little savory doughnut, about the size of a dollar coin, that was oh-so-good as well as little cranberry "shooters" that had little teenie squares of jello (not really jello, of course, but a fruit gel of some sort).  Somewhere in between everything else we were also served a prosciutto mousse that was smooth and delicate.  As the meal drew to an end, they again brought out a little taster and this time it was piping hot mini cinnamon souffles with a creme anglaise on top.  For dessert, I ordered the goat's milk panna cotta that had a marmalade bottom and alongside were orange, grapefruit and strawberry segments and to top that off the server drizzled honey over all.  Fantastic!We didn't consume any alcohol but we did have a nice bottle of water and purchased two coasters ($10/each) that flash colored lights when a glass is placed on them.  The total was $169, including the coasters but not including the tip so it wasn't an inexpensive night but it was well worth it.  I can't wait until the next birthday celebration!~~#~1
I want to like this place as it is in the neighborhood and there aren't many other options around here, but this is probably the worst restaurant/bar I've ever had the misfortune of going to. My last trip I sat down to order a beer at the bar.  The bartender takes about five minutes to get me a beer, despite the bar being nearly empty, as he was too busy for me with his time and focus instead spent flirting with one of the servers.  I drink my beer and want another.  The glass sits empty for about five minutes while he paces around the bar.  I try on three occasions to get his attention and ask for another.  The dude is just ignoring me at this point.  I guess they don't want my business and I just leave.  He can have the 8 cents he owes me in change for a tip... I just want out of here.  I feel bad when I leave that he even got the 8 cents from me.  I hope he spends it well.On other trips here my wife and I have had the food.  It's not any better than the service sadly.  I have an English Bulldog at home with a poop eating problem and I'm not sure he would even find this food acceptable.  Overall just the worst restaurant around and it's no surprise why the place always looks so dead out front.  Nobody's there because it's simply horrible.  Avoid at all cost.  I wouldn't eat here again, but would give the bar another shot if I heard the replaced all the help.  Whoever owns this place needs to clean house.  Looking at other reviews on here, I see I'm not alone in my feelings about the service.  Get rid of these people already... just sad!!~~#~1
The Orange is a popular, well-reputed joint in my neighborhood. The Pizzaria is connected to a small bakery and deli. IMO, it's overpriced and over-rated. The parking is usually impossible and often dangerously full of gargantuan SUVs and expensive sports cars. There is valet parking available at times that is also overpriced, pretentious, and unnecessary. The parking lot is tiny and I need a valet to park my car? What a racket. Overflow parking is available on street in the bicycle lane (thanks a lot folks!)I used to have coffee here in the mornings week-ends in the outdoor cafe', but the place has become a neighborhood nusiance. The orange caters to a clientele that largely appears to regard itself as quite UMC. Probably they should be located in Paradise Valley instead of eastern Phoenix.I give it three stars because the food is good. That can't be disputed. The facilities and the company leave much to be desired though. If your idea of an enjoyable experience includes good food surrounded by SUV-driving soccer moms with ears adhered to cell phones, this place might just be for you.~~#~0
Been here a few times and the food is always fresh and tasty.  I am Chinese from northern China.   This is authentic northern Chinese cuisine.  Food is not fancy but extremely delicious and satisfying.  Highly recommend the Zha Jiang noodles (meat sauce with hand made noodles), the chives and egg pocket, and dumplings.  Good prices and comforting home made Chinese food.  Owners are very nice.~~#~1
Much more organized than the last time I was there, and I noticed more price systems vs having to ask. The even had the new Color Club halo hues I have been hunting for!!! They had 5 of the 6 colors and they were the highest priced polished in the store at 6.50 a pop!! Still MUCH cheaper that the 11$ everywhere else. No striping tape!!! Although the owner did say he had ordered it before and it didn't sell well...... I just went down the street and got some...:)) yay candy cane nails!!!~~#~1
Stopped by here for lunch today... I saw the Burger sign outside and thought I would try it out. WOW!! This place is amazing. The owner/chef was taking the orders and was super helpful and friendly. I had a Paradise CHZ which came with 2 patties, smoked mozzarella lettuce, tomato, caramelized onion as well as cucumber. I also ordered  Sweet Potato Tater Tots I was blown away! BEST BURGERS IN PHOENIX!  Our bill came to $18 for 2 cheese burgers, 2 sides and a soda. It was so amazing I went back for dinner. I bragged to much when I got home that my boyfriend just had to try it. I had the special which was a Roasted Duck Burger (2 beef patties, topped with roasted duck, caramelized onions, bacon, fried egg over easy served with duck au jus) By far the best burger of my life. My boyfriend got the Beach House (2 beef patties. roasted green chili, smoked mozzarella, pico de gallo and jalapeno ranch) He also ordered the seasoned fries. I don't care for fires and I think I could eat 3 orders they were so good. His was so good he ordered another burger. For Desert we shared a Maple Pecan Bacon Milkshake, also to die for. I really think I need one of these every night.From the atmosphere, the music, the staff to the food every thing about PV Burgers was a hit.This is a must go!~~#~1
This is place is a weekly trip for us as my girlfriend loves the salmon and martini's they serve here. We have been frequenting this place ever since we moved to the area versus the rare trips we would take for the awesome cream cheese chocolate cake made by Caroline or the lunch Caesar chicken sandwich. Here are my ratings of each dining point I consider when going here:Service: 5/5 Fast and very helpful, Even the chef will dig up custom stuff and cares what people think of the new entrees.Ambiance: 4/5 The place used to be a home so it's a little cramped but nice nonetheless. Not as comfy as some others like Ticoz but we like it. As it is smallin seating ranges you can't get too loud so keep the rowdy folks to the Applebees locales.Drinks: Ginger ale and the kiltlifter is nice as well as the blackwidow and black / blue martinis.recommended Food:Fish 5/5: My girl's favorites are the halibut,swordfish,miso salmon with basmati rice, she also loves the spinach and asparagus.Sandwiches: 5/5 for roast chicken with green chili, side of coleslaw or balsamic salad 4/5 chicken caesar is good but sometimes is hit and missmeatloaf: 5/5 best I have ever had, it is a beauty.Tacos: 4/5 One time I had pork tacos they were the best ones I had tasted, the next time they were ok, then the last time they were great, not sure why but still recommended.Cream cheese cake: 5/5 Made from local baker who used to do deserts for Circa 1900 but now does it for them and Urban Bean to name a few.Steak,chicken, pork: 3/5 I have tried each and every one here and while you wont be disappointed there isn't a wow factor like the meatloaf. The sauces seem to not match or compliment the specific meat in my opinion. I would love a bordelaise sauce or onions and mushrooms with the filet for example.Appetizers: ?/? I am not a fan of  the bruschetta but haven't tried the rest. I have heard the crab cakes are awesome but have yet to compare them to Fez's awesome versions.Pricing is on par with Sophie's but less than Christopher's and more that Ticoz. I am fine with it as the food I order is totally worth it.~~#~1
I've actually never set foot inside this restaurant, so I can't comment on the place itself. But every now and then we've picked up orders from Old Spaghetti Factory at work, so I can comment on the food itself. The food is as basic as it gets. This is definitely "family food." Most adults won't complain about it, and kids will enjoy the simplicity. I recently had the Old Spaghetti Factory's Chicken Parm. I won't call it bland, but it's nothing that the average home chef couldn't cook up for their family. I will give the place credit for the portions. It's not expensive and you get a lot of food. While the chicken itself was not huge, it comes with Spaghetti, an entire loaf of bread and butter, and a side salad. The salad was way too plain for my taste, but at least I had a little bit of vegetables to go with my meal. It's also quick. Take out orders are almost always said to be ready within 10 to 15 minutes.~~#~0
D-scust-ing.~~#~1
I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!  I have tried several of their subs and although they are all delicious the Chipolte Cheese Steak (it's the # 43) is my favorite!  It is the MOST DELICIOUS sub I have ever had!!!  The bread is always soft and fresh, it is extremely filling because it's stuffed full of steak, peppers, and cheese!!!!  To make it absolutely the BEST sub ever have them add some of the little red chili's to it (I think they call it chili relish)....OMG!!!!!~~#~1
Walk the other way, just walk right the hell the other way...Here was how this played out.  Oktoberfest a few days ago.  Starting the night off.  I walk past this place and see a place that sells a slice of pizza for $1.99.  Good, right?  No.  me: "Hi, one slice of pizza please"guy: "you buy drink with it, 4 dollars."me: "no, just one slice of pizza"guy: "we do not sell one slice, you have to buy a drink.  4 dollars"I should have pulled a flag on this play at this point, but knowing I was going to be drinking I move forward wanting food in me. Not a wise move.me: "so, I can't buy one slice?"guy: "no, you buy a drink with slice, 4 dollars."me: "It doesn't say that anywhere on the menu or walls"guy: "No, do not sell one slice.me: "what the... O.K., give me 2 slices of pizza"guy: "you buy two slices then."me: "yes, Jesus Christ, yes"guy: "toppings?"me: "no, no toppings.  cheese."guy: "we have toppings."what is this guy, fucking deaf? me: "no thanks"I give him the money.guy: "it take 10 minutes, you wait."I don't think they run the air conditioner in this place, so I wait outside.Pizza comes out.  Tastes like absolute crap.  I eat it outside because in September in Chandler Arizona it is cooler outside then inside this place.  I think they had the thermostat set to "HELL" Guy working or running the place comes outside and stares me down as I am eating.  I'm sure if you want to eat here you can check the dumpster for plenty of slices to try beforehand to avoid having to pay for one.  Excuse me, avoid having to pay for two.  However after what I had served to me I'm pretty sure they will beat you to the garbage cans and sell it back to some other unsuspecting soul.  I was the only one dumb enough to finish all the food.  Wouldn't eat here if there was a natural disaster and this place was the last to be ransacked for provisions.  I'd keep walking.FAIL.~~#~1
The main reason to miss a star is that the one that we ordered (the mint-lamb) was a bit dry to my taste and no mint to taste at all. For desert we had the apple one and that was much better. I'd like to try a different one some other time and compare :).Good environment, and for groups, friendly staff who would explain you what they are cooking!!~~#~0
I love how all other Yelpers reviewing this company have discovered the same issues that would never permit me to use their services again. Company is a disaster and should be reported to the BBB.~~#~1
if you like terrible service and overpriced food you've come to the right place.  If I knew before I went in there I would be paying $16.00 for macaroni and cheese, and had the pleasure of waiting around for an hour to get it, while my glass remained empty, I would've stayed away (which is what you should do).  Food wasn't awful, although 2 members of the party did cut up their mouths eating the hard as a "Rock" bread on their sandwiches. The mac n' cheese was nothing special.  The service was beyond poor.  First and last time I will eat at Hard Rock Cafe.~~#~1
Great food. Great ambiance. Great for a night date on the patio. I can't wait to go again.~~#~1
You know that scene in Fast Times at Ridgemont High where Jeff Spicoli takes one of his Vans off and hits himself on his head? Well that's what I did when I went to this place for the first time.   Why haven't I been coming here for the last 10 years, this place is great!!!  I would say this is the best non-Pizzeria Bianco/Cibo pizza in the valley.  The crust is awesome, sauce and cheese just perfect!The really impressive part is is how picture perfect the pizzas are made.The lobster ravioli were huge, easily enough for two.  Baked Ravioli's were better that average but needed more basil or something.You really can't dine here, so it's take out or delivery.  They have one table and a few other seats inside if you had to eat here I guess you could.~~#~1
Jeremiah is great! He is very friendly, patient, and knows what he's doing! We started off with the Drunken Cheesy Bread, it's ok. Not something I would want again. Nothing wrong with it, just not my taste. For lunch, I had the Chicken Parmesan sandwich, along with a house salad. The sandwich is great. Loved it. The house salad... I mean, I could not stop eating it. I have no idea which kind of dressing was on it, but it was AMAZING. I am craving it just thinking about it. The interior is very clean, roomy, very casual. I heard they have great happy hour, so I will be back again.~~#~1
Mediocre, bland, low quality food topped off with painfully slow service.  I worked in the neighborhood and continued to return occasionally "just in case it's gotten better", for reasons I could never fathom once the plate of abysmal food was placed on the table.  The salsa and rice are usually good, but that's the most I have to offer.~~#~1
I give this place 3 stars because of how friendly the lady that worked there was and how amazing their prices were. It was pretty unorganized though and I am sure that it is due to people moving books to where they shouldn't be and there just being too many books to keep organized. It is not a bad book store at all, just be prepared to have to dig and dig for what you are looking for. Worth it though for the prices :)~~#~0
I tried Rare Earth for the first time as a solo diner.  Often a good way to get the take on a new restaurant.  I sat at the bar which has surprisingly uncomfortable seating.  Really hard seats that cut me in the back of the knees.  The wine selection is nice.  Not big but two or three choices of each variety.I ordered a glass of wine,  a small House salad and a pizza.  The server behing the bar was "professionally friendly"  Then the wait began.  Fifteen minutes passed and I still had no salad.  I was able to get the servers attention and asked about my salad. She didn't check on the status of the salad but gave the excuse that several people had come in around the same time that I did.Just about 3 minutes later both my salad and my pizza came out at the same time.  Very disappointing.  I wanted to eat my salad but I didn't want my pizza to go cold.  Note: This is extremely thin pizza...like a cracker crust...so it goes cold very quickly.The server offered to send the pizza back to keep it hot but since it had fresh tomato on it, I didn't want the pizza to be ruined.The house salad was fresh, good mushrooms and shaved pecorino cheese.  There were lots of red onions and the dressing, a house vinaigrette was very strong "and vinegary". For me the onion and vinegar were just overwhelming and I would not order that particular salad again.The pizza had a good amount of toppings and held together pretty well, even considering how thin the crust is. I would like to try this restaurant again because there were several things on the menu that sounded really good.4 stars for the pizza, 2 stars for the salad that I ordered and 3 stars for the service.~~#~0
I was in Bomberos for breakfast this morning, and I was told they now carry Coca Lite!  So much better than Diet Coke - I had no idea I could find it anywhere in the US!  How great is that?Also, Bomberos is now using MJ Breads and Tammie Co pastries... not too shabby, huh?~~#~1
Food wise, this is my favorite Lenny's location. They make the perfect jalapeno cheese burger. The fries are really good too.The location kind of sucks. Its  surrounded by a greyhound station, a liquor store and some kind of AA hall. Need I say more?~~#~0
I recently saw a Coyotes game here and I was seriously impressed. This arena is super nice, almost mall-like and clean on the inside. What also impressed me was how much stuff there is around the arena. Where I'm from, you'd have to drive somewhere else if you want to go to dinner before or hang out after the game. Here you can just stay in your cozy little free parking spot and hang around. Probably my only gripe is that the screens on the inside could be a little bigger, but other than that. this arena is right up there.~~#~1
What a place for brunch. $4 drinks are fantastic. Their tenderloin egg Benedict and sea food sandwich is heavenly. Wish we had such a place in Los Angeles.~~#~1
I've heard about this place being "the best" burger joint so i had to check it our for myself. My boyfriend and i went on a saturday afternoon and to my surprise most of the seats were taken, people were coming and going so my first thought was they must be good since they were so busy. Severs were really nice and prompt.we both ordered their 1/3 lb arizona smashburger which has: habanero cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, onion, chipolte mayo and fresh jalapenos on a chipotle bun, we also had an order of their smash fries.first thought, the presentation of the burgers and fries looked great, after putting mustard and ketchup on it and TRIED to pick up the burger everything almost feel out. It was messy and greasy totally ruined the experience of enjoying the burger. It tasted like any other burger, nothing really special about it. Their fries however were amazing. on a scale of 1-10 i would give this place a 6 just for the food presentation. my boyfriend said he wouldn't go back but i'll give it another try one day.~~#~0
Fast service. Great burgers and fries. So far the Arizona burger coupled with sweet potato fries is my favorite.~~#~1
Island Terrayki is a great place to eat at.  The owners are nice the prices are right you can't go wrong with that.  My coworkers and I have been going there for a few years now and we all love it.  Highly suggest eating here if you are in the northwest valley and want some good quality food.~~#~1
Whitney walked into Renegade Canteen and never had a chance. Nor did any of her previous favorite Scottsdale spots. The green chile pork stew is enough to make a good date great or a bad date totally tolerable. Tender, juicy, sent from above...having this dish once is not enough. You won't have the heart to inform your mother that after tasting McGrath's bowl of deliciousness, any pork dish she's ever prepared seems dry and flavorless. We can only hope that the clouds in heaven are made of the mashed potatoes. I get them every time. The filet was the best steak I've ever had (I've thought about it, trust me) and the Dr. Pepper braised short rib will give you something else to think about the next time the Kiss "Dr. Love" commercial comes on. yummmmmmers.~~#~1
This is a Mom & Pop Mexican restaurant on Tempe's east end, the food is awesomeand of the good "Homemade" quality. Known the family for almost 30 yrs now.~~#~1
ABSOLUTELY ADORE THIS RESTAURANT!!!! Amazing location and such a great food !!! Been going there for a long, long time! I have yet be even slightly annoyed. BLISS! They wait on you hand and foot, food presentation and TASTE is Fantastic...Always make you feel very special.. the hostesses are not rude nor snooty and are always smiling- GREAT Managers! LOVE them all around! ( and I AM SUPER PICKY ( and Proud of it!) DO IT!!! GO THERE!!!!! #1 rest. per me in AZ for beautiful location and food!~~#~1
Had a family style meal and everything was delicious.  Rigatoni in a cream sauce with chicken was outstanding, as was the pound cake dessert.  Appetizer stuffed mushrooms were also really good.On the pricey side, but nice for a special occasion.~~#~1
yet another phoenix joint w/ hip decor and a solid menu.  nice gold on brown color scheme, soaring ceilings.   cute marker board to write all over at whim. the food? some of the best glorified bar food in town, albiet pricey. sampled several top notch martinis, the smoked salmon app, good chicken burger and sweet potato fries.  place also has bocce ball which makes for a fun diversion. my biggest complaint is the terrible acoustics.  It was so loud my ears hurt and I felt that a hundred people were simulaneously shouting into a steel drum.  Can we put some softies on the wall or something? But then, again, it's a bar.~~#~0
I went out here tonight with a couple of clients.  I had heard some good things about it, and they were from back East, so I thought to myself, "why not?"  I must admit I was not that impressed with it all.We came here for dinner.  Started out with some apps, and ordered the Monster Platter.  Complete with "sliders" on it that rivaled a Jumbo Jack for shear size, this could easily feed a family of four for a week.  Thank God there were 10 of us.  Most everyone ordered steak for dinner, and most were impressed.  I, on the other hand, was not that impressed.  All I could taste on my steak was butter, not meat.  I almost had to reach for the A1 Sauce, a cardinal sin in my mind with steak, just to make it edible.Since we all had a round of golf in the morning, none of us opted for the giant 3-liter beer option they had.  But the booze selection, including wine, was quite impressive.  Service all around was very attentive.  And for those of you that love your barely-18 and barely-100lbs servers that Scottsdale is serving up on a daily basis, this is a great place for you.There were a few people in our group that opted for the bull ride, a nice little touch that gave this place that little something extra to set it apart from the other Old Town places.  All things considered, I don't think I'd head back here.  I can get a better steak at a Chili's-type place, and the atmosphere (comprised mainly of your younger Scottsdale-types) didn't really do all that much for me.A couple other things of note:  their happy hour only goes until 6:30 (boo!!) but they do have a daily brunch that, strictly reading off the menu, did not look half bad.  I may have to check that out some day.~~#~0
The staff is friendly and will give you a smile.  The store is clean.   The plaza is very nice and a good place to shop for all kinds of things.  That said, the food is typical of a chain style and reflects my 3 rating.   I'm sure many people will enjoy the food.  I just prefer a Pollo Asado Burrito from one of the local "mom & pop" shops.   Overall, it's OK.~~#~0
Let's start with an SAT-type question:Scottsdale Stadium :: AT&T Park is like _______ :: Oakland Coliseum.a) Oakland A'sb) Rickey Hendersonc) Phoenix Municipal Stadiumd) Yankee StadiumIf you answered C, you, my friend are correct.  And you're pretty smart, too.  Give yourself a pat on the back.Much like Oakland Coliseum, Phoenix Muni won't amaze you with state-of-the-art facilities, breathtaking views or spectacular nightlife nearby.  What you get here is a functional, simple, 40-year-old ballpark that serves its purpose.  The crowds here are much smaller than you would encounter at other parks, but it fits 6000-7000 people comfortably.  Unless you are in the premium infield seats, you will be sitting on the aluminum benches or on the grassy knoll.  Pick your poison, so to speak.We always get the infield seats, because you can sit 12 rows behind home plate for under $20.  I don't care how bad the economy is, it's a steal!  Even if you sit directly behind home plate, you will most likely struggle to see the tiny outdated scoreboard screen in the centerfield.  There are no fancy food choices at Phoenix Muni.  If you're not intimidated by enormous wieners, a footlong hot dog might be for you.  Believe me when I say, you will not be able to eat more than two, no matter how much you love hot dogs.  I am also a fan of the little dining area by the left field foul pole.  You can sit there at a table with a giant umbrella, hide from the sun and sip your beverage of choice.  If you're lucky, you can even watch the game from some of those seats.The people who work here, from ushers to concession stand clerks, are incredibly nice.  They really do want to make sure you have a great time at the game, and it shows.Parking here is very easy.  For $5, you can park in the lot right across the street.  The lot rarely gets full, and you can always almost find a spot.  I hear there are ways to find free parking if you are willing to walk a little more, but at $5, why would you?  It's important to know, though, that the walk from the lot "across the street" from the ballpark will take you about 7 minutes.  There is no crosswalk on the street, and you have to use that ridiculous pedestrian bridge they erected with the sole purpose of annoying most baseball fans.So, +1 star for great seats, +1 star for cheap parking, -1 star for horrible scoreboard, -1 star for the pedestrian bridge.  A-OK, 3 stars.~~#~0
Prices are often way too high!~~#~1
Simply an AWESOME tuna sandwich! Great service, and the atmosphere was really cool. Just wondering what the difference is between pickles and cucumbers in brine. (50 cents, apparently)~~#~1
I brought my sweet sister in law shopping at this Forever 21 location.  She had a bag full of goodies (several hundreds of dollars worth) from H&M.  She stopped at Forever 21 and  sat her bag on the ground right beside her while she tried on a pair of shoes.  Her H&M bag was stolen during that brief moment that the bag was not in her arms.....and while this certainly was not the responsibility of Forever 21....we were so disappointed in the way the Forever 21 staff reacted. They did not call security, or the police, or even offer any condolences.  They just shrugged their shoulders.  My sister in law did love some of the fashions at Forever 21....but the store was such a mess.  There were clothes all over the floor under each and every rack.  There were way too few staff members working, and many who were working were "socializing" with one another instead of helping customers or maintaining the store inventory in a decent fashion. The only employees that were on task were:  1 at the checkout, and 1 at the fitting rooms - there was a band of 5 girls dressing one mannequin while the store was amidst in chaos (including someone stealing bags from other customers)..... So - if you choose to shop at this store - hold on to your bags :)~~#~1
I went to Five Guys for the first time (North Scottsdale) to see what all the hubbub was and why everyone was comparing it to In 'N Out burger - a place I love and have been eating at for over 25 years (CA and AZ).  Pros: wider assortment of toppings and menu items, including the veggie sandwich (not a soy pattie - just veggies and cheese, if you want; extra menu items like jalapeños and hot sauce, grilled mushrooms, etc.; Cajun styled french fries (their small size is enormous).Cons:  more expensive than In 'N Out. Neutral: Thick burgers are more like your home grilled burgers, all well done and crispy on the edges - not like In "N Out's thinner patties.I don't know why people compare the two places since the prices are not similar.  Five Guys is good, but should be compared more to places like Fat Burger, regarding size and price of burger.I still prefer In "N Out for taste and value.~~#~0
Recently was invited to this restaurant & found out that they have children's plates for adults or any age.It was SUPER CHEAP & it included a drink with refills like tea or soda etc.What a deal!Under 5. bucks including the drink.I will definitely  be going back  to any Cracker Barrel who has this deal because it is cheaper than fast food etc. or just about anywhere.~~#~1
Oregano's is my FAVORITE restaurant in all of Tempe! The food is delicious - I've never been disappointed by a single appetizer, entrée or desert! And since they've recently add Blue Moon beer on draft I could stay here on the patio all day. Bonus: The wait staff is incredibly fun and friendly. Just a really great place to dine!~~#~1
I love this place. Every time I visit I come here. I did miss out of Bucket of Crab night :(~~#~1
Talk about one of the best burgers in town...in fact i think houstons and this place have the best burgers in phoenix!!!! I took one bite and i was in heaven...it was a whole new take on a burger but not too crazy!! I love the fries especially when you mix the sweet potato fries with the regular ones OMG!!!  I like to dip them in ranch but you can select what you want to.dip them in...i have to thank.my sister for this place she introduced me!!! Its a great place to.go for lunch and dinner but it.is not very big so you may have to wait but its worth it!!! Its a fun place do not miss it...~~#~1
We finally visited the new restaurant 3 1/2 years after the Richardson's fire. It is quite amazing how similar the new Richardson's looks and feels like the former landmark restaurant. Their service is great. We ordered a pizza and salad. I should have known better to order a pizza from a New Mexico style restaurant... roasted tomato sauce with New Mexico sausage and mozzarella. It brought back memories of conversations with my Papa debating whether Prego or Ragu was the better canned tomato sauce.~~#~0
Dr Brodkin is one of the greatest doctor out there.  She was voted two years in a row for arizona foothill top doctor and it shows!!!  She is caring, and overall great doctor.  She moved her office last year and wow did she change for the best.  The staff is great her new nurses i love love love....i recommend Dr Brodkin to anyone who need  a GYN....~~#~1
After shopping all over town and visiting every single shop in the phx area I stumbled into this little gem.   Store was clean and only stocked with desirable items and lacked the items that just arent used by the majority, but I am sure could be ordered if needed.    This planning I found easy to make my purchases in a quicker manner since I dont always have the time to sort through typical store junk, there just isnt any here! Only quality sought after items.  Management is second to none and the business is family owned and operated.   When you walk in your greeted and after a few visits by name even.  This is a huge plus and isnt found anywhere else in town that I have seen.   There is a prefered customer program and most livestock is local grown and special items are taken in a wish list and you can get called once available.    After my month long search for the perfect store to set up my custom order that could also fulfill my stocking needs I couldnt get my order in fast enough for a complete custom setup installed and delivered.   Pricing was fantastic and cheaper than anywhere in town and the ability to come in anytime and get advice no matter what the need is makes this shop feel like home when you walk in.   If your looking for a one stop shop that is friendly, knowledgeable, and isnt out to empty your wallet in a bad way this is your place.   Thanks again Reef Monsters for the help in sorting out what was an overwhelming amount of information into a custom tailoring to what I could handle and needed to continue in this hobby.~~#~1
I absolutely love Chompies! It's the closest thing to a New York style deli that I have found in Phoenix. They have a very large and extensive menu and everything I've ordered has been really good.They also have an amazing bakery that offers a very large assortment of tasty treats such as black and white cookies, red velvet cake, enormous éclairs, napoleons, and New York style cheese cake.I'd say that my favorite thing on the menu is the pastrami sandwich, although I recently tried the Jewish Sliders after seeing them on Man vs. Food. The sliders were really good, unlike any slider I have ever had. The challah bread and potato pancake gave these sliders a very unique flavor, very tasty. I also tried the Western Sliders and those are good as well. Although I live closer to their new location in Chandler, I still go to the Tempe location because of the hot ASU waitresses.Chompies is the best!~~#~1
This is  the best Asian restaurant in town! Previously Shanghai Palace, this out of the way restaurant serves up some of the best curry and pad Thai, that I have ever tasted in my life! The Panang Curry is so savory and aromatic, literally one of the best things I have ever had. I honestly crave this dish about twice a week.Also any thing on the menu can be made vegetarian this is a huge bonus for all veggie's around town! The Chef-owner Tottie Kaya, is always very hospitable. She walks around to each table making sure everything is up to standard. I have never once had a bad experience at this delicious eatery. So if you love Asian cuisine, you must dine at Tottie's!~~#~1
Mulligan's is that place in Scottsdale you don't think of going to when you're in the mood for dancing, which is mostly why I go out in Scottsdale at night. But I always find myself there either before or after my dance trips. I totally dig the atmosphere at Mulligan's - it's chill, unpretentious, and never obnoxiously crowded. The prices are decent and the location is pretty centralized.  The DJ isn't always the best, but when you're with good friends and good drinks, Mulligan's makes you feel at home. Mulligan's kind of has that dive bar feel but doesn't make you feel like you might get mugged and stabbed in the eye.~~#~0
Best pizza I've had anywhere.  Perfect, perfect and I mean perfect crust.  Thin, chewy, smoky and sweet.  Lots of interesting toppings that center around fresh, local produce.  I deeply envy the regulars here.~~#~1
I have been going to the Matador since I was little when it was a little hole in the wall on 2nd Street.  They have always had great Sonoran style Mexican food!  It's always our go to place when we attend events downtown or have business to attend to. They also have the best hot sauce in town!  As far as the service,  the food comes out quickly and we never really have to wait long.  If you're downtown and looking for great food I would highly recommend this place.~~#~1
What an awesome neighborhood bar. I brought my little brother here when he was in town and the service was spectacular. For entertainment they have pool, darts, games and music. Our waitress Chris was more than attentive. I will defiantly be coming back!~~#~1
This used to be my favorite fro-yo place.  A couple of years ago, I would have given them a 4, but lately I am noticing there is no real rotation on the flavors. Always the typical cookie monster, chocolate and vanilla.  My favorite is Pistachio, I haven't seen it here.  I am addicted to fro-yo, but if I am going to indulge, it better be special.  The location is nice, and I know I will be back if I am in the area and one of the cravings hits.~~#~0
After hitting up the bank to sign some paper work, I wanted to stop by the Biltmore for a quick lunch and had Paradise Bakery in mind.  As I was making my way through, I encountered a new facade with Southwestern designs that I have never seen before.  "Cool!" as I exclaimed to myself. It looked intriguing enough that I went in to ask the hostess for a menu.  After gazing around for a few minutes, the Chimichanga Entrée caught my attention! Content I was! j'adore Chimis!After being seated in the, rather blandish, outdoor patio area with mistifiers cooling away, I put in my order: a Chimi and an Arnold Palmer.Not too long, my waitress brought out some cool, fresh salsa and chips.  Nothing too dazzling, quite ordinary.  Chips were crispy, oily, and a tad salty.  Arnold palmer seemed to lack both the sweetness and citrus.Now come the Chimi with a side of rice and beans.  Typical Mexican, you would think right? Well, up until I took my first bite into the rice! Puzzled face I was--like an Anime character.  I steadily kept taking small bites after small bites, analyzing what in the heck I was eating.  Generally, it was just sweet and overpowering what I would think a Mexican rice should be.  The corn bits probably only enhanced the sweetness further! The waitress confirmed honey was used but I initially guessed coconut!The beans with pieces of bacon was just simple and watery.  At first, it seemed to have that smoky, cowboy-ish hint to it, but fell short of a decent side.The Chimi was quite underwhelming in its overall taste.  What blanketed this deep-fried burrito were green chili (tasteless for the most part), drizzle of this sweet white cream (unsure of what), and some white cheese (unsure).  The tortilla shell was crisped enough and the chicken shred lacked the savoriness that I would have expected from a true Mexican joint.Nothing made sense to me! Where was the Mexican? I tried very hard to find the positive in my meal.  I quit half way to be honest.  I hate to mention this, but I did garbled some of what I chewed back out to my plate.  Overall, it missed the savoriness that would have saved the meal.  I desperately wanted Tabasco sauce like it was the end of the world, but unfortunately it was too late.I explained my calm, analytical dining experience to my waitress and she was very understanding and was fine with removing the item from the bill.  5-stars for that.I really am unsure of returning as first impression is a pretty big deal to me.  The happy hour menu did not look that appealing either.I guess the question is, how much can you expect out of Mexican-esque establishment that sits on a Fashion Park?  Heed, heed, heed this review.~~#~0
unless you hate ice cream and friendly people you will love Papa Ed's! It's tucked away in Caitlin Court in downtown Glendale.  Walking towards the front you can't help but notice all the love and care that went into the garden and flowers - the flower bed still makes me smile!  Walking through the front door it's easy to forget where and when you are - the wood floors, Vintage coke machine and friendly staff all most made me forget why I was there... ICE CREAM. good selection and great ice cream.. Now let's talk about ice cream pie... Papa Ed's makes to order (with advance notice) ice cream pies. I love the Peanut butter cup with Oreo cookie crust. The lemon and Raspberry sorbet swirl in a  graham cracker crust and my Holiday Favorite - Pumpkin Pie Ice Cream in a graham cracker crust!~~#~1
I have been shopping at Lee Lee's for over ten years.  The store stocks Chinese, Malaysian, Korean, Japanese, West Indian and other foods.  You can usually find what you are looking for here.  The fish selection is vast, fresh and reasonably priced.  They have the finest selection of noodles and yerba mate tea!!!Enjoy~~#~1
Y'know, rarely do I buy the "extended warranty" that most places try to peddle on you nowadays. If you buy the item from a reputable manufacturer, it should be unnecessary. In the case of tires, I have to make an exception. You can control the quality of tires you buy and put on your car, but not the quality of construction workers who don't know how to secure their nails, screws and bolts for travel on highways, streets and other local thoroughfares. They're a nefarious bunch for the most part. I'm not for extra taxes, but I'm contacting my local elected officials to institute a tax on all businesses who transport these little metal devils on the streets we drive...and stiff penalties/massive fines if they get caught dropping a load of these on the highway. For the second time in a year, one of my tires caught one of the little buggers -- this last one was not a nail or screw, mind you, but a BOLT.  I pulled my receipts from the glove compartment, used Yelp to find the nearest Discount Tire, and called for a tow. The replacement certificates I got were $16 per tire (back in NC, but they're good here too), and worth every penny. The folks at this Discount Tire location were extremely nice, and had me in and out of there in about 30 minutes (with no appointment). There is even free water for customers. They were able to fix the tire instead of replacing it, which is fine (as long as it holds). Every Discount Tire location I've visited has been great as far as the transparency of what you're getting, the quality of customer service, and the wait. In a town of 4.3 million people and never-ending road construction, I have to recommend the free replacement warranty on your tires, no matter where you buy them. I prefer getting mine from DT.~~#~1
Came in with high expectations.Wonderful surroundings, I love the New York concept here. And the area attracts a higher quality of person, which appeals to me.Place was packed on a Friday night of course , drinks were good, lots of attractive people, and a FABULOUS band playing.However, the energy/vibe in the room didn't match the band's energy. There were many 40+ something men going after early to mid 20s girls/women. That resonated throughout the place. I actually walked around the entire venue to see if I "felt" differently, but nope it was all over. Not only that but people were indifferent about dancing in groups with strangers. I was there with my wife and she doesn't really dance so I tried to casually get into a group of 3 or 4 and there was no welcoming. I was disappointed.So we left after maybe 30-45 minutes, probably never to return, unless people start raving about the venue, which will mean either the people changed or new people have discovered it.~~#~0
So, my eye has been bothering me for months now and i decided to go there to have it checked out again. Yes - Again! I went there when it started first and had it looked at - "Nothing wrong, here are some artificial tear drops." Humm ok. Months later i am still in pain. So, i call and ask for appointment with another Doc. I show up there fashionably 10 min early, check in, put my ass in the chair and wait. And wait. And wait some more, for the total of 40+ min. Aaaaaalright, i had worse waits before. So i go in and some super unpleasant lady asks me some questions and leaves. Then Doc comes in and does whatever they do there. Sure enough there is some other elderly chick there in tow for some reason. Just standing there glaring. Geesh What is up with that?So, anyhow - 3 stars! For the long wait and super unpleasant stuff. Where they found those witches anyhow? "Its alright"~~#~0
I had lunch at Villalpando's with a group of co-workers and this place is A-OK. The food wasn't spectacular, but everyone was satisfied with it and the prices are reasonable. The restaraunt was not very busy which makes it an easy place to go to with a large group. The service was friendly and had no problem with making substitutions to the menu items. I do like that they offer chile relleno that's not breaded and fried!~~#~0
Best whole in the wall Chinese food in the west valley! I have been going here as a kid and I would go there again and again. Take out is great and I would recommend getting take out there. Now, eating there I might not suggest, taking the food home is awesome!~~#~1
Beautiful hotel, great rooms, best views out of the resorts in the immediate area.  Service is comparable to a Ritz Carlton.  Very understated and clean feeling, yet still over the top luxurious.~~#~1
I went here due to a Restaurant.com coupon. The menu was expensive, which made me think that it was a fancy place, but it turns out that the food was expensive because it was a restaurant inside a hotel! It was inside the Sheraton and I didn't see any signs outside indicating it was there. We'd made reservations since it was a Friday night, but they really weren't necessary, as there were only two other families in the restaurant. We'd dressed up. We were the only ones.The restaurant area was really very modern beautiful. They'd made good use of lighting effects and there was a large, full bar wrapped along the back portion.We ordered the Pan-Seared Cheese (which were basically fried cheese poppers - delicious, but definitely overpriced considering only 4 of them came on a plate) as an appetizer. My date ordered the Baron's Burger (your basic burger), and I ordered the Valley of the Sun Ribs. The ribs were a little dry, but I really loved the "Arizona croquette" that came with them. It was fried crispy on the outside with creamy mashed potatoes on the inside.With the restaurant.com coupon, the meal was reasonably priced, but without it, I would have felt a little ripped off.~~#~0
I'm in (puppy) love with the new Wag N'Wash in Scottsdale...I'd been to the Phoenix location years ago and remember wishing they were closer to my home, and my wish was granted... this new location is less than a mile from where I live!Minnie and I popped in a few weeks back for a self-serve bath.  I initially called to see if a groomer was in, but they were booked out for weeks.  Doing it myself was actually not only cheaper, but it was fun... and a good bonding experience for me and Min as well.  Sara helped us out and explained our options.  We decided on the ultimate wash which included an extremely efficient shampoo and conditioner, brushes, towels, cologne, etc... It was easy and quick - bonus! Minnie was clean and fresh within 20 minutes or so!Of course we spent a tad bit more time at the store doing some shopping and I was impressed with the dog food selection, homemade treats, eco-friendly collars and leashes, etc...I'll definitely head back to Wag N' Wash again really soon... so psyched that they moved to my 'hood!~~#~1
Great food, great Sangria, great live music, great vibe, great service EXCLAMATION MARK. Overall it was a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon.~~#~1
Amazing. Romantic!~~#~1
Absolute greatness!!!Service: friendlyFood: TRY the faux chicken wings (I crave this)Kung pao noodlesVegan chilli friesAmbiance - A+Tip: don't order the faux chicken wings Togo. Soggy experience plus they add the carrots, cucumber, celery in the box and close it. Equals the case of raw cooked veggies. Go next door to nami for dessert!!~~#~1
Tried the Restaurant Week special, and chose the Stetson chopped salad, mixed mushrooms with polenta, and bread pudding.  The Stetson chopped was amazing.  The preparation is beautiful when they bring it out, and then the taste is the perfect mix of sweet, savory, crunchy, soft once the salad is mixed up.  I tried some of the testosterone salad, which was decent, and filled with a lot of well prepared beef, but it didn't quite compare to the chopped salad.  Just as a general side note, if you choose the restaurant week menu and have the chopped salad and then the mushrooms, I think the flavor of the chopped salad is more bold than the mushrooms, so the mushrooms will taste bland to you.  This happened to me as I transitioned from the salad to main dish, but when I took the mushrooms home in a to go box and ate them later, the more delicate flavor showed through and I appreciated it a lot more.  The bread pudding was amazing.  Perfectly moist, with lots of flavor, and not too sweet.  Service was excellent (Thanks Owen!), and along with the extensive selection of wines, they also have some more unique beers such as lambic, as well as a nice selection of non alcoholic sodas (The cream soda is locally made and very tasty!)~~#~1
I see one word come up again and again in the reviews for this place: "Cute".Well, it is cute. The lighting and furniture and concept are happy, kind and appealing in an innocent way. The patio is cute, too.And it's not Applebee's. Oftentimes I'll be with a group of people trying to decide where to eat and drink. Someone will say "Applebee's at Central and Camelback". There will be groans. Then someone will think of Maizie's across the street and the response is "well, it's not Applebee's". Then we go there.Aside from that, ummm . . . well . . . . .~~#~0
Side Door, West on Hayde, a small location that does it right.  If you respect the Chicago area you will recognize Vienna beef right away.  I really enjoy the italian beef at this location, its hard to find a place that serves Italian Beef (see Defalcos Scottsdale Rd).  Bianca was our server and was very helpful for my first time, at the restaurant. If you live in the area check this place out for a quick bite to eat.  Where are all the other reviews?~~#~0
I came here with a friend for a Groupon dinner.  We got an appetizer assortment , an entree each, and a house margarita.  The app plate came with mini chimichangs (yay), chicken taquitos (yay), cheese quesadilla (nay), and wings (ok).  I had a decent chicken fajita, and my friend loved her steak fajitas.  The drinks were a little too strong in my opinion.  Overall, I would need another try at this place without the Groupon deal, and see if they can execute more flavorful food.~~#~0
Being English and missing a lot of the things we can't get over here we were delighted to have found this place.  I have not tried all of the pasties and have stuck to the traditional ones that we get at home, i.e, cheese and onion and cornish and they are very good!!  I sent my husband there to buy their half baked ones so we could freeze them and have whenever we get the craving and I ended up ordering $80 worth without any regrets.  Needless to say my freezer is full of pasties and I even have a couple of ones I have not tasted before, so looking forward to trying those.  Have not eaten in the place either but quite frankly the food is that good I don't it would matter what it's like inside.  Also just noticed this is the Mesa shop we have only bought from the newly opened on in Tempe.~~#~1
Even though the new place is limited on seating the food more than makes up the difference.  I took my wife and kids for lunch.  We had some pulled pork and beef brisket sandwiches, fresh made slaw, and mac and cheese made from scratch like mom used to make.  The kids gobbled up the mac and cheese.  The meat was definately cooked with love.  Grady's makes their own signature sauce in several varieties.  They sell bottles of it as well.  I liked mixing the Hot with the Super Hot to make that pork melt that much better in my mouth.I also noticed they do catering.  I've had events catered by some other BBQ joints before, but this food is much better quality and I think I can woo the crowds with Grady's BBQ.I fully recommend stopping into my new favorite barbeque place in Arizona.Thanks for making good food Grady.  We all enjoyed it and writing this made me hungry for more.~~#~1
I love love love the chicken & hummus appetizer. Its served w/ sauteed spinach and pita. Although its an app, its large enough for a light meal. Most times, I get that w/ the beet salad and split it w/ a friend. Perfect. For those of you who avoid beets, I think you'll change your mind w/ this salad. The beets are sweet like candy.  Served w/ feta, mandarin oranges, candied pecans and a very unique pear dressing, you forget you're eating healthy. I've been trying to harvest the pear vinaigrette recipe forever!!! They won't give up the secret sauce! :( Enjoy!~~#~1
Their food isn't bad, it's pretty hard to mess up gyros, rice, salad, and fries.  When it comes to this type of food it really comes down to preference.  For me, I didn't care for this place.  I like crispy fries, their fries are soggy.  I like Beef & Lamb gyros, theirs are Beef only.  I like a mixed green salad with light onion, they serve a shredded romaine salad with heavy onion.  Their prices are fair, portions large, and service friendly, it's just not for me.  They did have a lot of sandwiches and burgers that looked good, if that's your thing.~~#~0
I have shared many an awful, hungover morning with my favorite stars from the Gay Corridor. The service can be on the scary tweaker side, but it's a good, simple breakfast that doesn't stress my dehydrated mind to find deliciousness. They've also many different healthy options, not that I've ever done more than glance at those, but it's wonderful nonetheless. It's the crown and glory of Park Central, and the only reason I still consider Park Central an actual place, as opposed to the reality of it just being a bad idea.~~#~1
The pizza here is average. It's not bad, but it's not the best pizza I've ever had, either. Was it worth $9.75 for a 12" personal pizza? No. I paid with a Fox Restaurants gift card, so I can't complain too much about a "free for me" meal. I would probably not come back again if it was on my dime. Also, my pizza was a little bit burnt on the crust. It was edible, but I was surprised that they served me slightly burnt pizza at the price of $9.75. My fiance's wasn't-- in fact, they remade his entire pizza and didn't even send it out to us because it had a hole in the crust.~~#~0
...the customer service alone gets 5 stars, but when you factor in the semi-annual sales it is more like 6.  Having been to a number of Nordstrom's in multiple cities I'd put this particular location on the same level as those in San Francisco (without the assinine traffic to contend with) and Seattle and only a notch below the best of the best in Chicago.  Living in a city with a Nordstrom and a Nordstrom Rack is going to be a daily exercise in resisting temptation.~~#~1
The absolute worse service I've encountered. My boyfriend, son and I sat at a tepan table, we were ignored for a good 15-20 minutes until my boyfriend had to ask the manager to please have someone get us something to drink. Once we had our drinks, it took another 20 minutes to order our food. By that time, another family sat at our table. My son & boyfriend ordered a meal from the tepan menu, I had sushi. Everyone on that table got their meal and I still didn't get my sushi. I asked the server to please bring it and she brought someone else's order, I had to wait another 20 minutes for my sushi. The family on our table were so upset for us as well. The food is excellent, the service is so poor I am disappointed. I advise anyone who comes here to sit at the sushi bar and deal with the Chefs, they are great. I talked to the owner and she was just as bad as the servers. I then gave it another try. I met my girlfriends there. We had dinner, spent over $200. We then moved over to the bar area and were completely forgotten about. We asked the manager/owner to please have someone come take care of us and we were told that they were concerned because we were drinking and had kids with us. One of my girlfriends had her kids but she was not drinking. I was offended that she tried to cover up the poor service with her so-called concern. Again, food is great service is lousy. I am so disappointed and will not go back. I will look elsewhere for my Caliente Rolls. I hear Blu at the Wigwam is really good and servers are hospitable.~~#~1
I am a huge fan of Saigon Nites. A friend and I regularly eat here (once weekly) and we have NEVER had a bad experience. The Steak Pho is amazing. Typically when I Have Pho I load it up with hot sauces, chili oil, etc...not at Saigon! Their Pho is ready to rock and roll the second it leaves the kitchen. Two thumbs way up!~~#~1
Food is good to the tummy. To me this is better than in and out burger. Place is spotless,  friendly service, and wide selection.~~#~1
Last night we met friends at Hillstone's and we truly enjoyed a great meal and great atmosphere.  We were met by a very friendly and helpful server who took great care of us the entire evening.  We started out with a wonderful wine recommended by our server, she let us taste 3 kinds before we chose what suited us.  We went on to enjoy the savory spinach and artichoke dip as well as fresh baked bread served with some olives and olive oil.  The caeser salad was a very large portion almost could have been my entree and the dressing was so fresh and light.  The croutons crisp and fresh baked.  We all ordered the hawaiian ribeye, OMG!! So moist and so juicy - the flavor was so fabulous and I could only eat half of it.  The loaded baked potato was also wonderful and very large.  I ended up taking half my meal home and was really happy that they let us sit quite awhile to chat with our friends after our meal was over (we were way too full for dessert however the server brought us a complimentary slice of key lime pie which my husband and friends said were fabulous I just was too full to try it) we never were rushed out and they kept refilling our drinks I can't wait to go back.  Was always a fan of Houston's in NYC and this was very much the same and enjoyed the jazzy low music in the background and the dim lighting that was warm and relaxing.~~#~1
Sadly with new owners comes changes on menu.  My fav Barbecue chicken saladno longer has a hint of the same taste. It should now be called flavor of tomato.  Also sad to find out that the most outstanding veggie sandwich now tastes like it comes from another country. Again not a single hint of similarity of same flavor. Im sure many people will love these new changes.  Yet, Im sad it's not the same. I woke up today dreaming about the old veggie sandwich! No joking!!!!!!!!!~~#~1
Tip:  If you know how to play poker...go sit at a poker table, and order the fried rice.  You get your meal for half price while playing poker.The filet mignon fried rice(ask for it rare and it will come out medium) is excellent!~~#~0
The mozzarella tomato and basil sandwich is the BEST sandwich in Phoenix, hands down. If you haven't been to Pane Bianco you are truly missing out.~~#~1
I've had this groupon for Padre's that had been burning a hole in my pocket for a long time! Finally as it neared expiration date I ventured into Phoenix to try it out. It's a cute little restaurant with a really cool red door!FYI - there's a check-in deal here! $.01 margarita! Mmhmm you saw that right! Certainly not the best I have had by any means but you can't really go wrong for that price right?After ordering our drinks we decided to splurge on an appetizer so we started out with the Queso Fundido. I was so excited about it because hey it should be all about the cheese and as a Wisconsin boy, I'm all about it! Unfortunately it was more about the spinach and not so much about the queso - it tasted really good, just missing a lot of the main ingredient in my opinion...He ordered the Mexico City Fajitas! Really well cooked chicken, with the right amount of everything! Super good! I ordered the Pollo Rellano. The chicken (as in the previous dish) was really well cooked but was lacking on the stuffed part. So it was good - just nothing wow worthy. My dish came with side of guajillo mashed potatoes - which look like a pile of mashed sweet potatoes - I personally wasn't a huge fan of the taste but as usual I'll finish my plate anyway :)The service was pretty good, it was just a very laid back environment, which I wasn't really expecting for some reason.I'm not dying to go back by any means but if someone wanted to try it out I would go again!~~#~0
This place is closed.  Good riddance.~~#~1
Was looking for something refreshing for a nightcap on a hot Scottsdale night. You will not be disappointed. The sorbet was really tasty and refreshing.~~#~1
still a big fan, wonderful pizza!!!-- Remember to join their birthday club!!!-~~#~1
The best thing was the dessert. Shrimp was alright. Nothing to write home about. Wesabi chicken was lacking.~~#~0
You like hotdogs?  Motor (thats me) says get in your Mommy's oldsmobuick and get over to TEDS!  AND you sissys that like "sonoran" style dogs talking smack about Teds, go back to Tucson and eat your fru fru pineapple topped dogs with peanut butter.   This is old style, 4th of July chargrilled hotdogs and hamburgers.  Makes my mouth water.  Ok so visualize and taste this in your mind.  First the juicy hamburgers that have the hardwood charcoal taste that makes your mouth water.  The crispy ice berg lettuce, juicy tomato and onion make this a purist burger lover's dream.  Real good home made taste.   So now act you like you always do on the 4th of July and get an all beef hotdog.  First a warning.  You will crave their hotdogs after you eat em.  The crispy plump skin that cracks in your mouth and the taste is like when you were a kid and watching the fire works on the fourth.  Add the spicy brown mustard with their ketchup "hot sauce" and buddy you got yourself dilemma.  The dilemma you ask? Is do you order one more hotdog cause they are soooo goood!  Try the Italian for a spicy dog.  Don't start with me on the fries and onion rings.  Just make sure you wear your fat pants.  Motor out and going back for another dog.~~#~1
i have 2 words for you: passive. active. dividing the dog park into sections based on tempermant isn't smart, it's f'n brilliant. 2 gates upon entrance and exit safe it up so i have no worries that my shelter dog will hit the streets again. this dog park is clean, the people are friendly and so are the dogs. finally, a place where we can all get along.~~#~1
I've ordered pizza and wings three times and the have consistently created perfection, seriously.~~#~1
I've grown to like Apple, though I've always thought their products were priced on the rich side.  When we lived in Seattle there was a Microsoft bias, but a large group of us all had Apple iPhones.  And that is a key part to the Apple story.  You buy the iPhone and then the next thing you know, you're looking at iPads.  The Genius Bar is fun and very helpful when things go wrong; like when my new phone duplicating one calendar entry 341 times.  I had to bring in my Win-Tel PC into the Genius Bar and in the end we had to delete MobileMe to fix it.   But, absolutely great, GREAT customer service!!!I love my new iPhone 4, and I've had Blackberries for 14 years!  Maybe when they add FaceTime to the iPads, I'll belly up to the Genius Bar.~~#~0
I was inspired to visit Casella's after a coworker told me about their authentically Italian goodness. As my tummy growled today, I was in the neighborhood so I knew just where to go. I walked into a simple yet clean deli. Immediately, I was welcomed by the entire staff (I believe they are all related or at least family through friendship). They asked me if it was my first time in and I said yes, so right away they started giving me a history of the shop and the tasty cuisine. Celebrating their 33rd anniversary (congrats!!), I learned that everything is homemade -- from the meatballs to the chicken salad. The owner said he goes through 40 lbs of chicken a week. He gave me a sample and the chicken was chunky and delicious. I'm not surprised he has to prepare so much chicken every week! The meatballs and freshly cut meat for Philly Cheese-steak sandwiches looked great too! The owner mentioned he is from Philly so better be ready for some authentic Philly and Italian style cookin'! While I was there, the owner was slicing some fresh provolone, so I added that to the warmed turkey sandwich I ordered. The turkey was tasty, the provolone was yummy and the sourdough roll tasted like it was fresh from the oven. It was $8 for a sandwich and soda but the sandwich was hefty enough that I saved half for later. As I walked out, everyone said goodbye to me and I felt like I was leaving a family dinner. In summary, here's what made Casella's stand out: - The very friendly staff- It's a local family-owned neighborhood deli celebrating their 33rd anniversary. Gotta support the local businesses! - Clean decor - Tasty, homemade food that's on display for visitors to see - A good family-style atmosphere that greets you the second you walk inside. I'm not sure how it's taken my so long to find this local treat, but now that I've found it, I plan on becoming a regular. Directions: Note that this is hidden in the Basha's strip mall (on the side of Granite Reef) but don't let that fool you!~~#~1
Very very good lunch spot!  Was a little disappointed when I found out they didn't have pizza on their lunch menu. But when I tasted the prosciutto "sandwich", I didn't mind anymore. It was a great meal with a relaxing & great ambiance!~~#~1
My fav Mexican place by far!  They make the most delicious chicken tortilla soup and tacos I've ever eaten. Fresh ingredients and the owners are super nice. Love this place!~~#~1
Bad shop, rude owners. Pro-tip: If you want to "enhance" the Phoenix community you could start by not playing music loudly when it's obvious that there are musicians trying to perform their sets that people paid to see at the well-respected venue next door.~~#~1
ive been here 100 times for all types of events and its a great place to eat, drink, and watch sports. I love the parmesaean garlic, teriyaki, and habenero sauces. The monthly beer specials isnt a bad deal for a tall domestic. Fries are also pretty good.~~#~0
Great food!!!  Everything on the menu is good.  The bacon guacamole burger is next to perfection.~~#~1
Pure Fitness as a whole I like. No contracts, the people going there are actually there to work out and not to be seen, (ex. LA Fitness). Plus you get complimentary training sessions. However, this location I will NEVER return to and its all because of their new GM Adam. I had a free pass and he was the one that I had been assigned to for my fitness test and 1st training session. I had already explained that I planned to join but he wouldn't stop the full court press of selling which I didnt like at all. I wanted to use my weeks free pass THEN join. He wanted me to give him money right then and there when he hadnt so much as given me a tour yet! Anyway, I told him I wanted to wait and then he starts asking when I get paid, is it a money situation, etc..if made me VERY uncomfortable. I went ahead with the training session and he knew in advance that Im not inactive but going to the gym is not something Ive done on a consistent basis in a very long time. Now I enjoyed the workout but from what others have told me..he pushed me way to hard for my first time out of the gate. My arms weren't sore, I know sore, Im okay with sore but they became weak for FIVE days, that I had trouble sleeping they had that irritable and restless feeling, and it hurt to use a freakin' date stamp at work! But the reason Im not going back..I was surfing them online and saw how easy it was to sign up online so I did. That way I wouldnt have to worry about remembering voided checks etc.  Well I called Adam to let him know and he went off on me.. just short of yelling. "Great, now I lose the commission the gym loses the points.. you can understand why Im upset right." and he went on for about 5 minutes. I was stunned at how unprofessional he was and he's the GM??? If they work on commission they should give you a heads up "hey I know its easy to sign up online but we work on commission so I would appreciate it if you went through me if and when you choose to sign up". I would have respected that. OR if when you sign up online it allows you to put in the name of the person you have been working with so it doesn't circumvent them. But I was floored and pissed that he came at me like that. Ps. Of all the Pure Fitness this one is the smallest, visually unappealing and has the worst customer service. I did sign up and I love the one I go to now...but this one I will never step foot in again~~#~1
Easily the worst "burrito" I have ever had.It amazes my that anyone would choose to eat at this chain. I bet the rations they serve from the back of UN trucks to refugees is better.~~#~1
Love all their dishes!~~#~1
To say this place is super rad would be an understatement!!  We for las noches de las luminarias.  And I wish we could've stayed longer, also seeing the gardens during the daylight is added to the 'to do' list!  Having never been there the staff was super helpful in guiding us, not to mention really friendly!  The music was entertaining and a good variety.  They also have a synthetic ice rink and you're allowed up to 15 minutes of skating, if you're not shy!  The buffet they offered was a joke and I don't recommend doing it.  For 16.50, you're only allowed one trip through and other such silly stipulations... no thanks.   Other than that, what a great place to go!~~#~1
This is really worth taking the time to see and experience.  The cost is very low - $5 per adult.  The garden is beautiful and peaceful with many areas where you can sit by yourself and reflect or just people-watch.  Also, the lady in the gift shop is very helpful if you are a first time visitor.Metro Light Rail stop at Roosevelt and Central.~~#~1
Yum yum yum. Husband and I first went there early on a First Friday night and were pleasantly surprised to be seated right away. We didn't want anything too heavy since we were planning on doing some walking so we split the Spanish cheese plate which was delightful. The fig cake is delicious!! Splitting the plate made the bill pretty affordable and it was just enough to fill us up without overdoing it.The server was very helpful in suggesting a champagne for me and red wine for husband. Don't remember what we had but my champagne had a strawberry in it and was perfectly bubbly. Ambiance and decor is nice and mellow. We've since been back with friends and it has been enjoyable for both a date night and chatting it up with people. Enjoy!~~#~1
It's a hotel bar, so expect typical hotel pricing on drinks.  They have some good tapas to choose from, ask for the calamari, but a grilled version (off the menu)... it's REALLY good.  I've had a few of their drinks there, but I stick to the mojitos, but had plenty of others that were just as good.~~#~0
I hardly ever get past their carne adovada. It's simply amazing. Add a couple of extra homemade tortillas to it? Can't be beat! I have had their pecan crusted sea bass also, along with lamb chops (chipotle?) both very, very good. Great atmosphere, friendly, competent staff...a winning combination. Get there early! Long waits after 6:00pm!!~~#~1
Refused to give water to young teen & referred her to PF Changs.  Olive & Ivy handled this poorly, unprofessionally & pathetically. PF Changs didn't even hesitate to give her the water.  That's why I ate there instead.~~#~1
Great customer service, nice owner. The broth here is actually the best ive tasted in Arizona.~~#~1
A nice place to shop, but I wouldn't want to live there. I never used to be a department store shopper, but recently Ive discovered that nicer cloths just seem to fit better. Go figure. While I still like getting a deal, I usually wait until there is a clearance or sale or some type. The macy's at scottsdale fashion square seems to have more selection, such as more size options for the items you seem to like and a few more items to choose from also. For guys, I would suggest checking out the Dillards at fashion square; the mens dept is about the size of this entire macy's store. 2 or 3 times a year dillards has an awesome clearance event and you can pickup 65% off clearance prices; which are usually already 50 - 70% off the original price.I digress; this is supposed to be a review of macy's. If you're in the biltmore area and looking for higher end quality shopping go ahead and check them out, then travel down camelback to fashion square mall when they tell you the item you like is only available in your size at a different store.~~#~0
I liked the fish.  It was delicious.  The cole slaw was also very tasty.  Not too sweet.  A bit tangy.  I like that.  The shrimp was okay.  A bit rubbery, but then what does one might expect for a seafood place in the middle of a desert?My biggest problem with this place was the price of the food.  It is just too expensive for what amounts to frozen food plopped into a deep fryer.  I could buy frozen fish at the grocery store and then come home and plop it into my little deep fryer and it would taste about the same and be a lot cheaper.  I just wish it wasn't so expensive.  Especially considering this in the hood.  If you know what I mean.  I don't mind driving down to the hood for some fried fish, but only if it is reasonably priced.~~#~0
Yup. It's all true. Great food, super charming place, very intimate. We sat outside on the patio under a heat lamp. Enjoyed the olives as a starter, as well as some fried raviolis (yes, please) and a caprese salad app.  Outstanding artisan pizza, with as good a crust as I've ever had, and homemade mozzarella. Wine was just ok, but very reasonable. Server was attentive, helpful and friendly. Owner came by a couple times to check in on us and was absolutely delightful. Deduct a point for the proximity to the Handlebar J Saloon and the faux-cowboys arriving in limos with 10-gallon hats. Then add a point back for the near-fight we got to watch between a biker and the faux-cowboy who almost hit him with his Cadillac.We'll be back, and with more friends.~~#~1
Had a celebratory lunch for a colleague today. We had a group of ten. Service and ambiance were great. I had the best burger I can remember. It was Lon's special burger; expensive at $16 but worth every penny.  Highly recommend.~~#~1
The Family and I went back here on Saturday night. The food is just as spectacular as it was the first time we went! The service however was just not good. Our waiter seemed dazed and confused the whole time we were there. And slllllow. He also forgot stuff, I ordered a second glass of wine mid dinner and it never came, and I was never given the option to remind him because he did not come back until it was time to clear the plates! We sat at our table, all of us with empty plates for a good 10-15 minutes with out anyone coming by to clear them. We just sat there. Not cool, and its not like he was in another section, there was a table he was at 3 separate times that was directly behind ours, he just chose to ignore ours. We will go back as we do like the food and atmosphere and hopefully the service will improve.~~#~0
So I went here twice and I hated it the first time.  I don't know if I got a bad cut of meat or what, but my burrito was a bit too fatty.  I think it was the red chile burrito, or something.Having said that, I recently gave it another shot and and went for the carne asada burrito.  Very, very good.  The cut of the beef is a little thicker than the usual Salazar's or Filiberto's burrito, but it was really good regardless.  Oh, and the beans in there were awesome, too.  It didn't have guacamole and I didn't notice till it was too late, but I'll be sure to get some in there next time.Overall, I give it 3 stars because i really hated my first visit, but their carne asada is completely legit.~~#~0
This place is great!  I called at 8:30 am to make an appointment for that afternoon for 3 people.  The place wasn't open yet, but the phone was forwarded to I think the owner's cell.  He told me he would be at the store at 9:30 and he'd call me back when he had the schedule in front of him.  Sure enough, at 9:30 he called me back and was able to schedule our appointments for 3pm.When we got there we were immediately brought back to a small room that had 3 big, comfy chairs.  We sat down and a couple minutes later they brought in 3 tubs of warm water for our feet.  They reclined the chairs and started at our heads.  They massage your face, head, neck, shoulders, arms, hands, feet and calves.  The they tell you to turn over, as they quickly turn the recliner into a massage table and proceed to massage your whole back side....all fully clothed.  It was just wonderful....and all for $30!  I definitely recommend!~~#~1
i miss this place so much, it's insanity. ten high kentucky bourbon is all i can say.. and i never really cared how bad i felt the next day.~~#~1
I had business downtown this morning, so I stopped in here for lunch, right around the corner.  I used to go to OSF in Newport Beach, CA way back in the '70s, & I was somewhat amazed that they are still around & that there's one in Phoenix!Stepping inside, this is the most junked-up restaurant I've ever been to!!!  Ok, except maybe Bahooka Ribs & Grog!*  It's a big place, with soft lighting inside, & rooms all over the place stuffed with tons of furniture, barrels, & so on, cluttering up every one of them!  It's all on purpose, of course, & my booth in the midst of all this craziness was actually completely ok.  (The floor elevation is up & down all over the place, too!) Ok, so for my first time (in about 35 years!) I just ordered the "Pasta Classics - Rich Meat Sauce", which is their way of saying, "Spaghetti."Some good things:*  I started with a cup of coffee, & it was excellent!*  Pretty soon came a mixed lettuce salad, which was simple, but the Ranch Dressing was really tasty!*  The next thing to hit the table was a little loaf about three by eight inches of hot Sourdough bread, with a cup of whipped garlic butter, all on a breadboard with a suitable knife for cutting it.  It was great!!A couple of less wonderful things:*  Some girl (from the kitchen?) brought my spaghetti before I was finished with my salad.*  I thought the spaghetti sauce was ok, but not great.Bottom line:  They give you plenty to eat here.  My meal included the beverage, salad (or soup), the hot bread, entree, & dessert.  It was nice & filling, & a good value at $9.99 for everything.    :-)*  Rosemead, CA (& formerly also West Covina).~~#~0
Unlike other reviewers, I didn't like the buffet, though my friends from work think it's a good value. However, I've been going for dinner to Flavors of India for nearly three years now, and have ALWAYS liked the food. FOI is my first choice for Indian cuisine in Phoenix, out of the four other Indian restaurants in the valley I've tried. Yes, FOI is in a strip mall, but once inside, the ambiance is pleasant. It seems quite clean, I never got sick from anything I ate there (that's saying a lot, as I admit to being a fussy eater), and the waitstaff is helpful. Bollywood videos on the large flat-screen wall display in the corner are an unusual feature, but the volume is low or completely muted, so you can watch or choose not to, it isn't distracting.   (Here's a footnote about that: I ate at FOI on the night of the presidential primary election. My dining companion noticed that most of the waitstaff was gathered around the TV in the bar, watching electoral results, so he asked our waiter if we could watch too. After getting the enthusiastic okay from the two other occupied tables, it was quite late in the evening, silent Bollywood was replaced by live news coverage with volume turned on).Regarding the food: I love their mattar paneer (cooked peas in a tasty curried gravy, with small cubes of homemade mild-tasting cheese).  My super-spicy friend gets the lamb vindaloo (super-spiced as he requests).  Tandoori shrimp, chicken and tikka masala are good though a bit pricier, the samosa appetizer (lightly battered and deep-fried cut vegetables) is fresh, warm and crunchy. Regular and garlic nan bread are everything they should be, biryani rice is overpriced (I'd stick with basmati rice as a side dish), and sweet lassi (a well-chilled dairy drink, similar in taste and consistency to a vanilla yogurt smoothy) is a nice treat. My spicy friend says his gin-and-tonic was weak, and they don't have ingredients to make a Bloody Mary, but hey, FOI is an Indian restaurant, so I can't fault them too much for that! Other pluses: open a bit later than many Phoenix restaurants (seating ends at 9:30 pm); very fast with takeout orders; there's lots of parking; the 16 North bus stop is nearby; silverware, glasses, white cotton tablecloths and napkins are always spotlessly clean.~~#~1
Just had takeout from here. Amazing as always!!! Had the carne asada torta. DDelish!!!!~~#~1
The chicken was unreal good!  And, the cornbread, just as reviewers stated was heavenly.  It was light and very good!~~#~1
4 stars for the patrons that attended. good looking, generally friendly, and hardly any douchebags.2 stars for the cleanliness. I was there last night for a reserved, catered party and even though the food had run it's course on the patio, nobody cleaned it up. fantastic decor coupled with disgusting expired looking food2 stars for the bar service. ordered drinks three times and despite being at the barfront, it took 15mins each time to get a drink - which was generally underserved and overpriced. and this wait time wasnt just because sex girls were getting served... the bartenders were just that poor3 stars for the ambiance. music, staff, mood of the club. 2.75 stars overall. with places similar to this such as mabels and az88, i prob wouldnt go back to this place unless invited.~~#~0
I am a big fan of this place, either to stop in on a slow Sunday just to see what they have.  Their stock rotates pretty frquently so always new interesting things to find.  So far I've bought a vintage print, an awesome dress that I have received tons of compliments on, cool earrings, and some other kitchen items.  The staff are always friendly.  When you go, make sure you check out the Burt Reynolds beefcake poster they have behind the counter.Great strore!~~#~1

Dana, there is no other like Dana!  Even my kids ask to go visit her!   I have 4 children, 2 boys ages 3 1/2 and 5 1/2 and 2 girls ages 8 and 19 months.  Dana has been cutting their hair for quite some time. They all have a style of their own and have always been happy every time we leave. She has a great shop in Downtown Scottsdale, convenient and is very accomodating.  Highly recommended by this Mom and her children!!~~#~1
Great little place in a great little neighborhood. Food was great, service good and friendly and sitting amongst the rose bushes and garden made one feel as if we were having a nice relaxing Sunday breakfast in our backyard. Love the place.~~#~1
I don't know why I waited so long to try this place when it is literally right around the corner from my house.  I think its because I went to the one in Ahwatukee a long time ago and didn't care for the food.  But I don't think they have the same owners since the websites are totally different.  But anyway, on to the review.We ordered takeout and I was very impressed with how nicely it was all packaged and how quickly it was ready.  Also, the woman on the phone was very friendly, easy to understand in spite of an accent, and patient in explaining the menu items that I was unfamiliar with. All the appetizers sounded so good, we decided to get a bunch so the hubby and I could just pick at them since he was sick and didn't have much of an appetite.  However, the portions were bigger than expected so we ended up with quite a lot of food.  Lettuce wraps were very tasty, I loved the dressing on them.  Eggrolls were good but a little too much "wrapper" and not enough filling IMO.  Sweet potato chips were not what I was expecting, they were the white sweet potatoes that really don't have much taste to them and they were deep fried with I believe a panko breading on them.  A little bland but the sweet/hot dipping sauce they came with was fantastic.  I loved it so much I would order this again just for the sauce.  Also got some chicken soup for the sick hubby which I didn't try but he said was quite good. I threw in some pad thai noodles since that basic dish is always my test when evaluating a new Thai restaurant.  I asked for a four (out of five) on the spiciness scale and that was perfect for me.  I was very pleased at the heat level and overall flavor of the dish.  So many places hold back on the chiles if you are American, even if I insist I want it hot, and I have never understood why. The only thing missing was a squeeze of lime and garnish of fresh cilantro that I like on my pad thai.  Presumably you could get that upon request if you were dining in, it was no big deal to me since I had some at home.I still prefer Yupha's as the best Thai in the area.  But I will definitely be back here for takeout because of the friendly, speedy service and convenient location.  I noticed some wine bottles in the back when I was picking up my food so that may entice me to dine-in at some point as well.~~#~0
Why am I trying to hide my love...I'm at Gallo Blanco Cafe at least three times a week.  Yes, it's totally convenient.  But then again, so is that Rice Stick in a Bowl place around the corner and I'm never there!  I'm trading in my four stars for five stars.  I never get tired of the food (which is totally delish), the drinks, the jolt in the coffee, the servers...and THE HOTEL!!  You guys always treat me well, and I can see you treat everyone else like a rock star too.Thanks for being a great 'light rail convenient' local business!~~#~1
It was nice but not a great experience.  The music was very loud.    The waitress was very helpful and knew the menu and the wines and made some good recommendations (love the Newton Chard).  We split a salad and a pizza.  The watermelon salad was an incredible medley of complex flavors - the red chili giving the watermelon, avocado and goat cheese some kick to offset the sweetness.  Very interesting.  We got the funghi trifolati pizza and it was just ok.  After the first wonderful taste of mushrooms, it was all very bland with nothing to make it stand out.  I think next time I would try sitting on the patio as that looked very inviting and relaxing.~~#~0
love the food and the services ,but you neesd to weight at 350ib to eat the burgers for free, the burgers are big and jucey~~#~1
We found a bandaid with the panang.  We ordered panang with chicken, not panang with bandaid. When we told the waiter, he argued that it wasn't a bandaid.  I'm sorry, there's no mistaking a bandaid!  The icing on the cake was that they charged us for it!!!If you like bandaid on your dish, this I the place to go!Too bad yelp doesn't allow 0 stars. This place definitely was a ZERO.~~#~1
I love to come here from time to time when I'm in the area and I am always highly satisfied with the food and service. The menu is great and there's a variety of dishes for every taste. The service is great, everyone is always really nice and the atmosphere is quiet and relaxed. Definitely a great place to have dinner/lunch with friends. I read some other reviews from people who complained about the food, mostly these were meat eaters, I'm assuming, so of course they were not satisfied. This is a %100 vegan restaurant, note it.~~#~1
T. Cook's continues to be my go-to spot... with or without my fiance.  It's like my home away from home.  I feel comfortable going in for a drink or a bite to eat any night of the week.  Let me be clear about one thing, however - I always sit at the bar!In addition to the regular menu items, the burger at T. Cooks is consistently amazing. This sizable delight is carnivore candy for the soul. Ten ounces of tenderloin burger with white cheddar cheese, bacon and Guiness tempura onion rings on a ciabatta bun with a grain mustard aioli. My mouth is watering just thinking about it right now.Anyone up for a burger?~~#~1
I just started taking my car here a few months ago. Someone from their business stopped by my office building with donuts and coupons for a 60,000 mile check up, and that's how they got my business.I brought my car there for a routine oil change, and they did the 60,000 mile check up which was very useful. Of course there was the usual list of things I should fix, but they never made me feel like an idiot or that they were taking advantage of me, which I can't say for most mechanics.The other thing I really like about them is they give me a ride to and from work, so I can get maintenance done on my car without missing work or worrying about how I'm going to get back to the shop.Bill and the other guys that work there are all very friendly and I definitely trust them with my car needs.~~#~1
I love Lulus cupcakes! They always have a perfect amount of frosting and alot of their cupcakes are better than the ones at sprinkles. This is because they seem to be moister and hold themselves together better. I love the raven! The Sales people are nice. So yummy! And I love that the place is pink!~~#~1
I recommend this to everyone.  I have never had a bad meal here.  Inexpensive, great service, off the beaten path. Love this place.~~#~1
I've been going to Orange theory for awhile and I can't believe how much I've toned up and slimmed down!!! I haven't bulked up and now I'm on my way to getting my bikini body back!! I highly recommend this work out!! It's so awesome and I can't believe I can get my full work out in an hour!!!~~#~1
Oh my gooooooooodness!  I love this store.  I have been a tea enthusiast ever since I received a cast iron tea pot for Christmas.  A few weeks ago, I purchased a Groupon for $20 worth of merchandise for $10 and headed over to the store.  The experience was amazing.  The varieties were intriguing, the prices were reasonable, and the owner was very knowledgeable and friendly.  Also, the layout of the store was appealing and inviting.  When we visited the store, we received a packet of tea for the stores 1st birthday.  I hope there will be many more to come.~~#~1
After looking for a car wash & vacuum in the area I selectioned Francis & Sons. I checkeed thier priced on thier website, but when I got thier the price they wanted to charge was much more, they kept trying to sell an upholstery cleaning, and then said I don't take care of my care so there would be an additional $20 to clean the black plastic exterior pieces. I only wanted a qhick exterior  clean and vacuum. They refused to honor thier website pricing and insisted that what I read on thier website was not on there. Needless to say I didn't get my car washed there. I would highly recommend AVOIDING these crooks.~~#~1
I violated my rule of avoiding grocery shopping while hungry and decided to venture over to Whole Foods.  Whole Foods tends to be the indecisive individual's nightmare (that would be me).  Yet, this store is a foodie's dream. There are aisles upon aisles of glorious, wholesome products (pun intended).  Everything is meticulously organized and there are at least ten varieties of every type of item.  No joke.  It took me fifteen minutes to decide which brand of bottled tea would be suitable (and economical). I roamed the freshly prepared food section like a vulture circling it's prey...strategizing which choice would be the best taste sensation.  Did I want a made-to-order wrap?  Or a glass of wine and a couple tapas? (the live music was alluring)...Maybe sushi?  Pizza?  Salad bar?  Soup? Maybe something from the smokehouse...oooh! A cupcake from the cupcake bar? On and on it went. My final decision was sushi. The spicy tuna roll tasted fresh, and the Pacific salad roll was very crisp. I also grabbed a container of ginger for $1.99--not the artificially preserved pink variety--all-natural pickled ginger.  Bliss.  I purchased some cucumber salad from the salad bar as a side/palate cleanser. All in all, a very satisfying meal. Prices are a tad higher than your average grocery store. Then again, it is Whole Foods. A word of advise:  come with a game plan (e.g. a shopping list). If you don't define what it is you want prior to entering this store, you'll end up spending two hours and twice as much money than you anticipated.~~#~1
The sales people here are very knowledgable and helpful. They are also very friendly and great with reccomendations.I know it is a comic store but I only went there for DnD books/suppliments and ocassional Anime.I am pretty sure their Anime is bootleged, but due to how cheap it is and the fact that you usually can't find it anywhere else I don't care. They often come in complete sets for like 30 bucks which is great for a whole series. I have had problems watching them on PS2/Xbox sometimes but due to the price I keep coming back. Now then if it weren't for this next part they would have a 4 star.They no longer sell DnD books, or Dice sets which breaks my heart. They always had the best selection when it came to dice and I haven't been able to find another place that carries more than 5-6 at a time.Out of all the Atomic Comics I have been to I like this one the most, the people there are always fun and inviting I can't stress that enough.~~#~0
Beautiful little gem of a restaurant.  Great outdoor seating, amazing-truly amazing mussels.  Wholeheartedly recommend, perfect "date night" too.~~#~1
The restaurant itself is not fancy and does not have an amazing atmosphere, but I really love the food here. I've eaten in the restaurant a few times and frequently get takeout. I love the Gobi Manchurian, Vegetable Vindaloo, and Special Vegetable Curry. I also like the weekend buffet - it's a great way to try several different things. Delicious!~~#~1
Beyond the attractive decor and nice food-presentation, I wasn't all that impressed by True Food. Certainly the concept of healthy, sustainable, locally bought food is great (albeit in the form of an upscale-chain), but overall, True Food didn't live up to the hype.On the positive side, the edamame dumplings with daikon radish and white truffle oil were extremely tasty, and my Ginger Margarita was excellent. On the not-so-positive side, the raw ahi tuna app-special was just OK, and the tiny slivers of fish (maybe 8 total?) were more of a "taste" than a full appetizer. Even worse, my chicken sausage pizza was slightly burnt on the bottom, and tasted bland and uninspired -- the sausage was finely ground and lacked much flavor, and the fennel was invisible. Added to the long wait (weekend dinner reservations are a must even though the restaurant is huge) and the pay-parking lot (if you stay more than two hours, which we did because of the long wait), we all came away mildly disappointed.With many other excellent Phoenix-area restaurants to choose from, we'll head elsewhere next time.~~#~0
This place does not need another review, but I'll chime in anyway.I have been dreaming of coming her for several months after countless hours of drooling over their website.I went for a late lunch with the Gorgeous Gabi.  We had the restaurant all to ourselves, it was quiet and comfortable.I ended up just ordering a salad, it was so hot out (surprise) and I just wanted something light. I got a Diet Coke and the Caesar Romero Salad (see pics) it consisted of; mixed greens with cilantro dressing, grilled lemon/herb chicken, fontina, cherry tomatoes and toasted pepitas. It was really good, I like the mixed greens in place of the usual romaine and although I didn't taste much cilantro it had great flavor.Our waitress was not very attentive at all, when she did come around to grab my empty glass of soda she did not ask me if I'd like another, instead she brought me a glass of water.........with a bug in it! I'm giving 3 stars for now, but I will go back because there are still quite a few things on the menu I'd like to try.~~#~0
This has to be the worst restaurant in terms of hygiene. Two of my friends had food -poisoning after having dinner here. The food is just unhealthy with tons of oil floating on the top of curries, and I am not sure if any health/hygiene code is followed here. The service is poor and the information on its website is incorrect, the owner does not allow dine-in after 9 or 10 even though it says that the restaurant is open till 11. One night I saw the owner cleaning the place without gloves and she was nice enough to give us a to-go parcel without cleaning her hands (great example to the servers!). I had a peek inside the kitchen when the door was ajar, and it definitely looked dirty.I have been a lot of hole-in-the-wall places around this restaurant, including Haji Baba, the Vietnamese place and others, but neither any of my friends nor I have fallen sick coz of the food. If you need a spicy-food fix, i strongly recommend you do not try this place, lest you want a visit to the doctor the very next day.~~#~1

Once we went to Grimaldi's in Hoboken, NJ and weren't all that impressed.  Yet the first time we ate at this Grimaldi's, we were blown away!  Upon entering, you are enveloped by the aroma of pizza baking in a coal-fired oven.  This is swoon-inducing---and I mean that in a good way.  The smell almost has you believing that you are in a pizza joint with a coal-fired oven in the Northeast.When ordering pizza baked in a coal-fired oven, I like to get a plain cheese pizza.  IMO, this is the best way to fully taste the sauce, cheese and crust without anything else get in the way.  There's nothing like a thin crust pizza from a coal-fired oven with that char on the crust.  The crust has just the right balance of crispy and soft.  The sauce is well flavored with proper proportions of basil and oregano.  The amount of cheese is just right.  I love to savor each and every bite.There is more to this Grimaldi's than the one under the Brooklyn Bridge.  This one has other items in addition to the pizza.  We like their antipasto.  It has sliced mozzarella which is fresh and creamy, black and green olives (the black ones are pitted, the green ones have pits in them),  roasted red pepper slices which are bursting with flavor, and a good, flavorful salami.Everytime we're in AZ, it is so worth it to us to deal with the heavy traffic in Old Town Scottsdale to dine at Grimaldi's!~~#~1
Ok, this is coming from sombody that is not a fan of the Cheesecake factory.My cousin, her friend, and I walk into the the restaurant and decided to eat in the bar area.  We had a very sweet waitperson, Summer.  She rocked with suggestions and her personality was great.  I had one of their smoothies, just like the one at Cheesecake Factory.  It was good, but I have had better at Jumba Juice.  I ended up having their angel hair pasta, my cousin had a chicken salad, and friend #3 decided that he would just mooch off our plates.  The reason why I hate these types of places is that they give you WAY TOO MUCH FOOD!  Why do they do that?  Especially with people, like me, that learned that they better clean off their whole plate? I just gained 10 pounds.Food was nothing spectacular.  My cousin then ordered the Splenda Cheesecake, that she said tastes horrible. (She had the one at Cheesecake Factory, which she thinks is awesome)5 stars to the lovely Summer (or was it Winter...I can't remember now...crap!)  My cousin actually left her money on the booth.  She called the restaurant and Summer actually said she found it and was holding it for her just in case she came back for it.  Extra plus for honesty that I didn't even think existed in the world anymore.  2 stars for the mediocre food.  And 3 stars to the host stand...a story that I don't have enough energy to even type here.~~#~0
Terrible service--they replaced my phone screen and it broke within 2 wks. Phone was not dropped or mishandled, just cracked and "owner" would not honor their warranty. They only accept cash--that should be a red flag if you are considering a business like this!~~#~1
Championship establishment here.I walked in with my significant other and was surprised at how busy it was on a Tuesday night. At first, it didn't click but the entire volleyball team from a nearby high school decided to come so it was extremely busy.They have some really good specials, but what really caught my eye was the specialty burgers that are $6. Big misunderstanding, most $6 are single patty and have some special toppings. Zipps decided to do a double-stacked specialtly burger. Yes, two 1/3 lb patties on a bun with some special toppings. We got two burgers and split them half and half, green chile burger and sweet jalapeno. Both were extremely awesome. You can get salad, fries, onion rings or half-half (half fries half onion rings). The fries kind of taste like In-n-Out fries, and my significant other would describe them as being better. I don't agree, and I don't disagree. Overall, good food, I can't wait to come back and try something else from their special menu. The $6 specialty burgers are available Tuesdays from 8-close and weekends from 11-4.The service was really awesome. They definitely cared about us and went out of their way to make sure we were doing okay. I think they felt guilty that we were there when a huge group was there as well. Apparently, they also were understaffed, but it honestly did not feel like it. Seriously though, it was some of the best service I've ever had at a Phoenix restaurant. To top it all off, the manager had checked up on us a few times, and at the end after we paid the bill he brought us a cookie platter (pizzookie, or cookie with ice cream).Now, I'm not a fan of pizzookie, but wow, their cookie platter was awesome. It wasn't on special that night, but I know its on special some other night and at $4 its probably worth a go again. Might I say one more thing about the cookie platter? It's just as good if not better than BJ's.I am actually excited to go here again. With some really good food specials almost any night, I think if I ever run out of ideas this might be the first place I think of. The food is a little greasy, but I think that is expected when you go to a sports grill. Want to lose 50 lbs, go to subway. Props to the owners for such an awesome establishment.~~#~1
This place is amazing! The food was delicious, the waffle was like no other.  The service was great, very attentive and nice. I will be returning.~~#~1
It's Pei Wei. The service and food are always satisfactory.~~#~0
We make it a tradition to come here whenever family is in town. So I've probably been here atleast 10 times.Love their steak with buttered plates. We've had it before where the streak wasnt cooked to our satisfaction. But after being there so many times I know how to order it. Sweet potato casserole is excellent. Cesar salad is the best I've ever had. On this occasion the wait staff was very friendly, but I've had it before where they are like buzzing bees. I usually like to have tea after dinner which is always nice. The atmosphere is good. It is nicer to sit in the main dining area near the windows instead of the side room.Also people if you are going to spend hundred dollars on dinner, don't cheap out on a babysitter. Nobody wants to listen to your whinnying little brat kids who can't sit still. Ruth Chris should have an age requirement!I've been to Mortons twice. Once in Chicago and once in Phoenix and both times it wasn't as good as Ruth Chris.~~#~1
Postinos on the East side!?Whoa, you like to think that you're immune to Postinos, oh yeahIt's closer to the truth to say I can't get enough You know I'm gonna have to face it, I'm addicted to Postinos Thanks Robert Palmer and let's just say I wouldn't be surprised to see the fashion models around here.  Very attractive crowd!  I am honor just to be here!  Another bottle of wine and you'll be mine, a one track mind I can't be saved 4 flavors of Bruschetta is all I crave If there's some left for you and don't mind if I do I might as well face it I'm addicted to PostinosI've always enjoyed attending Postinos on the West side of town, but the East side adds a new flavor.  The place still has a great deal on Monday and Tuesday nights.  Bottle of wine plus a large plate of bruschetta's for $20!  The ambience is always chill and low lighting.  Quite romantic and add some pretty ladies and I'm golden here!  Service is always great at Postinos.  The staff is definitely well train in the knowledge of wine and their service is spectacular! - Enjoy!~~#~1
Rula Bula gets five stars from me for two reasons:#1 Perfect fish and chips.#2 One of the only correctly poured Guinness drafts in AZ.They could punch me in the neck when I walked in, and i would still give them five stars for those two reasons.Almost all the food is good (though I can count the number of times I've had anything other than the above on one hand). The happy hour is great, with half off appetizers, including the fish nuggets, which are the fish 'n' chips I eat before I eat the fish 'n' chips.The world's most competitive trivia night. These people STUDY for trivia night. Great outdoor seating, good service. Decor is interesting, especially if you like this particular famous race horse that I currently forget the name of but is the subject of approximately 90% of the wall art.~~#~1
One of my favorite places to come. Their salsa and guacamole is to die for. I like that they bring each person their own individual bowl of salsa. I ways get their huevos rancheros with beans and rice + homemade flour tortilla. Delicious!!!I eat the entire plate every time.~~#~1
Great place, enjoyed the amenities. Pool was great and view on the property was very picturesque. Food in the property restaurants were very good. Definitely would stay there again if ever in Scottsdale again.~~#~1
What would I do without this place?  They pretty much anything you need to make any Asian home cooked meals.  Very clean.  Fresh produce, fresh seafood, fresh meat.  I love how they have pre sliced meats.  This is definitely one of the largest Asian supermarkets in the valley.  Avoid the the 2 asian restaurants in the market though.  They're not very good.~~#~1
love. Love. LOVE.How can you not fall in love with this store the moment you walk in is beyond me. It's like entering that magical fairy tale land your mind goes to every time I start to sing or sit down at my piano. And that's exactly what a music store should be. It should bring you to that creative center where the outside world doesn't exist. First and foremost, the staff is extremely friendly, both on the phone and in person. I've spent I don't know how much of their time having them assist me in finding sheet music and they've always been a gem and even gone so far as to go google searches for me while I was there and give me some additional leads. It's just an awesome amazing experience. They also never seem to mind me going in and gawking at instruments for hours on end. I always tell myself someday I am going to learn a new instrument, and going in there causes me to think of at least 10 I want to play... especially when I stare at the drums.Go to Milano and experience what a music store is supposed to be.~~#~1
I've decided to up the rating of this place to 3 stars because I went back for a second try. (it was close to work)  This time the burger actually had juices left.  They still wont cook it less then well done which puts me off but at least it had flavor this time.I still dont recommend this place when you can spend a bit more and get a real burger at FEZ, Zinburger or Delux.~~#~0
I'm going to have to work through this review before I decide on 3 or 4 stars. I've been thinking about this since my visit and I cannot seem to come to a conclusion. Another one of those times I wish we had half star options.The Parlor is definitely The Vig's little baby sister. It Aesthetically looks extremely similar, it has both the same Scottsdale-esque vibe and crowd, both are in weird, out-of-the way locations, and both are really loud. Even for a new restaurant with lots of buzz on a Saturday night, I thought this place was crowded. There was over a 45-minute wait for two of us, so we ended up grabbing a beer at the bar. I'm glad we did because our bar tender was smokin hot. Nothing better for the self esteem of two broken-hearted girls than a cute, flirty bartender. After a while we just decided to eat at the bar and skip the whole table idea. Good choice, even though the bar area was REALLY loud. On to the food... we started out with the cheezy cauliflower appetizer. OH MY GOOD LORD. It was amazing. It was topped with bread crumbs and baked... it was just absolutely amazing. It was good later as a midnight snack and good as breakfast the next morning. For dinner we shared a Pesto and a Margharita pizza. I loved both of them, but the Margharita had more flavor and I preferred it over the Pesto. Both had great quality ingredients and were extremely tasty.I'm pretty stoked that the prices are so reasonable. Two hours, five beers, an appetizer and two pizza's later, we ended up with a bill for $50 plus tip. My solo bar tabs are normally higher than that!My major complaint, though, was the whole entire time I was there I had a stuffed nose. I don't know if it was an allergy to something they were cooking, the wood, flowers, etc but I could barely breathe. The second we stepped outside it was like I had a new nose.Man.. I still don't know... three ... four... three ... four... okay .. my decision is made: if the 6' tall snobettes coming into the bathroom as we were walking out didn't smash rudely into my dining partner and act like she was Antichrist for trying to inhabit the same place at the same time, I would definitely go with a 4 but it's a 3 for now until things settle down a bit.~~#~0
What else can I say that hasn't been said already?  I'm weirdly glad that they're not closer ( in fact very far away from me) because I'll be there every day = gaining tons of weight!My baby loved the mango lassi flavor! So much he did the sign for "more " for the first time at the store:)I do want to try the bacon flavor....so a trip soon is in order~~#~1
my husband and i stayed on a monday night just as a 'stay-cation' and it was busier than i had expected. HUGE bed and very comfy. the AC buzzed  off and on all night and we didn't have the bathrobes that were advertized online. BUT the rooftop deck had a nice view and the breeze was welcomed. we got a drink from the bar and took it up to the roof with us. the pool looked very inviting but there were too many kids splashing around for us to want to venture in.overall it was a good experience and not bad for the discount rate that we found. we were definitely impressed by the huge bed.~~#~0
LOVE THIS PLACE!  We eat here every Saturday as long as we are in town.  My husband eats here during the week too!  Weekday lunches are a great deal and quick!  The veggie soup is delicious.  The golden wings - Delicious... chicken satay is good too.  For an entree... we always get Pad Prik King chicken or sometimes shrimp but its always always delicious!  Have been trying to find a thai place with this dish closer to home (east valley) but haven't found one yet!  Service is terrific!  FYI for those of you who just order Pad Thai... it is very sweet here so if you don't like it sweet... order something else.  Other things we've tried that were good... pepper steak - very good - just dont eat a lot of red meat, massamum curry with chicken good... also we order everything medium to thai hot... like very spicy!~~#~1
Prices are good nobody is down your throat when you enter and its the best place for produce in town literally would suggest this place over trader joe's for sure~~#~1
I found this place via Google while in town for business. It's tucked away in a non-descript strip mall next to a Salvation Army.I've had dinner and lunch here, both times were good. For dinner, I had the special turkey sandwich with fries (fries weren't pipping hot when they were served, but still good); for the lunch visit, I had the original "g" spicy po-boy and chose the curry pasta salad as a side - tasty!Service was friendly and efficient._______________Update: 12/10/07 - What's the first thing I do when I arrive in Phoenix? Punch in 2240 N. Scottsdale Road in my GPS and head to Green! This time around I had Thee Argentine Po-Boy with fried - Mock steak fried with onions and peppers, vegan mayo and a spicy sauce. I couldn't get enough! Very delicious12/11/07 - After having a veggie burger and fries for lunch at a Hard Rock Cafe, I thought I'd balance it out by having something healthy for dinner - I ordered the Diablo Rice bowl with chicken and brown rice. The description looked good: veggies in a spicy sauce - but it was a little too salty for my taste and didn't finish it. Oh well, can't win them all.12/12/07 - I was working close by, so decided to run in for lunch. I ordered the No Harm Chicken Parm sandwich with a side of tahini coleslaw. It was a little bit messy to eat by hand, with the tomato sauce and soy mozzarella oozing everywhere - still good nonetheless. The coleslaw was a nice compliment to the sandwich.12/14/07 - I'll miss you Green!~~#~1
No need for a long review.Every In-N-Out I have ever been too has been amazing.Great FoodGreat Customer ServiceLove this place~~#~1
I love Petco! The only place I go to get dog food. I feel like the employees generally know what they are talking about and are always willing to help!~~#~1
Wow, is this some fantastic food! It was the first non chain restaurant we ate at during our vacation and I couldn't be more pleased. Not only was the staff friendly and attentive, the food was phenomenal. Presentation and taste were top notch. The Tai fried rice was the best fried rice I've ever had. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in town.Visit Date: 11/18/09~~#~1
I like this place because of how original it is and the menu has something for everyone.Unfortunately it is tucked away in a hard to spot location and therefore continues to be a great secret.I would recommend to anyone in Arizona to make a trip over and see what this place is all about. I think everyone will be happy with it.~~#~0
LOVE this place. Great food, high quality ingredients (which is why i was told the prices are a bit more than your typical pizza hut), and fun service.I love this place, and always leave happy and full. Authentic italian food is my weak spot! :)~~#~1
Really good prices but I would stray from the wings. It is very greasy so beware!~~#~0
Have been an Ulta customer for a long time, but had never tried the salon until recently.  Was a HORRIBLE experience.  My stylist, Delia, ran 45 minutes late to start me, and on several occasions during the hair cut, stopped and kept looking around.  She made various odd faces as if to say my hair was a mess.  She not only didn't listen to what I wanted, but shot down the only thing I did ask for.  She said I wouldn't look good.  At the end of the painful ordeal, she then charged me for a conditioning service I didn't ask for.  At that point she directed me to the line at the front of the store, after which I waited in, they then sent me back to the salon to make the price correction.  (happened twice, then I asked for a manager)  Was very unprofessional all around and would NEVER go back!!!~~#~1
Sadly, I have to join the crowd on this one. I was hoping that Kitchen 56 would make my memories of Vatra go away, but instead just reminded me all over again. Food was WAY overpriced and just OK. Kudos to Eddie the Server who brought with him the only charm available the second time we tried K56; I'd give him 4 stars if the review were based solely on his service & personality. I will say the interior is much better than the previous incarnation, but the spots (lights) at the counter-height 4 top shone in my eyes and made me feel like it was last call...and I don't drink.~~#~1
We loved this place.~~#~1
One of favorite happy hour places in town. If you get the wings here it shouldn't matter if you get anything else. Great location and nothing else needs to be said. Maybe a renovation on the parking lot.~~#~1
I visited Carly's for a weekday lunch when I was downtown for work. Here is the rundown:1) parking is horrid - common downtown, so take the lightrail (the stop is on Central and Roosevelt) or bring a fist full of quarters for the meter2) it is crowded! well it was when I was there3) the service was pretty good considering how swamped it was and I told the nice server I was in a hurry and she was able to take my order from soup to nuts in maybe 10 minutes even though their credit card machine was down4) I ordered a gyro and their orzo pasta salad, the gyro was mediocre and bland but the pasta was wonderfulI will definitely try Carly's again when I am not rushed, the interior is hipster, funky, low key and the staff was very friendly.~~#~0
Love the wings!~~#~1
Simple but really great cajun food prepared in steamers right in front of you.  Selections include gumbo, pan roasts (a tomato-based broth with chunks of seafood), or seafood creole all with your choice of shrimp, crab, chicken, crawfish, oysters, or all five, with rice. They also have fresh oysters, jumbo shrimp cocktails, salads, and tasty seafood chowder, as well as the occasional lobster special. I've been probably 20 times and still never had a bad dish. The staff is friendly and helpful, and will adjust the spiciness of the dishes to your taste. By far the best option at the Talking Stick resort.As another reviewer noted, this restaurant is really just a bar with a couple of tables, stuck right off the casino floor. This is definitely not a fine dining spot, with the clanging of slot machines and dead-eyed gamblers shuffling around fifteen feet away. Still, it's definitely worth a visit to Talking Stick. At $10-12 for lunch portions and $17-19 for huge dinner servings, and $25 for a massive platter of oysters, shrimp, crab, mussels, and clams, it's a fantastic value for the quality and tastiness of the food.  Good, reasonably priced seafood can be hard to come by in the valley, but this spot is a gem.~~#~1
Sometimes it's difficult to really feel satisfied with a raw vegan diet , but every time I go to Pomegranate's I leave more than satisfied.   The atmosphere is welcoming and delightful, although very busy during the lunch rush. I did have to share a table with a stranger last time I was there but the stranger turned out to be a great lunch companion.  This is a must for anyone who is considering (or already is) a raw and/or vegan diet.  Everything is so yummy you won't know it is good for you!~~#~1
Simply awesome! Great beer and great staff! Will try the food next time! Only complaint is a bartender named Adrianne she is crazy! Ha! GThe food was excellent from the great hard boiled egg dish to the peanut butter and jelly with banana and marshmallow fluff oh and add bacon.  Elvis just did a sommersault in his grave.  The sandwiches are not huge but they are all made like the beer served and the people hosting, of finest quality!  Really enjoyed and will spread the word!~~#~1
Best breakfast in west Chandler!  I love their crepe eggs and calorie/nutritional info printed on the menu.~~#~1
Not that good, not that bad.  So-so, more or less.Stopped by here for lunch the other day, I had the BBQ chicken lunch.  Overall a pretty bland taste, but maybe that is just the style.  If I ever end up here again I may try something else, but I won't be going out of my way to do so.~~#~0
While we were in Mesa AZ for a holiday we found Alessia's on Yelp and we are so glad we did. The food was delicious and the host was terrific as were the servers. We are not big wine drinkers but they have a very good selection of wines and the host knows his stuff and can make good recommendations. Nicely appointed little restaurant with a great menu.~~#~1
I used to go here about once a week when I still lived and worked in Arizona. My office at the time was within walking distance.This is a very good Hooters location...located smack dab in the middle of Mill Avenue right next to ASU. Plenty of stores all around. I used to go mainly for lunches during the week with co-workers. It usually was quieter than evenings or weekends. The serving staff were great and many of the ladies would stand and chat for quite a while...as it was pretty slow.~~#~1
Despite it's name (which gave me moment for pause when deciding if I wanted to check it out), Xtreme Bean is a hip coffee house with a college feel (they even have a "study room" with quasi-cubicles that is ironically placed in what used to be a bank vault). Further, for those of you that spend hours on end in coffeehouses, THEY HAVE FREE WI-FI :-DThe "coffee flavored coffee" and tropical ice tea are good (I personally tend not to stray into more interesting coffee drinks, so you'd have to check those out yourself) and the entire selection of both food and drinks is very reasonably priced (compared to corporate coffee).As of this post, there is ragtime piano on Monday nights as well as performers on the weekends.They have a drive-through window.Oh yeah, they don't appear to have updated their website in quite some time... most importantly, their hours of operation. The website says they are open 24-hours on the weekend... but I *think* they are closing at 1am in the summer.EDIT: Go for the pumpkin muffins... they are most excellent.EDIT 2: Due to the recent rise in popularity of this coffeehouse, I can no longer get my beloved muffins as they all sell out long before I arrive at night. *tear* Oh yeah... and all the employees probably think I'm that crazy muffin guy. *shrugs*EDIT 3: I'm officially downgrading my review from a 4 to a 3 as it's now difficult to get a table indoors and I have no interest in sitting in the smoker's lounge which is their patio area. *sigh*~~#~0
After visiting family in Scottsdale last weekend, hubby and I spent 3 wonderful days at the Boulders Resort in Carefree. We arrived a little tired and stressed; we left tan, relaxed, and rejuvenated.The resort sprawls beneath the boulder formations, but you can walk all over on the paths that are well marked. Our room was spacious and clean, with his and hers sinks in the bathroom, shower, tub, king sized bed, and walk-in closet. We were located near the main lodge, and a brisk walk from El Pedregal and the Golden Door Spa. We made great use of the wonderful fitness center and took a few classes as well- yoga, bosu, and water fitness.We tried both pools during our stay, the spa pool and the main pool. We preferred the tranquility of the spa pool; food and drinks at both locations were exceptional. If you meet Madonna at either pool, ask her to make the "Madonna Special" for you. A very refreshing smoothie.During our stay we ate dinner twice at the Spotted Donkey Cantina at El Pedregal- fabulous margaritas shrimp tacos. Our last night we dined at Rusty's Chop House at the golf club. It was a lovely meal on the terrace with a view of the golf course. Every person we ran into was exceptionally friendly and genuine, making the trip even more enjoyable. I hope we return someday!~~#~1
They have the BEST Pad Thai!  I've had many other dishes of theirs which are all delicious, but that Pad Thai haunts my dreams at night. (In a good way)  I've recently had Touch of Thai which is a highly rated Thai Food restaurant.  Of course, I had to try their pad thai.  Honestly, It was just as good, but they used the thin, stringy noodles and Dara uses the wide, flat noodles.  You wouldn't think that would make much of a difference, but that's what makes me drive 20 miles more to go to Dara Thai to get their Pad Thai than driving 5 miles to go to Touch of Thai. If your not watching your calorie intake I highly suggest getting the cream cheese wontons and Thai Tea with your Pad Thai!  Now that's what I call delicious!~~#~1
Baffled by the unfavorable reviews here. Easily one of the best burgers I've ever had is the Zinburger. Truffle fries are also delicious. Always have good service here and leave very satisfied. Atmosphere is slightly upscale I suppose, but not snobby as some complain. You can wear shorts and a T-shirt and feel right at home here.~~#~1
This place is what Desert Ridge wishes it was! Its great for groceries (Wal-Mart), bargain hunting (TJ Maxx), fast food or dining in (tons of places!), catching a movie (Harkins), stocking up the wine shelf (BevMo), new panties (Vicky's Secret) and a zillion other things. I love that this is close to my house! The only thing that would make it better is a Costco or Sam's Club.~~#~1
We got the Wiseguy with Wood Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, and Fennel Sausage.  I was very underwhelmed.  The pizza was really greasy and just not all that great-tasting.  Also the crust was burnt in several places, making it taste even worse.~~#~0
When I'm on vacation, I try to go to restaurants I try to avoid chains because what's the point?  I want to eat local eats.  As I walked in, I realized I've been to the one in Long Beach, CA though the menu was completely different. Or perhaps it was the late night menu but it was decidely more "Southwestern."  Ah well, it had been several years and it was quite late at night so it didn't matter at this point.I ordered the green pork tostada which the waiter assured me was very small and the hot wings. The tostada was huge. What a liar (yes, I called him that to his face). I ate a couple of bites and finished the wings. I would have the tostada cold and congeal-y in the morning before flying out. Surprisingly, the flavors were locked in this way and acceptable as a 5-minute scarf fest. Oh, and my vodka tonic was very good.  Not bad and I kind of dug our picnic style bench high top table.~~#~0
I eat here often because it is close to where I live. Good clean Chines food but it is all starting to taste the same like they use the same sauce on many of their dishes. It didn't used to be like that. I will keep going because it is still good and the best in the area IMHO, but it is time for a menu change to get some new flavors for those who eat there often.~~#~0
Can I tell you how much I despised Fate with all its pretentious, snooty bullshit? I should have known the second I realized that Bliss/reBar was in the same building that it was probably tainted from all the leftover evil.And so it is. We showed up and the restaurant was practically empty. There is no hostess or even a hint of one. We stood there for many minutes on end before even being acknowledged by one of the many servers who were rushing around (perhaps serving to invisible people? The place was dead.). We were told there was a 15 minute wait, or we could eat on the patio. Um, it's 40 degrees...  AND THE PLACE WAS DEAD. I guess we'll wait. We go back outside because there is zero point zero extra room to stand. The server comes back out and says they have two large parties coming in an hour, but we can sit inside now if we can be done in 45 minutes. That's sure inviting, isn't it.So we hustle on inside and make some hasty selections. $9 faux comfort food shit like gourmet mac and cheese just offends me, so I go with the veggie sandwich. That sounds innocuous enough, right? The food came out straightaway - too fast for a burger to be cooked medium well, like my companion ordered. Sure as shit, she cut into it, and it was bleeding and mooing all over the place. My "veggie" sandwich arrives and it looks like a Filet-o-Fish from hell, some huge block of something unidentifiable due to extreme deep-frying. I couldn't help it - I asked the server what the hell it was. Eggplant.Ohhhhkay then. It was like trying to eat a deep fried brick between two pillows. Impossible. The pretzel bread, while yummy, is totally unyielding. Only Jenna Jameson can fit that thing into her mouth. My companion was suffering a similar fate with her bleeding burger. There was mayonnaise and shredded cabbage and boiling hot eggplant juice going everywhere and it was goddamn ridiculous. Neither of us got through even a half of our sandwiches. I wolfed down the side salad just to get something remotely healthy in there after the onslaught of grease, although I almost choked on the buckets of sugar syrup they call salad dressing.So, while we are attempting to recover from this mess, the server goes MIA. You'd think if they were trying to hustle us out of there, we'd get a damn check. Nope. No. Nada. Had to chase someone down and ask for it. When it finally came, there wasn't even an itemized receipt, so even though the total seemed a little low I couldn't check it out. I was so over the whole experience at the point I didn't even care. I left a shitty tip and we escaped to the bar next door, where the cute bartenders gave us some free drinks and we sucked down innumerable $3 vodka specials for the next four hours. Just UGH in every way.~~#~1
Had the mahi and it was great.  Very reasonably priced also.  Definitely a repeat.~~#~1
I have been living in Arizona for 4 years and have yet to find a decent Italian Beef Sandwich, until now.  I even gave the same statement to the owner.  I had ordered an Italian Beef for carry out, and while I was waiting, I let him know my frustrations.  He gave me his card and told me to call him after I ate the sandwich because he wanted to know what I thought.  Well, it was FANTASTIC!  Of course, I called him back to let him know.  The service, and the time and effort put into the food cannot be beat.  This is what you get for a mom and pops type place.  There are plenty of other sandwiches and foods there too.  I can't wait to go back and try some more!~~#~1
This place is just so so rad. It was about time that AZ has a high end sneaker boutique.The selection of sneakers as well as clothes is above all. No kidding. I bought a pair of limited edition Jordans as a gift here. All of the sneakers here a so unique and fun, and it really puts the fun in sneaker shopping again. Sure, you can go to finish line and get a pair of sneakers there. And you will see various other people wearing the same ones. If you really want to find funky stuff to express yourself with, this is the place. AND to make it even better...they sell for retail! So markups? Not an issue.Do yourself a favor and check this place out...~~#~1
3.5 stars. Needed a place to avoid the rain before going to see Tron with my mom at the movie theater next door. We didn't order food, just drinks. There's an OSF in Seattle, and having gone a couple times, while not super familiar with the menu, I know what they serve. Our waitress was actually really awesome- she got us our drinks quickly and was super friendly with our touristy butts. Yeah... it's a chain. I know the food isn't the best and the service can be hit or miss. But the stars are all for our waitress, whose name I (of course) can't remember. I got the OSF version of a Jack and Coke, which had a cherry infused whiskey (it was dangerous, and at 7 dollars, doubly so), and my mom got a virgin Daquiri- our waitress put extra whip on it. A little touch, but one my mom really appreciated.~~#~0
Dr. Jason Kanarish is absolutely amazing.  I am a Physician Assistant in surgery, and  appreciated his "bedside" manner as well as medical knowledge, which was phenomenal.  He spent AMPLE TIME with me and answered EVERY QUESTION I had.  Not to mention, he was fantastic with my scared min pin. I cannot recommend him enough.  The staff is also extremely friendly and helpful!~~#~1
Nice selection of stuff, but they have so little help available you will wait for darn near forever to get fabric cut, THEN wait in line forever to pay.  For such a giant store, it appears there are 3 employees.  That's it.  I miss Hancock Fabrics, THEY knew how to treat customers.~~#~1
Just open.  I had the roast beef sandwich and my wife had the turkey and stuffing sandwich.  Both were excellent, modern interpretations on classic lunches.  I highly reccommend this place.P.S.:  iPad driven POS system is way cool.~~#~1
I don't frequent Tempe too often, but when I do, I try to get a Tea Infusion run in... everytime I succeed, I literally have a grin on my face after every sip. It's the least strip mall-esque dining option in the whole of Tempe Market place and that is a BIG PLUS in my book. Add to that that they make Boba Smoothies the way I like them... how could I resist?Case in point: The Pumpkin Chai. Based off the rattlings of fellow yelpers, I decided to try the chai and asked if it could be boba-fied (which makes me want to say Boba Fet) and they said "SURE!" It was delish, but that was summer and now it's winter and so warm sounded yummy but I had never had a hot boba drink before. So I asked them if I could have it with boba and hot and what did they say? "SURE! But be careful it's hot." And oh so YUM!I think they deserve the taglines "Have it your way" and "Any way you want it" more than Burger King! Because out of all the Boba places in Metro Phoenix they are the only ones that have never said "No" to me before with Boba Juice coming in a close second.... but only because their range of options is less.Add to that that they have a Boba Smoothie called Carribbean Colada and it is a pretty comparable alternative to my favorite Pineapple Lychee flavor that only the now defunct AZN of Mesa could prepare for me... so with just 2 of their drink options I am in Boba heaven... wonder what else they have in store for me if I ever tire of my usual options and try something different... don't know if I can... I might have to do a gluttonous double order or sip-taste from a friends selection.But wait... Boba's not all they've got, they've got a tea list comparable to that of Cheesecake Factories menu... it is a long one... I've had a blueberry tea, strawberry and a coconut one and they were all pretty tasty. I've also had a panini there and it was quite tasty and filling--I took leftovers home.My only wish is that the space Tea Infusion is housed in was more spacious with lounge seating in addition to table options so one can really settle in and work or chat with friends, but heck, I'm just happy they're here and serving the valley some tea-tastiness.I'll tea back REAL SOON!~~#~1
We purchased a Groupon deal and went and tried this restaurant . The food is excellent and the service is very good . If you are wanting real Texas BBQ then this is the place to go!~~#~1
Hmm, a bit disappointed. I had been here several times when I used to live in Scottsdale, but that was 3+ years ago, and I must say that I think things have gone downhill here. The bruschetta toppings on the combination platter were odd for the most part, with the exception of the traditional fresh tomatoes and basil, which was delicious and worth mentioning. The provolone on the sausage bruschetta was excessive and the overall combination of flavors just didn't work. The pesto bruschetta was SUPER garlic-heavy, even for someone like me who loves garlic. I couldn't finish either of the latter types of bruschetta. Onto the main course - pizza. Had the Toscana, which has mozzarella, tomato sauce, mushrooms, and sausage. The crust was burnt and flavorless and the toppings just seemed kind of bland and strangely old-tasting. I mean, not fresh. Weird, I know. I sort of liked the red sangria, but it was a somewhat odd twist on sangria, as it was pretty sweet and not very strong. I am sorry, Grazie. I am spoiled by having had the best pizza on earth in Chicago and am too excited to try the other acclaimed pizza joints in Phoenix/Scottsdale to return to your restaurant.~~#~0
As close to a real, east coast deli as you'll find west of the Appalachians. Delicious sandwiches, egg creams, etc. Pricy, but kids apparently eat free in summer, so we kept it at 5 stars.~~#~1
We searched our phones for a place to go to have some Ceviche. This restaurant received some good reviews so we drove down from NE Phoenix and were a little skeptical on the location... but our concerns were immediately set at ease once we stepped inside. What a great little place with very friendly staff! We really appreciated the cleanliness too. We ordered the shrimp ceviche, shrimp in green sauce and shrimp and broccoli in cream sauce. Everything was outstanding! Even the simple rice and beans were absolutely delicious! And the tortillas,  uh-mazin!! Danielle was wonderful and we truly enjoyed her service. We will definitely come back and bring friends next time! Between the two of us, we already texted half our friends about this place and we haven't even finished eating yet! RECOMMENDED FOR SURE!!~~#~1
!!!!!!! ***  O M G ......So GOOD  ***   !!!!!!!My family & I keep coming back to this place. We drive over 10 miles to get our fix. I think it's safe to say that we are officially hooked, and when we are jonesin for Tacos Atoyac there better not be anyone or anything standing between us and our Food!Today we all came aways lickin our chops and yummy in our Tummy. I might not brush my teeth tonight!Here's what we had:~ I had scrambled eggs with chorizo (dry), cheese, onions, potatoes, and Jalapenos. Served with side of refried black beans and spicy rice, and a little plate of grilled onions (sweet & tastey) and jalapenos.~ The little woman had a Spicy burrito:al  pastor, cheese, onions, jalapenos, mayo, avocado, ~ The kid had 5 mini carne asada tacos with cheese.~~#~1
I love the owners.  Very friendly and accomodating.  One night we had called after they had closed, and were pleasantly surprised when someone answered.  Turns out they were hosting a private party.  They agreed to take our order, which made us pretty happy.I adore their Greek fries.  Olive oil, lemon, and the perfect amount of fetta.  Been here several times for lunch, and always leave happy.  Looking forward to meeting friends here for happy hour.~~#~1
I stopped in here at 6:45am one morning and was told I was a bit early.  I'm used to coffee shops opening earlier I guess, but they were nice about it and invited me in to sit and wait. I liked their stacks of Latin American Vogue, and the artwork on the walls was nice.  They also had ice water out for you to serve yourself. I ordered my usual americano, and was pleased.  They have raw sugar you can serve yourself by the heaping spoonful out of a pretty candy dish.  That was lovely.Also, they are now the only place to carry Sweet Peas Bakery items.  My favorite thing to do was walk down to Danielle's shop downtown and pick up some coffee at Royal and some of her Rosemary Shortbread cookies.  It doesn't sound yummy, but believe me they are!  Be sure to ask for some. At the time I went, the place was obviously not crowded and I received attentive service...~~#~0
Awesome resort.  I was able to stay there to celebrate a birthday in July, and fortunately it wasn't as hot as it usually is.  I am a wimp when it comes to heat, but the resort was wonderful, even with many things being closed.  The summer is off season for this spot.  We had a great time at the spa, and lying by the pool.  Be sure to have your food and drinks served there.  It feels so luxurious.~~#~1
Goddess got it right.  This place is pretty, and it looks so promising.  Big disappointment.   There was nothing for vegetarians.  The food was mediocre at best.  I'd choose Pho Nhat over this pretty restaurant any day.  Don't judge a book by its cover.  No good.~~#~1
This is a sad excuse for a gay resort.  Sort of like a worn out version of Palm Springs.  We found the Zen Yard up on Maryland Avenue a much more agreeable experience in a better neighborhood as well.  Zen Yard is a far better value, with full breakfasts included and warm, helpful hosts as well, not to mention particularly reasonable off-season rates and hosts who are actually there for their guests.~~#~1
In times of big corporations it was nice to find such a warm and friendly coffeehouse in the valley. It is just a great place to hang out, set-up your laptop or read a book. I thoroughly enjoyed my Joltachinno, a much better version of the Starbucks frappacino which is just too sweet. We came back another day for lunch and all I can say is yum! I have never had food like this at a coffeehouse.Amazingly, for our second time there, they recongnized us! WOW!  I am glad that I have found my new hangout when I come to the valley!~~#~1
Great food and service. Normally a wait on the weekend, but what would you expect.~~#~1
best coffee in phoenix (so far). experienced and friendly baristas, a large sitting area inside, nice decorations, community conscious, promotes local art and artists, outdoor sitting area, easily accessible location from the light rail and from the portland park neighborhood. i had a short vanilla cappuccino and the thing that made it the best insofar to my search for phoenix's best espresso was definitely the milk. it was properly steamed microfoam. the shots were right on, too.the milk i've had elsewhere in phoenix doesn't compare. thumbs up to fair trade.~~#~1
this place rules, plain and simplejust wish they had a cheaper jukebox~~#~1
If you have to be some place on time, don't use them.  I called at 2pm for a 4:15 taxi to arrive.  At 4:25 they were calling me saying he was right around the corner, and gave me his location.  Estrella called a couple more times to "verify my address".  At 4:35 I called them and cancelled the cab and got a ride from my neighbor.  As we pulled out of my neighborhood, we PASSED the cab. He had taken a street that he thought was going to be a through street and got himself lost. This is a TAXI service, they should know how to get around the valley!!  Don't these people use GPS, or MAPS at least?!?!?!?  End of story, I was still late for my class that I paid 250.00 bucks for. I was not allowed in, and the money is non refundable.  So thanks Estrella wasting my time and costing me money.  WORST TAXI SERVICE EVER.~~#~1
There are certain people in your life that you should have & trust. A good mechanic is high on that list. I found out about Whitey's Auto through twitter. Many of my friends were communicating with Scott, the GM, and I started following him too. His tweets were funny, authentic and relevant- and not always about auto repair. The most important aspect of his tweets? They're immediate.At the time, I had a warranty through the dealership on my car so I didn't need to go to Whitey's for service. However, when I got into a car accident and tweeted about it, Scott responded for me to call him and he'd help me out. Although Whitey's doesn't do body work, their neighbor 1st Class Auto Body does. Scott personally walked me over there and made sure they treated me right. He had made me a lifelong customer at that point. When my boyfriend's truck kept leaking oil and he wasn't getting results at the shop he was taking it to, I took him to Whitey's and introduced him to Scott. With one check, Scott could tell that the previous shop had NOT done what they had charged my boyfriend for. Scott told him if he didn't mind the leak, he could put off the service work as it wasn't something imperative. And he didn't charge him for the assessment.Recently the belts on my car fell off, causing my a/c to go out & lights to come on my dash. My warranty was over, but I didn't even hesitate. I just turned right around and took my car to Whitey's. Replacement belts and labor (plus they checked my battery and charged it for me) cost $80 less than it would have at the dealership. The inexpensive cost, along with piece of mind that comes with dealing with a mechanic and shop you can trust, make Whitey's irreplaceable. Don't hesitate to take your vehicle there first when you need service!~~#~1
I would never have picked a museum cafe for lunch, even though it is practically in my own backyard, but with my friend's endless ravings about their Dreamcatcher Salad, I relented.  And I'm glad I did!  It's now become a staple for lunch meetings!The dining area is bright and cheerful, but the outdoor patio is truly a delight on a beautiful day!  It is serene and is surrounded by a plethora of desert plants and a lovely water feature.The menu is rather short on items, but long on freshness and flavor.  Many of the offerings lean towards Southwestern style.  I have found my favorites on the menu, in particular, the Hummus Veggie Wrap which is filled to the brim in a healthy spinach tortilla with Tepary bean hummus, tomatoes, roasted red bell pepper, grilled red onions, pepitas, smoked gouda, and romaine.  (I've tried to duplicate this wrap at home with underwhelming success!)  Each sandwich comes with the choice of salad or chips. The portions are hearty.The service is attentive, but not intrusive.An absolutely divine dine!~~#~1
Pizzeria Bianco: Before and After Cited as "the best pizza in America" in numerous on-line reviews as well as on Good Morning America and as published in, Slice of Heaven, to most pizza lovers the three to four hour wait for a table is so daunting that they push on to a more open table atmosphere for their pizza experience. But to the true pizza enthusiast, Pizzeria Bianco is as much about the experience as it is the food. This place is best known for the owner Chris Bianco, hand tossing each and every pizza pie served every Tuesday through Saturday, from 5-10 pm for nearly 15 years, of which I was one of those fortunate customers. However, early 2010 Chris was forced to retire due to illness and turn over the pizza paddle and oven duties to his protégé of 15 years, Horatio Hernandez. My decision to try Pizzeria Bianco for the first time came from a challenge I put upon myself: Find the best food in metropolitan Phoenix. After hearing about Pizzeria Bianco from a friend, I made gourmet pizza my first battle in 2009. I knew about the long lines forming an hour or more before the restaurant opened, and this beautiful fall day was no exception. I arrived 60 minutes before opening and my date went to Bar Bianco to start us off with a couple of pale ale microbrews while I held our place in line. Seeing that there were only about 20 people ahead of us, we assumed we would make the 5:00 seating with no trouble. However, just as we were holding a place for the rest of our party, so were the 20 or so people ahead of us, and when the door opened promptly at 5:00, there were now over 50 people ahead of us. Needless to say we were left waiting another hour since the restaurant seats only about 40 at a time. When we were seated at 6:00, the four of us started with the homemade mozzarella, local tomato and sweet basil starter with extra virgin olive oil drizzled all over as well as homemade crusty bread with a dish of EVOO with a touch of balsamic added. We ordered three pizzas, the Sonny Boy providing salami, marinara sauce and gaeta olives, the Wiseguy a sausage and mozzarella taste explosion and the Marinara with Prosciutto di Parma. All three pizzas were piping hot when they arrived, just crisp enough around the edges and loaded with the most amazing flavors your mouth has ever experienced. We left the restaurant without remembering the nearly 3 hour wait and were fully satisfied, eager for the next opportunity to drive to 623 Adams in Phoenix for another "slice of heaven". And so, after hearing of the departure of Chris from the kitchen, curiosity got the best of me. I had to challenge this place and find out if the changing of the guard made any difference in the wait time, the food quality or the overall experience I had truly fallen for. April 6, 2010 again I ventured down to 623 Adams in Phoenix to see if a Tuesday night or a new head chef had made any difference at all. My date and I arrived at approximately 4:00 pm, one hour before the doors would open. We found a line of about 25 people and looked at each other and said, almost in unison, "Well, the wait hasn't changed". Bob trotted off to Bar Bianco to find our pale ale, Four Peaks to help pass the time. We caught a glimpse of owner Chris Bianco and I told Bob how I would love to chat with him seeing as I was writing a comparison review, I also wanted to find out who was cooking tonight. Bob stalked Chris into Bar Bianco and asked him if he had any time, would he be willing to take a picture with me and answer a couple of questions. When Bob returned with another beer and Chris Bianco in tow, I was star struck and could barely speak. All I could muster up was, "Are you cooking tonight?" To which he replied, "No, I have Horatio at the oven. I can't cook anymore." I explained my evaluative writing topic and he assured me the experience would be the same. We took a picture and off he went, back to the bar. At 6:15pm, after 2.25 hours of complete social enjoyment we were called to our seats at the bar. We ordered the same items we had enjoyed last fall with the exception of the Marinara. The overall experience was better for me as I got to enjoy personal time with Chris. As for the meal, it was just as amazing as I remembered it from 6 months prior with Chris tossing the pie for every customer. The flavors were exactly as I remembered and the service from the staff was top notch, just like the first time. From the wait to the taste, it didn't appear that anything had changed! So what makes for the "best pizza in America" and how did Pizzeria Bianco get the tag line? Well, my opinion is flavorful ingredients, a phenomenal social experience, and an owner who lives by what he serves. To Chris Bianco and the Pizzeria Bianco staff, you haven't skipped a beat!~~#~1
OK ok ok.  I'll have to agree with some of the below reviewers that this place isn't dead-on authentic Mexican food.  That being said, I love it!  The place is huge, sporting a bakery (said many times before) with unbelievably dirt cheap pastries (not said as many times before), a little carniceria (not as good as Carniceria Sonora) and a huge dining area.  The dining area with all its painted mural glory is so goddamn cool that I find myself wanting to just hang out there for hours watching La Primera Division de Mexico on TV and enjoying a nice $2 Dos Equis.  The food - that's probably the only tougher part.  Keep in mind it's still pretty good, but there are better places in the area for getting your Mexican on food wise.  The potato taco is worth getting because it's fairly unique, but it came out so soggy that I had to eat it with a fork.  I grabbed a couple of the Yelp-Advertised taquitos as well - keep in mind these are not the Circle K, rolling taquitos.  They are literally just smaller tacos, but they were damn good.I guess when it comes down to it, I'm an atmosphere buff.  There were so many cool things to check out in this multi-plex, and the atmosphere was so warm that I'd love to head back again soon.~~#~1
Being my first review, there is only one place I've always had a 5-star experience. Hoodlum's is the ultimate music/cd/vinyl/DVD/used music store in the Valley. ZIA and Stinkweeds are a distant second in terms of selection, price and overall experience.Steve and Kristian are two of the nicest local business owners I've ever met. They know a ton about music and the local scene. They'll help you find anything you need.Tucked in the SW corner of Guadalupe and McClintock (next to Traders Joe's), this is a special place to find that CD/DVD you've been waiting to purchase. They also have a wide selection of used CD's and DVD's to are at bargin prices, be sure to check that out too!~~#~1
Truly a neighborhood bar. Didn't know anyone here, and didn't leave without catching  everyone's name. Maybe not as wide of a beverage selection as the pizzeria-turned-bar in the same lot, but definitely lots more fun. Will return.~~#~0
Great groceries and fantastic service, keep it up.~~#~1
If you really care about your health and want a sincere doctor who honestly cares about his patients and believes in his practice, then this is the doctor for you. I am a 40-year-old woman who couldn't be happier with the care I have received and how I feel after seeing Dr. E for the past year. I recommend Dr. E to all my friends and family and the ones who actually listen have been very happy with their care as well. In response to Lisa N., it is possible that you are one of the few people who is immune to Botox and similar products, which is to no fault of the doctor. I too was extremely unhappy with subsequent treatments given by another doctor only to find out that no amount of the toxin would ever be effective for me because my immune system works too well. Ironic, isn't it? You should always do your homework when looking for a new doctor, especially when you know exactly what type of treatment you are seeking. For example, if you are simply interested in the HCG diet program instead of overall health and you had been elsewhere for less money then likely that place is a better match for you. We don't live forever, but we can live better while we are here. Take control of your medical care, it's your body and therefore your decision. Dr. E at Carefree Health Path is a great place to start your empowering journey to health.~~#~1
When we first moved to Ocotillo the first thing we did was peruse yelp for the best local eateries. Mikado was one of the first things to splash onto our radar and we had to check it out. Luckily for us Mikado is literally a 2 minute drive from our house. :)The restaurant is low-key and I like how the lighting is a little dimmer than usual to create a more mellow ambience. The servers are all very attentive and kind which makes the eating experience so much more enjoyable. So anyway, on to the sushi! I adore sushi rolls with some kind of crunch in them which is why I love anything tempura. The Big Shrimp Tempura Roll is my favorite and it could stand alone as a meal because it's so ginormous. They stuff 3 large tempura shrimp in there with avocado and cucumber then drizzle it with eel sauce. LOVE! And while I'm on the subject, Mikado has mastered the art of frying up a perfect tempura. Their tempura shrimp is super crispy, isn't greasy and always fresh out of the fryer. The Crunch Roll is superb, the salad dressing is addictive and the chicken noodle udon soup is delicious. Their prices are great and you still get so much food. How can you go wrong? If you're within a 20 mile radius of Mikado you need to stop by.Also, I can't say this enough: Please support your local businesses! They depend on your patronage!~~#~1
Went with three others. My first & last visit.  The menu did not properly describe the item and instead of a bell pepper dish, I got a port dish. It was dreadful. The other three I went with were not very happy with their meals either.  The restaurant was extremely noisy. Not pleasant at all & terrible food. Will never go back.  A big disappointment.  They can't even describe their items properly so you never know what you are going to end up with. They called it a pepper dish and it was a pork dish. The sauce apparently contained pulverized peppers. Are they stupid?  I should have trusted my instincts & not the commercial.  It's a third world country. They can barely afford to feed themselves. They have no history of cuisine.  I wouldn't waste my time and money on this place again.~~#~1
Loves the recent Cezanne show. In fact I've seen it twice in the last week. I need to find out more about who curated the exhibit as it is very fine. The Oriental collection is very nice and soothing. The Downtown Chamber Group gave a wonderful concert in the great hall on Sunday. I wonderful and unusual program of saxophone and harp. I think it is great to have music in the galleries. I liked the musicians being on a platform. since the room isn't banked one can see the performers.A few things I'm not so crazy about:The great room is this awesome space for large art. Sunday I sat and looked at it for several hours. You know, not such great art. I find the Terrill boring and the other pieces uninteresting.The cafe never quite lives up to its promise. My lunch companion barley touched her lunch and the waiter never asked why or offered a box.Enough grousing I love the place and go often.~~#~1
Decided to check this place out for lunch yesterday. The decorations were very modern and I really liked the outdoor atrium you can eat in. I ordered a burger and wifey had the Hot chick sandwich. My burger was good, nothing to write home about but good. The wife enjoyed her sandwich, all though she overlooked the fact that the guacamole was spicy. I think this could be a great place to come and get some wine and appetizers, looking forward to coming back on the weekend! Late open kitchen is a bonus!~~#~0
Not only was the music the worst I have ever heard the wait staff was as annoying as ever! Like a wanna be swanky place in a strip mall that smells like fish and plays horrible music. Food was so so but over priced for what it was.~~#~1
I've always been partial to Harkins Theaters because they have the best seats.  I used to say, "You know what would be the best theater?  AMC experience, with Harkins seats.."Guess what.. AMC Westgate is the birth of the spawn of just that.  I love this place.  It's frigging massive to start with and has everything inside it.  Not to mention an IMAX.  The experience is great and the chairs are super comfortable.Nothing really more to say that it's a theater.  I do like the new Stubs card that they put out.  Yeah it sucks that you have to pay for it, but it's only $12 a  year.  Not bad for all the free stuff you get.Another cool thing about this theater is the location.  If you are going to grab dinner/lunch before hand, ther eis a ton of places to choose from.Nice work AMC on making a great theater!!Ohhh big big big heads up.  Be sure to see a movie before Noon or ya get to pay nice big money.   that's probably the draw back.  I'll still give you 5 stars.~~#~1
This place is fun for drinks. Although, I wouldn't suggest eating here... My friend and I had the grilled cheese and tomato soup. I love tomato soup - even cheap stuff in a can... but what they served us didn't even resemble soup at all! Without any exaggeration, it was literally pizza sauce. I hope it was some sort of mistake... but who does that? Puts straight pizza sauce in a bowl with a spoon? I had been drinking all night and was starving and still couldn't eat it. That being said, the staff here was great and the service was really fast.~~#~0
Once again craving sushi/Japanese food but since Iron Chef didn't met my expectations I decided to go elsewhere. Eastwind was farther away from me but I decided to try it out.There was no old fried food smell, already a plus. I can't eat raw fish yet so I usually ordered eel rolls. Also got the shrimp and veggie tempura. The Caterpillar roll was not my favorite. I hate when they fill the rolls with fake crab, plus it didn't tasted freshly prepared. The tempura on the other hand was delicious! Light batter, not oily, with 5 pieces of shrimp and several vegetables. Gyoza was pretty good too. I'll definitely drive a little farther for Eastwind.~~#~0
I attended a UYE (Unofficial Yelp Event) here and I have to say that Haus Murphy's pretty much wowed all 20 or so of us!It has taken me over a week to get to the review.  I was still reflecting on the German meatloaf, red cabbage and Weihenstephaner Hefeweizen.How do you say, "Damn that was good!" in German?  I have new found respect for German cuisine thanks to Chef Hoffman (not sure about the spelling there).The fubar of Yelpers (I am pretty sure that is the correct term for a large gathering of Yelpers) dined on the patio which is a great space.  Service was very good throughout the meal.There was quite a bit of sharing going on and although I don't remember everything I tried, it was all really good.It was great to see so many friends and meet some new Yelpers like Norm!~~#~1
Avoid this einstein's at all cost. I have been laying in bed puking for over 12 hours because I ate at this garbage dump. The reason I know it was them? My girl is laying next to me puking as well. And the only place we both ate together less than 24 hours ago was there.The incompetent staff that happens to grace this poorly operating business cannot tell the difference between a large drink and a medium and take over 10 minutes to make two identical sandwiches.After we got home and ate them, fast forward 6 hours and we are both puking our brains out.The most common reason for this to happen is when an employee does not wash their hands after getting feces on them. Then they touch my food and I get sick. Based on the staff that day, it does not surprise me one bit.I would recommend starving over going here. Never again. Now I will go speak to Ralph on the big white telephone some more.~~#~1
I LOVE love LOVE Coffee Bean.  I have been in love with Coffee Bean for years.  I am so bummed out that they are not all over the place like the "S" coffee store.  One of my favie drinks are the Pure Cholocate Ice Blended with whip cream and Green Tea Latte.  The service is always friendly, perky, and fully of sunshine.~~#~1
Really like this place, wound up there one night by accident, as my friend  and I got disgusted with the lousy service at the "other" bar in the same shopping center as Tony's.The place had a good vibe, jukebox playing, people shooting darts,  we felt totally comfortable, and found a table, to sit and catch up. Service was really good, The bartender, while waiting on another customer, made eye contact, to acknowledge me, and said she'd be right with me.  I like that in a place, ---nothing worse than standing at a bar waiting to order drinks and feeling invisiable.My beer was good and cold,  my friend ordered a vodka and orange juice, and commented that it was a nice "stiff drink" -  We both said we were glad we stumbled upon Tony's and will be back.~~#~0
Very good place to eat.. I go here atleast 3 times a week and the owners are very good people, they always interact with their customers. I pretty much know the owners and everytime I go there they already know what I want. I highly recommend this place.~~#~1
Taste buds went CRRRAAZZYYY!!Finally made it to the much raved about Pizzeria Bianco and happy I did. It was absolutely delicious. Thankfully we made it at a good time where we didn't have to wait at all for a table (YES!). I ordered the Margherita and was deliciously pleased. However, my sister opted for the Biacoverde and boooy was I jealous. It was awesome and my favorite by far.~~#~1
Dr. Ford is great.  She came highly recommended and I can see why.  Very focused and caring assessment of my Dog.  Bring your animals here, they will be taken care of properly.~~#~1
Everyone point and laugh at the nerd reviewing a convenience store.Oh yeah? Stuff it. Like donuts? Check this out.Get in your car and drive here around 3AM and try their donuts. Had every single donut place in the area, and nothing can hold a candle to the QT donuts. My guy begrudgingly takes me here every couple of weeks for the donut stake out. It's so worth it. They get hard during the day, so seriously - 3AM or bust.~~#~1
As if that could all be overlooked, the pizza isn't even good.  If you are in this part of town, go to Z Pizza or Slices for great pizza instead!~~#~1
First of all, I have to give Dos at least three stars just because it's Dos. I mean did going to Dos make me feel old, yes, were there some interesting people there and not in a good way, yes, did I spend more money than I wanted to, yes, but all in all you always have a great time. Nothin' but laughs. The giant jenga didn't suck either. Dos Gringos is a staple among the youngins, as I like to call 'em. In college, one will totally fit in, however, now'a days it's a place meant solely for people watching. And boy do you get an eye full. Drink's are cheap, tacos are good, and the bathrooms aren't as scary as you would think. Go! Have fun, get drunk.... but don't expect anything classy.~~#~0
My daughter and I really love it here.  I always walk in without an appointment and I never have to wait more than a few minutes.  The staff is very friendly, talented and professional.  Highly recommended!~~#~1
I am giving Ajo Al's on Shae five stars because I've been there regularly for about two years and it's always good. Now let me point out two issues: I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food, and I only get the Tacos Del Mar or Ono Fajitas which are versions of the same thing. The chips are fresh made and great as are the salsa and hot salsa (more peppery and hot). For appetizers the Chili Con Queso Dip and Nachos are good sized and tasty. For a friend and I this location is somewhat out of the way but we still go regularly. Try it.Detail:Like I said I'm not exactly a fan of Mexican food. I like the Americanized fast-ish food chains: Qdoba, Chipotle even Baja Fresh. I've eaten at actual Mexican restaurants in Mexico and had home cooked Mexican fish tacos and tamales. It's growing on me but these are not tastes I grew up with.I have a friend who loves Ajo Al's, she lived next to it or something. So I pretty much got dragged there about two years ago and I liked it right away. Like I said, I've only really eaten the fish tacos but they're the best I've had. The fish is good, the sides are good, idk what chipotle cream is but it's good, good service, the chip lady is nice, all the wait staff have been good.It's typically not crowded but sometimes your go there and the place is close to full. I've never waited to be seated though. I've never tried the bar area. The water seams better than tap water...a dumb observation but I usually drink water rather than soda so I mention that. They give you a pitcher of water on seating and refill if needed. The chips and salsa are endless and excellent. Service is always good.Two friends typically get the Pollo Con Queso and swear it's the best ever. I've had it as left-overs and it's good but not really my thing.This is the only Ajo Al's I've been to...no comment on the rest of this chain.~~#~1
No no no...do not go here, now I'm not talking about the fact that the place looks crappy, or the bathroom is suspect but the fact that the food is nasty. It was completely empty when we were there and that should have been some indication on what to expect but no I am a glutten for punishment. I ordered some tacos and didn't even finish the meal I ended up just tossing the food and still got a tummy ache from what little I did eat. This place is definitely not a good look~~#~1
Wow, Chill rocks. Frank and his lovely wife, the proprietors, are fantastic. The prices are super low and the gelato/sorbet is awesome. While we were there, a little kid dropped the top part of his cone on the ground. Frank replaced it for free. Then he gave us a sample of the fat-free, sugar-free chocolate sorbet, which made me want to buy a pint of it... after I had already eaten a baby sized Mango/Pomegranate mix. Yum. How about this: Go have dinner/lunch/breakfast/whatever at Pita Jungle, then walk across the parking lot to Chill for dessert. That sounds like the perfect evening.~~#~1
Ok, technically this is not Mexican food, it's spanish and puerto rican food, but has a lot of the same kinds of spices and is WAY, WAY, WAY good.first off, they have plaintains, which look like bananas, but taste like potatoes. if you've never had them, try them here, yum! this is definitely the place to go with a big group of peole and share a few different dishes. good luck, because the menu is HUGE. the dessert menu alone has two dozen items!seafood like ceviche and paella (supposed to be to die for), tapas, tamales, soup, salads, egg dishes (not breakfast),...the list goes on and on and that's just lunch!plates top off around $12 for the most expensive for lunch, but you can easily make a meal out of two apps.the mojito is their specialty, and they have i think a dozen rums to choose from, along with sangria. on the last monday of the month, every bottle of spanish wine is half off- you cork it if you don't finish it. i can't give this rest. a more glowing recommendation!~~#~1
Durants ROCKS.I love the red velvet walls.I love walking through the kitchen to get to the restaurant.I love the garlicky cheesy bread that probably has a million calories in it.I love the steaks.I love the decor.I love the bar.We all ordered different items when we went here for dinner one night, and all raved about what we had.  I don't think you can go wrong, no matter what you order.  It's amazing, delicious, and very very unique.~~#~1
I had the misfortune of stopping by this establishment today with two things, a skirt and a cloth handbag. I asked the woman at the counter if I could have some very minor stitching done on a cloth purse. She looked it over for about 3 seconds and said 'Oh no I don't see how this could be repaired'. (what I wanted sewn were two little pom poms attached to the cloth strap that were loose and I wanted them to be stitched on there tighter). Not a difficult task. She then told me that she could maybe 'send it out' and have it stitched but it would take a week or more to get it back. WHAT??!I then asked her about  the skirt which I wanted cleaned and/or pressed with the tags attached (because I'm selling it). She said no that the tags would be destroyed in the process. So I went to another dry cleaners and asked the same things for both the skirt and the bag. I was informed that what I wanted done would be no problem and that I could pick it up the next day.~~#~1
I love this place. The Las Vegas roll is amazing however the crispy California roll isn't that crispy. Their sake is in fact bomb and the restaurant it always a good time. Their prices are reasonable for sushi places in Tempe and the service has always been awesome. If you've got a party bigger than 4 though, call ahead.~~#~1
Some of the best coffee I've ever had -- and I lived in Portland. Insanely good selection & product. Tanzanian peaberry off the charts. Owner gets beans from multiple sources to ensure that his selection is the best.~~#~1
One of my most favorite coffee shops! Location for sure. Soooo cute here. Inside and out. The patio is beautiful and you feel like you're in a diff city for a moment. Coffee is pretty darn good. Not the best, but good. And the menu is great. I am a vegetarian and they have many options for us. The treats are amazing. The staff is amazing. And they always seem to play great music too. Love this place. Wish it were not so far away in Mesa...~~#~1
I had heard they were spiced just right but for me it was too salty of a burger.  It was also expensive considering a I had a burger, hot dog, fries and a shake.  Not a favorite but wouldn't mind coming again.~~#~0
Meh..not particularly memorable.I've eaten at this location and the one by ASU, though I like this location better. I would probably only eat here if I was walking by and I was starving. The cookies ROCK though, I like that you get one with your sandwich. And they have my favorite flavor of Jones Soda (Sugar-free Black Cherry) which kicked ass. Warning: The roast beef sandwich (Overture?) comes with horseradish sauce and it is hot as a mother.  I like the spice but it was almost unbearable. My nose pretty much turned into a snotty waterfall. Go to Opa Grill next door instead.~~#~0
Now that this place is under new management it's gotten better.  i went once before and it was kind of nasty, now it's cleaner and has a better selection.Its hard to find  edible chinese food in Phoenix, this one is one of the better ones now.  I think it's renamed Fuji Buffet.  It even had a sushi bar (not a sushi eater, but it had one) and everything was as fresh as can be expected. Large shrimp and chicken selection, and pizza and things for the kiddos.Stay away from the desserts tho', not so great.~~#~0
I love this restaurant. Very cheap, very clean, the food is sooo good. My mom and I eat there once every couple of weeks, sometimes twice once a week. The staff is very friendly and attentive. The environment is very comforting. I recommend this place to anyone who loves cheap but tasty Mexican food.~~#~1
I'm giving this Office Max five stars for convenience, friendly service, competitively priced products a stocked shelves. This Office Max is a great in and out shop. On one side there is the detailed supply store and on the office side, there is a complete copy center. It's open until 9 on the weekdays and they don't make you feel rushed if you get there at oh let's say...8:50. In fact, they are helpful! They walked me around and helped me find the random items I needed. The copy center staff was also very friendly. This Office Max has your complete supply of office items but their prices are very reasonable! I purchased the same item at another shop that I did here and it was significantly less expensive here. So on that note, I end my review on Office Max but I will report back with any new findings.~~#~1
Tasty Thai- is. But it could also be called Delicious Thai. And the service is always great!~~#~1
I'm so glad this corner has been revived again--though I never got to try Willo House. The biggest plus for me is that this place is only like a 7-minute walk from my work. I met a friend here for lunch a couple weeks back. I had their walnut chicken salad. The portion was pretty good for the $8. But the chicken had a tuna-texture I wasn't expecting. But the greens tasted fresh and there was just enough dressing for my preference. I haven't tried anything else beyond a chai latte which was pretty standard. Some of their pastries look good but I wonder if the muffins are from Costco. I give this place one star for atmosphere. Each seating area is decorated a little differently. Love the stain glass and the blown-up photos of spots around Phoenix as table decorations. This place really does feel local and one of a kind.~~#~0
If this place only served chips and their salsa bar, I would still give it 5 stars!  As a salsa and hot sauce (they're different, people!) fanatic, I tend to judge Mexican food joints based on their quality of salsa - and La Condesa ranks high!  Last time I was there, I counted 10 different salsas and 2 or 3 different condiments (limes, onions, etc.).  They offer a wide range of salsas from their exotic strawberry salsa, to spicy chipotle, or creamy cilantro.  It looks a little silly with 8 little cups on salsa at your table, but you have to try them all! The horchata here is also 5-star material.  Don't be a cheapskate - shell out the $4 for it! Its giant, it will make you happy. And, when you're done with it you can eat the fruit and nuts - the drink keeps on giving! I have been here twice and have only eaten the veggie tacos, 2 of them are enough to fill me up and they are very delicious!  I must say I am not a huge fan of their rice and beans, which seem a bit bland to me.  But, the tacos, salsa and drinks all make up for some plain 'ol rice! I was very  happy to see a decent sized crowd here on my most recent visit and that La Condesa is applying for a liquor license.  This place needs to stick around for awhile!~~#~1
Tarbell's is top notch in all areas!  Food quality, service, ambience, amazing!  I recently took ten business associates there for a meeting, and I got nothing but compliments the next day on such an excellent choice of restaurant!  Definitely try the Spaghetti & Meatballs as well as the Mac N Cheese, and even the Pizzas are to die for.  And the burger too!  You really cant go wrong here.  Warning the deserts here are HUGE (yet amazing).  One desert is enough for 2-3 people!~~#~1
Amazing cheesesteak.One mile from my home is Corleone's. About 15-20 minutes from my home is Capriotti's. I never go to Corleone's. I go to Capriotti's all the time.The workers here are nice and the cheesesteak is terrific. The large is 20" I believe, so if you're ordering for yourself and in no mood to eat until you have a stroke, get the medium. Also, try it with the hot peppers. It adds the slightest bit of spice without becoming too overwhelming.That's really all I can say about this place. Wonderful cheesesteak. I haven't tried anything else because the cheesesteak is too good to pass up when I make the drive down there. The patrons rave about the other sandwiches, though, so I absolutely would not be afraid to try something else. There's maybe 5 or 6 tables inside and 2 outside? so be prepared to order to go if you arrive at prime dine-in lunch/dinner hours.Do yourself a favor and go to Capriotti's. Help this place attain the reviews and ratings it deserves. The fact that there's only 8 reviews is criminal. I understand it is in the heart of the suburbs, but it's worth the drive.~~#~1
I have been exploring more of the park recently.  I want to add that the National Trail (which is almost 15 miles long and goes from one end to the other) is a real gem.  The views on this trail are outstanding, and on the western half, you will find far fewer people than on the eastern half.  Highly recommended.~~#~1
Decent food at not unreasonable prices. The service is good. What is up with the hyper aggressive pigeons on the patio? The waitresses actually pass out squirt guns to the the customers to fend off the ever persistent waves of the foul fowl. At the end of your patio experience there is a certain sense of camaraderie shared with the other patrons.~~#~0
Been going to Pita since they were a take out only in Tempe. Fast forward 15 + years. They are getting too big for their britches. They started franchising, hired some corporate goons and that is where it started to fall off. The chicken has always been great but is faltering. There was never any better hummus on on the planet until they added all the red oil? Be very careful of seafood. I love the seafood dishes here, absolutely fantastic, but they have made me ill on more than one occasion. I was even hospitalized  once from the shell fish. I have some good friends that are still managers so I go back occasionally to see them. They are not as thrilled either. Too bad. All good things come to an end. This was the best unknown gem in Arizona for years.UPDATE. No more red oil! Pretty solid but not what it used to be. Lentil salad still kicks butt.~~#~0
I have been going to Physical Therapy for several weeks working on Plantar Faciatis (ripped tendons in the foot), I was not getting enough massage to make much progress, I switched to Massage N You and they focused on my calves and now we are making good progress on healing.  They had the right touch, pressure and listened to what I needed.   Going back for more...~~#~1
FEZ... The two times that I went it was in the afternoon on the weekend. Both times, I was able to enjoy a great lunch with my sister and cousin and then again with my sister. The two dishes I liked were the FEZ burger and the Casa Blanca Chicken.  The berry shortcake was good, however the water from the strawberries sort of killed the whipped cream and the shortcake (biscuit) was very good.Overall the environment during those times were peaceful and quiet. The staff offered advice on the menus. The price a little high for my wallet but I would definitely come back to splurge with great company in tow.~~#~0
Recently bought a house and had issues with the speed and interference with the very many wifi networks around me.I decided to go wired so after I did a lot of research on how to get a wire from my second floor to first floor for the entertainment center. I bought a lot of tools from Fry's electronics and then after I started actually looking at what I had to do, I realized it would not be something I can do myself.I called good guys electric and they came over and ran a couple of wires using CAT6 instead of the CAT5 I would have used through the (nail-ridden) attic and through walls without any wires sticking out while they kept away from the electrical wires to prevent interference.I returned the tools and wire I got from Fry's electronics and that made the install very affordable.I'm very happy with the quality of my network speed now, being able to stream HD content from my server upstairs to the TV 200 feet away.After completing the network-wiring job, I had them install a new chandelier on a remote-controlled dimmer switch which was done quickly and works great~~#~1
Been here twice. First time to fix a broken window regulator and the second time to get a checkup. All the techs have been extremely honest and I've never felt taken advantage of. I spent over a grand on updates to my car there and I could've spent more but again, they're honest and didn't pressure me to do everything that they said. It's family owned & run (they're originally from the bay area so of course I've got a soft spot!) If you have car problems, need a check up, or need a second opinion, they won't steer you wrong (pun intended).~~#~1
So following the previously reviewed experience I received a phone call from the Dr. who was very intent on making the situation right. He did all the right things to make sure that we were certain that he appreciated our business and was very apologetic about the unacceptable wait the day before. This is precisely how any business should react to a bad customer experience. The subsequent visit to complete the wisdom teeth extraction consult was very expedient as was our visit on the day of the surgery. In short, the office resolved our very unsatisfactory experience in a very impressive manner.~~#~0
The food was good - nothing extra special.  I like that you get guacamole with your meal and that they have lingua on the menu.  I will have to go back and try it.  The things I did not like were they sat our group of 10 right by the server station.  It's awkward to overhear their conversations.  The service seemed a bit lackluster.  It was almost as if they were not intrested in a big group coming in.  Our server was pretty good, but not overly friendly.  I will definately try this place again and update.~~#~0
This is like a little sanctuary on the West Side with a few amazing therapists. The LMTs are pretty different from each other so ask some questions before you book. It is so awesome to walk in and be addressed by name and with a smile. The owner is seriously the nicest lady I've seen running a business in a long time.~~#~1
Japanese chefs, top notch sashimi, affordable neighborhood sushi place! 5/5I'd lived in Japan before and this place can beat those in Tokyo! If you go to Hiro, you have to order their sashimi. We always order scallops sashimi, yellow tail, salmon, toro sashimi and uni (sea urchin)! Their rolls are amazing too. All sashimi comes in a big-fat-lap portion! Very fresh! The service is great too.~~#~1
I couldn't wait to get home and yelp this place. Five stars, too! After a (raw chicken) bad experience some 13 years ago, I hadn't been to Bandera until tonight. WOW! It was a GREAT experience!!! We started off with a grilled artichoke which was fabulous! Both of us had the Texas Hill Country Ribs which came with cole slaw (not your ordinary cole slaw) and the most delish matchstick fries. Unfortunately, I don't eat seeds and nuts (peanuts in the cole slaw...my husband loved it) but the very polite and wonderful server, Sarah, offered some other sides and I picked the braised red cabbage, which came with a little goat cheese on the top which was to die-for delish!! Home made wonderful braised red cabbage! The entire meal was SUPERB! The service was phenomenal, and we were lucky enough to sit by the kitchen and see all of the dishes come out...they all looked YUMMY! I am so happy that my neighbor suggested Bandera's ribs, and will go back frequently as you can tell this place is run as a tight ship. Everyone is polished, polite and efficient! The food is an experience in perfection, and the service tip top!Next time, I'll take some pictures (if I'm not too hungry)... I don't think it's a shorts and jeans type of place but a dressy/casual type of place, if you know what I mean...REALLY EXCELLENT FOOD!~~#~1
Located in the space formerly occupied by LGO's short lived Radio Milano, the north side of Campbell has been reincarnated as the Arcadia Room, a private dining facility operated by the aforementioned restaurant group.I dined here recently for the hubby's work dinner. Unlike so many private facilites that feel like a corporate conference room, the Arcadia Room is a cool, casual, restaurant - all to your self.We had about 60 in our group, and had plenty of room to mingle at the sleek bar lining one side of the room, or gather by the open kitchen.The weather was blazing hot when we were there, but there is even a lovely little patio outdoors for guests.I think this would be an ideal location for any work or social occasion where you want an intimate atmosphere combined with reputable fare.~~#~1
I love Tasty Kabob!  Their food is always excellent, and I try to make it back there whenever I return to the Valley.  I always order their chicken shish kabob entree, which comes in a generous portion that includes rice and grilled vegetables.  The chicken is always tender, well-marinated, and equally well-seasoned.  Their beef shish kabob entree is also very good. Try shaking a little sumac spice onto the rice and meat for some extra flavor, or just enjoy it as is.  It's difficult to choose from their list of appetizers and side dishes, but their hummus is always creamy and smooth, and I love their shirazi salad.  Their spicy beans dish, however, is, by far, my personal favorite, and I always make sure to order it.  Just as important as the food is the friendly service I encounter whenever I visit.  The couple who own the restaurant always make you feel welcome.  Good food and service that makes you feel at home, what more can you ask for?  Simply put, Tasty Kabob is one of the best.~~#~1
Dave's has a good BBQ sauce and reminds me very much of KC style BBQ and side's.  I have eaten here a few times and found that the portion sizes are immense!  Service has always been efficient and no reason to complain about anything.  I think this BBQ place would be the best option for a large group.Is this the best BBQ in the world?  No, but I sure wouldn't turn it down!Enjoy!~~#~0
I have been wanting to eat here since it opened and finally got the opportunity.  The ambiance and service is excellent, however that was not the reason why I was there.  I was there for the food that a lot of people have been raving about.I read somewhere that the hanger steak was their specialty and I don't disagree.  I had a taste and it was indeed very tasty.  And if I go back I will definitely get it.  And at under $20 it is a steal.  However, I ordered the 8oz filet for myself.  It was cooked properly and tasted good but not memorable.  The individual sauces that you can order on the side were also nothing special.  And yes, the fries were just as everyone on Yelp said they were; good but just like In-n-Out's, but cooked a bit longer.  The sides dishes were ok at best and were a bit on the smaller side.  However, the potato gratin was amazing and better than I have had at any steak place thus far.While it is less expensive than Mastros/City Hall, I think that for a few extra dollars it is worth going to a better place.  In my opinion, Mastros/City Hall have much better steaks and better/bigger side dishes.  However, J & G does have a better ambiance.~~#~0
Dim lighting. Fleet Foxes. Beautiful upstairs seating that almost seems secret. Band of Horses. Benches that are less cushy than you anticipate them to be. The Shins. Black board specials, just because they look cool. Beirut. $13 vegetable dishes. Intimidated yet? Fight through the angst. Once you take your first bite of food, all the hullabaloo will be well worth it.Order the forbidden rice bowl. Tell them to make it vegan (the vegetables are usually cooked in a bit of butter)... after all, you're a pseudo-hipster for the evening, and it's fantastic. If you're depressed by the idea of black rice as your main carbohydrate, the flat breads are taste-gasmic. That crust... the things I'd do for unlimited amounts of that flat bread crust. Top it off with figs and ricotta, and there's no way I'm passing up a square or two... or seven. If you're still not sold on the idea of carb-loading, the salmon "superfood" is delicious and nutritious, and who's not into a little super(food)iority now and then?But on to the main event... the chocolate stout cake + spiced ice cream + espresso ganache was the best chocolate cake I've ever had. It was just so damn... moist. There, I said it. Moist. Moist. Moist. Ew. But really, yum. If caffeine, chocolate and alcohol don't suit your fancy (wimp), the cheesecake in a jar was equally delightful. Cookie crust + strawberry compote + cream + cheesecake. Layered. In a jar. Who thought of that? Someone with adorable thoughts, that's who. And let's be honest, you've earned dessert. I mean... you ordered a healthy, vegan entree over the french onion cheeseburger, right? Right. Of course you did.~~#~1
Went here to meet up with LA friends during Superbowl weekend. The decor is pretty unique here and the bathrooms are quite the trip. Bartenders are ace, cocktail waitresses are good looking, and the music is a healthy mix of bangers and decent indie hits. Tip for the door guys there don't let in 6 dudes at a time, even if they are Persian dudes with tons of cash who want to buy bottles. Boo!~~#~0
Yes, it is a biker bar.  And it is packed with them at certain times, especially weekends.  I don't ride. But if you roll in on a weekday around noon you might not see any, and if everyone seems to know everyone it's because they are all friendly local folks. So if you're visiting Cave Creek don't assume the Hells Angels are there looking to kick ass   Most of the "bikers" probably drive BMWs during the week.  I stop in at least once a week for a bite.  The food is the best bar food in Cave Creek and the service is awesome. I've been to every bar in town. Harold's , The Chip, Toad, etc. all are good, but The Hideaway is the best.~~#~1
Tried a couple Tammie Coe cupcakes and a mini muffin two weeks ago... Unfortunately for them, I also sampled Ollie Cakes... No wonder Ollie Cakes, aka Urban Cookie, won Cupcake Wars and Tammie Coe sits in high rent selling pretty sugar disguised as a cupcake.Drive a few miles north, get whatever the special cupcake of the day is along with a Brown Velvet and Lemon, and save saying you enjoyed Tammie Coe for impressing snooty folk who wouldn't know yummy if it bit them on the butt!Really, the TC cakes were just cakes... No flavor, no texture, dry... And I can't say how impressed I was that the clerk shoved all my selections into one, tiny, flat bag meant for cookies or sandwiches!  Apparently presentation and flavor preservation mean nothing... As their products now do, at least to me.~~#~1
Just because this place is called "Maria Maria" doesn't mean they sell Mexican food. Their menu actually says "Mexican inspired cuisine" which should have been my clue to leave. The food is border line Nasty!  The restaurant is cute and sort of romantic but it's so loud in there that it ruins the "romantic" mood. I was excited to see they had live music until they started playing some weird pop music. Why would they do that in a "Mexican" restaurant?  I wanted to leave but our waitress was no where to be found 20minutes after we finished our meal.I don't recommend this place for any meal!  I have only been living in Scottsdale for two months but it seem that Arizona is "Cougar" town. The bar was full of them. I'm beyond annoyed with all this ladies acting like they are 21 wherever I go. I'm embarrassed for them. They dress and act young but with that face and hands who are they kidding besides themselves? gee.~~#~1
I work right across the street and a few of us went here for lunch one afternoon. I ordered a salad to go. As soon as I saw the guy grab shredded sandwich lettuce to make my salad I almost told him to stop but I didn't. I regreted it when I started to dig in and realized the lettuce was brown and yellow. Very disappointed. $6+ bucks for nasty lettuce tomatoes and green peppers. I ordered a salad thinking I was getting something like the picture on their website. I won't be returning here. I'll be passing on lunch next time the co-workers opt for this place.~~#~1
R.T. O'Sullivan's really hit the spot! The service and the atmosphere were outstanding. We were put into the back room which was perfect for our large group of 45 plus. The server kept track of everything even as people moved around and socialized. The food was wonderful. We will be going back!~~#~1
Tilted Kilt is alright. I have been here a few times and what stands out in my mind is nice decor with many tvs, good beer selection, but crappy service and food. I am really big on service, coming from the industry for over 7 years, so when I get bad service, I get in a bad mood. The girls are pretty lucky they are hot because I don't think it would fly otherwise. The fish n chips I had were not good, obviously just poured from a bag, which is disappointing. I felt the server was really flaky and inattentive, she was sitting with a group of guys pretty much the whole time, while I was waiting for my napkins, then my malt vinegar, ugh. Then she came to tell us she was going on a smoke break and I don't think I saw her after that. All in all, I can appreciate a cute girl in sexy kilts (I was actually hired to work here when they first opened) and I love me some good beers and flat screens, but I will pass on the whole dining experience.~~#~0
Bizarre location with good food. Don't expect an "environment". It's poorly decorated but looks as if there is a rockin karaoke setup there. Still, I liked it.~~#~0
Good fish fry place. I've also had there Monster Burger- delish.~~#~0
I have been going to Nails 101 for a long time, and I love them! I had a manicure done there about a month ago, and it lasted for 8 days without chipping! Love Nails 101!!!!!!!!~~#~1
I love Fuddruckers because I can put my own toppings on including gooey, melty fake cheese!  Also, they have frings (a combo of fries and onion rings).  Very tasty.~~#~1
The food is fantastic, the staff is helpful and the atmosphere is comfortable. The food at El Bravo just tastes better than the food at any other Mexican restaurant I have been to in Phoenix, regardless of price. The cheese is amazing! I love their flour tortilla flautas , crispy beef tacos, cheese crisps, enchiladas (I could go on and on). I really can see no reason to go anywhere else in Phoenix for Mexican food. I highly recommend El Bravo.~~#~1
EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE! Even with Happy Hour in full swing and the place full of parched Winkies, the service at our large table was spot on. We barely had time to settle our bums and push the silver out to claim our table territory before iced H20 was before us, our drink orders were taken . . . and one quick blink of the eye and the "peacemakers" were before us!  Now that's what I call HAPPY HOUR!Bravo Thirsty Lion!~~#~1
What.  The.   Heck. ??    Be prepared for sticker shock!  I walked in, through the store, and made a hasty straight line back to exit.  And over and across the road to Crate & Barrel  - Ahhhhhh - much better!  Whew!~~#~1
This review has been waiting and waiting for me to get it out there, so here goes...Baiz market reminds me of Chicago. There are so many great Middle Eastern markets back there that I felt spoiled when I came to Phoenix and didn't know of many. If you think of Lee Lee as the goto spot for all of your Asian cooking needs, then Baiz is the place to go to for all of your Middle Eastern cooking needs. And, with Al Hana (check out my review for that too) right inside to satiate your hunger, Baiz is numero uno in my book! This place is fantastic, the food is fantastic, the prices are fantastic and being able to grab all the ingredients I need to make homemade baba ganoush while snacking on an amazing kufta sandwich, is pretty okay too! =)~~#~1
I recently stayed at the Sheraton for two nights while attending a conference in Phoenix. I was blown away by the services. This is by far the best service I have received while staying at a hotel in recent years. I received a room on the 15 floor. Room was what you expect from Sheraton. The view from the room really sucked!! I got the room with a view of the hotel satellite and communications towers. TV quality was good and room had Starbucks coffee. Room also came with a refrigerator. I would like to see Sheraton move to Nespresso machines. After a long day attending a conference was great to relax at the hotel lobby bar. The desserts are yummy. I didn't get a chance to try the restaurants in the hotel. Hooters and Starbucks are directly across the street. My work colleague used the gym. He said the pool was really nice and gym had everything you need. Next time!!! I would definitely stay here again!!~~#~1
This place is still open, but the name has been changed to Juba, and it is under new ownership. Same spot though, and the food has pretty much stayed the same besides a few changes in the menu. Anyway, I absolutely love coming here. My friend, Molly, is one of the servers, and I love her for introducing me to Ethiopian cuisine. It's definitely a very interesting blend of flavors, but now I come here about once or twice a week and stuff my face. I recommend trying both the vegan combo and the pita sandwich with chicken or falafel. The coffee drinks are delicious too and since they're made with Ethiopian coffee, the taste is very unique. If you've been hesitant about trying Ethiopian food, just get over it and go try the food at Juba. You won't be disappointed!~~#~1
I want to preface this review by saying that I'm close friends with one of the sushi chef's in training, so we got a seat right at the sushi bar and really had a great opportunity to chat.  That being said, I will review this strictly on the quality of food, since we received some deep discounts due to being VIP guests.  (C'mon now, you know you all get discounts too when you personally know the staff/chefs, so quit your whinin'!)The quality of the fish was excellent... some of the best sushi I've had in my existence.  The key to getting good sushi is to trust in the chef, and ask them what is fresh, and what they would suggest (omakase style).  We had a sashimi appetizer platter to start which featured blue fin, yellow tail, o-toro (yes, the good stuff!), and a few other pieces.  Served with fresh wasabi root (not the hydrated green powdery stuff), this appetizer really woke our stomachs and senses.We had a few different rolls per the chef's suggestion, and all were spectacular (including some off the menu rolls).  The kim bap roll was highly recommended, and the quality was definitely memorable, better than most Korean-mom kim bop rolls I've had in my life.We asked for ama-ebi (sweet shrimp), which was soft, tender, and sweet, with perfectly fried shrimp head to back.  This was the first time I've had such perfectly made ama-ebi, and it's made me want to continue my search in Chicago.Some tasty mochi desserts, a few bottle of sake, and all in all, it was a very enjoyable night for my compadres and I.  I'm sorry for those that have found a bad experience at Otaku, as it sounds like most of it is waitstaff issues... but as a sushi fanatic, my advice to you is this:1.  Don't ask for a table if you're party is smaller than 4... ask for a spot at the sushi counter, because that's how sushi is meant to be served.  Getting to know your chef, the chef getting to know you, having drinks together, etc.  2.  Ask the chef what he/she recommends.  Not all fish are equally fresh, and the chef will know what's best for the day.  And if you can provide them with your own past experience of what you liked/didn't like, they'll likely craft a sushi experience for you that you'll love.Verdict:  If only Otaku were in Chicago... I might go broke.  Delicious sushi, and worth a visit!~~#~1
Rental car review.118 degrees.  Standing outside in the heat waiting for a bus.  10 minutes go by and I have seen 3 busses leave with out of service signs.  Another 10 minutes pass and no active duty busses.  Finally, a bus!  We have a packed bus and the driver is just standing outside.  5 minutes later he comes back on the bus and we drive 10 miles an hour the whole way to the terminal.PHX...pay attention.  Business travelers do not appreciate being left in the heat for 20 minutes watching out of service busses pass by.~~#~1
Okay.....so....I have this thing about going out in Scottsdale in the first place because I'm always like "that one natural haired black girl" in a sea of blonde, tan, slim chicas! But that's neither here nor there. The Lodge was OKAY in my opinion. For it to be in Scottsdale where everything is super expensive for no reason the drinks are pretty cheap. I had a couple of shots and a drink and spent under $20. The bartender was SUPER sweet and she knew my name by the time I came back for my 3rd drink. They have AH-MAZING food deals. Like, get a burger and a beer for $6. Of course it's not a top notch beer but.....who doesn't love burgers and beers??There is music...coming from somewhere and it's always pretty legit, a good mix. There is like an intimate, cabin sort of corner with flickering romance lights when you first walk in if you want privacy but we usually go outside to the deck and people watch and/or play cornhole....Either way, I wouldn't say this is my favorite place ever...but I dont hate it either. Plus there is always a line of cabs outside waiting if you are too schwasted to get home :)!~~#~0
Every time I've been there they have messed up my order in some way. The first time I ordered a sonic blast w Carmel. They charged me for Carmel but there was none in it plus the bottom of the cup was busted and my ice cream was leaking out. The next I went I ordered a reese sonic blast and a snickers, they were both snickers. Very upset I haven't been back and I love that place.~~#~1
Stayed here one night while traveling to Phoenix for business.  What a cool hotel!  I've never stayed anywhere like this.I didn't experience the 50's personally, but this place has really kept and captured that essence.  (And yes, it's been renovated.  This place was built in the 50's but it's not run down or anything like that.)The room was nice, the pool looked great (never got to go...), the service was impeccable, the food at Zuzu was very good.  Old town Scottsdale is right around the corner, with great restaurants and bars.  What's not to like?~~#~1
Pomeroy's and I have a really ass backwards relationship. Typically, the purpose a bar serves me is to quench a thirst brought on by numerous factors, the most typical one being the uncanny excitement I have for making poor (but fun) decisions. Because of this, the purpose I serve bars is not only the obviously fiscal nature of the relationship, but I often serve as the harbinger of good times.So here's the problem with P-roy's.I never want to come here. Ever. This is the place I END UP at and it's typically the result of somebody else's negative circumstance that I don't really want to deal with (friend meltdown, death, crashed vehicles), and I almost always have to leave a place I like to come here. I know, weird, right? But I've been here more times than I can shake a stick at, and while I am usually the omen of good times to come, I always know that if I am on my way to Pomeroy's, not only will I be saving copious amounts of cashola, I also always end up having a blast and not doing something stupid. So the role reversal always sends me for a loop, and the bathroom always smells like fresh poop, but I can't help kinda liking it.~~#~0
Some family were in town and are Blackhawks fanatics desperate to watch the game.  This was the only place in the east valley that we could find had the NHL Center Ice package (though the girl who answered the phone had to ask somebody else ("What's NHL?")).  Not only were they kind enough to put the game on, they put it on a flat screen in the corner of the patio and we were able to have the sound on.  He shoots, he scores!  The shepherds pie was good, the beer was cold, and the waitress was very attentive.I'll stick with CK's or the Baseline Pub for the NFL games though.  While RT's had plenty of TV's, most of them were small old tube TV's.  My uncle asked why they weren't showing the score of a basketball game, and I told him it's just being cut off by the old TV's screen~~#~0
I took my family here using a groupon and it was just ok.  We tried to go on Monday however we arrived at 4:30 and the employee working the counter informed us that league play was going to begin at 5:30 so our hour would be cut short.  I was a little irritated with her "um, yeah sorrry" but whatever.  We opted to come back the next day to get our full hour.  When we arrived we were greeted by a very friendly gentlemen who provided us our shows and assigned our lane.  We were one of 3 groups in the alley and they placed us side by side instead of giving us a little space.  My wife asked for a glass of water that never came.  So the bowling was fun.  The service was marginal at best.  The lane assignment was awful.  Since we only paid $15 for 4 people for the hour including shoe rental I will go back again for the same deal.  I would never go there paying full price which is outrageous.~~#~0
I have been to Butters on numerous occasions - the latest being with three senior golfing friends from out of town.  Over the last few years, we have tried numerous breakfast places on their trips, searching for a breakfast that would satisfy all of their different tastes.  After trying six or seven different places, I brought them to Butters, since it was on our way to the golf course. We all ordered something different, including a skillet, bacon and eggs, pancakes, and an omelette.  The service was fast, and friendly. In fact, we have one picky eater, who always sends his bacon back, because it isn't as crisp as he demands.  The waitress handled his grumbling very nicely, and even had him laughing about it.The atmosphere is somewhat trendier than Butterfields, which was a very big plus for my senior friends.  They also commented on the friendly service, and the reasonable prices. It didn't surprise me that when it came time for breakfast on the final three days they were here, they all voted to come to Butters for breakfast.It should be noted that we came on the weekdays when it isn't as busy on the weekends. I have been in the area on weekends, and it always appears that there is a waiting line.The only thing keeping it from more stars, are the hash browns.  They are obviously prepackaged (or at least taste that way) - and a real breakfast place should have signature hash browns.  But all in all, a nice addition to the area.~~#~0
Fast and a drive thru. What more is there?~~#~0
This place is so great! I am a nanny and had to bring in a dance outfit to get the straps shorten for the girl I care for. The woman did this for no charge! It was only the second time I went there. She said it would only take her two minutes so no charge. She was super sweet!~~#~1
Waste of time. I could not even get in there today because there was a football game. The wanted me to pay $10 just to park. How stupid is that! 2 days before Christmas. I noticed all the prices were the same and somtimes more than any other mall. Goobye and good riddens. I have better things to do with my time and money.~~#~1
How can you go wrong with tortillas and pastries in one location?  I honestly don't understand how this little Mexican bakery stays in business  given everything is practically free. My hubby and I bought two empanadas for me (like a little pie or turnover), flan for him, a dozen tortillas, and 2 red burritos.  I guess you need to get there early because they were out of red tamales at 2 pm on a Friday.  The empanadas were baked just to golden brown and the crust was so flaky and delicious words cannot describe it.  I had lemon and cherry, but I wanted to try one of everything.  The red chili in the burritos was mild but very flavorful.  Luckily they are wrapped in foil because I couldn't wait to get home to devour mine.  They could double their prices and I would still come back!I forgot to mention the bakery is spotless, so clean I would eat off the floor if I had to.~~#~1
Exactly what a hole in the wall Pho place should be like! Totally reminds me of LA, SF or any authentic Pho place in any multi-cultural city. Congrats Phoenix for not being completely white bred and redneck- must give thanks to center city.Anyhow, portions are large, ingredients taste fresh and prices are inexpensive. If you're one of the sheltered folk out here that gets freaked out by rude bums or the lack of decor- stay in the shelter of your HOA tract home or go to the mall.~~#~1
I have never written a negative review but unfortunately I think this place needs to get it together. It is in a location that never seems to be successful. I drug my husband over excited to try it and hoping to see an improvement. No such luck. No vegetarian entree, not really kid friendsly, small portions, pricey. Not what we were looking for in an evening. Love to support new restaurants but wont be back. Hope they figure it out and make it work.~~#~0
Love, love, LOVE this place!  Eugenia is a genius!  Macarons = amazing.  Croissants = soft, buttery, flaky, delicious goodness.  Iced mocha is one of the best I have ever had.  My only complaint is that this place is not closer to my house or work, but that's probably a good thing because I would weigh 1000 lbs if it was.~~#~1
F724 She didn't even look at me, didn't bother asking why I was entering her place of business, didn't reply when I spoke and in no way acknowledged that I was even in her presence. Just handed me a ticket and was done with me. If this happened anywhere else, I would make an effort to never return, tell all my friends how horrible this experience was, and write a scathing review about the deplorable customer service of this business. Sadly, this was my Saturday morning at the DMV, a place I think is modeled after the agonizing depths of Hell. With the same musac score playing...and the same voracious stench in the air..and the same spastic children running around (only in my version of Hell, it's politicians campaigning around me). So, I was already running late because I had to complete my emissions test early. Those nice people there not only told me there were only three DMVs open on Saturdays, they gave me a map. How precious. I was fortunate enough to be near one of the only DMVs open on Saturday (Seriously? Three DMVs open on Saturday for the entire Valley?) After receiving such a magnificent welcome, I knew this was quickly going to be among the most painful experiences of my life. To simplify what was so bad, let me make a list of what I feel constitutes acceptable behavior in public: 1) Bathe. The combination of water and soap, along with massaging the skin, creates an outcome that is most pleasing. Be sure to scrub behind your ears and reference this website about another notorious spot : http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/htf/755891987.html 2) Sit still. Yes, I know we're all waiting here for about an hour. But tapping your foot, rocking back and forth in your chair or bouncing your leg aren't going to make time go any faster. Trust me, I was watching the clock. If you feel anxious, get up and walk around. 3) Leash your children. If they cannot sit quietly, leave them in the car. It's winter, they'll be fine. It's not cute when your little monster is running up and down the aisles with his honey bun squeezing out between his fingers. It's even more not cute when he fake-falls five times in a row right in front of me. 4) Maintain quiet tones and ensure appropriate conversations when taking/making calls. To the lady behind me, I'm sorry you're not that experienced in stripping. The first thought that popped into my mind was you had a failed audition for Le Girl. Thanks to your continued conversation, I was able to figure out you were a woodworker. 5) Acknowledge the humans around you. Yeah, I get it. I'm not that big. In fact, if I turn sideways I disappear. But, I'm still right in front of you so pay attention, quit bumping in to me and hitting my leg. Unless that was flirting, in which case you really need to find someone more your level. Oh, the DMV: You have a brilliant recipe for dashing dreams and gutting humanity. And you manage to do it in a painfully lit room that reeks of a combination of my brother's old gym shoes and my dad's dirty underwear. There has to be an award for that, but I don't have the motivation to research it. Oh, and F724 was my number upon entering. I spent and hour and 15 minutes looking at that slip of paper. Just so you know, that one star is for the website (which should probably get 3-4 stars but anchors like this oft sink the ship).  Le sigh... Open T-Sa 8:00am - 5:00pm; information only after 4:30pm~~#~1
I am a bonafide book junkie. Libraries are my mecca. But, I'm picky. Getting a SPL card was a cinch. I only needed one proof of residence, although I brought the recommended three, including a Netflix envelope. Once I had my card, I was ready to explore. I headed first to the public computers that help you locate books... yes! With scraps of papers and mini-pencils handy, I was good to go, once I had selected a couple books to hunt down. So far, so good.But then the library got tricky. Running out of the alphabet before I had found my book. Turning into another section - from Fiction to Large Print. WTF? I decided to turn this hunt into more of a tour, so I wandered the aisles, studied the names of sections and eventually re-acquainted myself with the library system. Don't get me wrong. This isn't rocket science. It's also not pop rocks. Having found my books and a couple DVDs, I proceeded to check out. Super easy, too. I can renew online? Bonus!My first trip to the library was GREAT. Then the second one came. The library had NONE of the books I came looking for, and I was prepared to find AT LEAST ONE of the books on my list of 5. Nope. So I put some "on hold" for me and wandered about, very disappointed. That's when I began to dislike this library. None of my books? Really? This library isn't browsing-friendly like others I have seen. Even the ol' library in Stillwater, Oklahoma was more comfortable than this one. In fact, I miss that ol' library, with its shelves of poetry, psychology, magazines and literature... so easy to find, so easy to browse, so easy to sit for hours and read. I couldn't leave SPL fast enough. On my way out, a man working (volunteering?) there showed me how to use the self-service check-out system. Nice! He was a friendly ol' man, who assumed I knew NOTHING about self-service machines... and probably doubted my ability to read, for he explained step-by-step what I needed to do in order to check out my books. At least the lesson was in-depth enough for me to fully comprehend - and then some. So, the next time I went to SPL - to pick up the books I had put on hold (score!) - I used the self-service check-out. I was in and out in like 7.46 minutes. So, let's recap:*SLP has books!*SLP doesn't always have the books you want. (Sad face)*You can renew online, create a profile and share reviews. *You can place books on-hold from any computer, if you're logged into your account.*People working there are friendly.*It's easy to get a card. Just bring in your SRP bill, like I did. *It's not an easy place to browse.*SPL doesn't make you feel like you want to spend hours there.*There are private rooms; just not sure how you reserve them.*There are monthly activities at the library - but mostly about old-fart diets and how to use Microsoft Word. *There's FREE parking in THE SHADE! *You can check your items out yourself, with their self-service check-out machine. *It's pretty ugly inside - brown, biege, dull and lifeless.~~#~0
They are the best!  99% of my pain in my back is gone, thanks to Patrick O'Brien and assistant Joshua.Bonnie Wills~~#~1
Lazy Q CLOSED in 2010.  New Owners cleaned up the place and its called JESTERS BILLIARDS.  Tons of beer, AC smoking patio with pool tables.  Re-did tables and got new cues.  Its rockin now.~~#~1
It's called America's friendliest airport for a reason- it truly embodies world class service to all. I love it here it's clean, great places to eat and smiling faces to great you esp at TSA!~~#~1
What a great surprise stumbling across this bank!  Open 7 days a week with lobby serviceI have banked with the Mega Uber Banks and have been nickeled and dimed (literally) with service fees.I opened both a savings and checking account here.  Since my company does not offer direct deposit the associate told me I would have to have a traditional checking account with service fees.  I'm thinking - here we go again.  But it was one of those think on your feet moments.  Off they went (I'll assume to get approval).   They let me open up a type of checking account that only charges you for check printing - No other fees and pays interest.  In fact, if you use a non-MidFirst Bank ATM, they will refund you the service fees.  How refreshing with the current state of banking.~~#~1
Lavelle's just opened the end of April. So far I've been twice once for lunch and once for ice cream. Both times I waited about 15 minutes. Understandable considering their new. I wanted to make my own type of sandwich and the older women said they don't do that. Okay. So I wanted to get the arizona sandwich with a different bread, she says the bread change is 1.00. Really?! Sandwich also had no mayo/mustard. All in all it's good to have new restaurants out here, but this one is just okay.**Update: I have went in on 2 different dates to get ice cream. Only to find out the 2 flavors I want are gone. Should get back-ups of their items.~~#~0
short leash is awesome! we tried the sample platter and they delivered it to us inside the bar. we were also given an additional sample tray to try for free. everything was delicious and had a very unique take on a common american snack. I can't wait until they come back!~~#~1
So I had this important event to attend in California and I've already spent a lot of money preparing for my trip. Earlier in the month I had received a coupon for $40 off any service at Epic salon. Wow, that is a lot of savings and I could sure use to save some money. Epic uses  Goldwell products which is my product of choice. I just needed a tint touch-up (about 1") so I went to this salon... I had already had an awesome experience at another salon in town, but I couldn't pass up the savings by using the $40 coupon)  I was second-guessing the idea of trying a new salon since I had already found one I absolutly loved. .Again though, the coupon lured me in. Anyway, I walked away with the worst experience ever. Not only was my color wrong ( I am a golden blonde and she colored my 1' outgrowth to a 3" ash) when I went back in to explain what was so wrong with it (5min later), the front desk lady was rude and cut me off as I was speaking to her. Not the best way to handle a pissed of lady expecially about her hair! I gave them a chance to fix it and the only thing they did was put a gold glaze on my hair, which did not help at all.  The style sucked too. I just left. I did not have time to see if they could fix it again. I will not be going back to this place for any services. Noy only because the hair experience was bad, but because the front desk gal made a bad impession of the place even worse with her nastiness. UGH! I will give this place 1 star only because on the coupon was also a savings of 30% off products.~~#~1
Visiting a friend who insisted we come to Carolina's on my first morning in town to get a breakfast burrito To Die For.She was totally spot-on.These delicious hand-made tortillas are fantastic!  I wish I could take a bunch back to Seattle with me, but since they're freshly-made, I'm guessing the lack of preservatives will make that a better idea than reality.I enjoyed the chorizo, egg, and potato burrito with plenty of salsa.  I loved the spicy/smooth combo with the sour cream in the burrito.I hope I get a chance to eat here again before leaving town!~~#~1
I've passed by prestige nails in walmart 100s of times but never really thought of having a pedicure there (even though they are always busy!) As I stared at my feet, long overdue for a pedicure, I thought it was about time to try them...since walmart rarely let's me down why should the nail salon inside?To my surprise I got a wonderful pedicure or $23 not too bad this day in age...my to mention it was just as good as going to the more upscale salon just across the street! I'm glad to be the first to review them they deserve it! Now if only they did facials at walmart and hair I'd be set!~~#~1
Stadium was REALLY nice... the MORONS in control of the parking...not so much.  I understand that you're not going to get doctors/lawyers/rocket scientists to control parking and move traffic in and out of the game.  HOWEVER, it would be nice if Glendale would pull their heads out of their butts and build a new on/off ramp for the stadium.  It took over 30mins to get out of the parking lot!!  To make it worse..the Cards lost :(~~#~0
First hole in one on #3. I'll always love you Vistal.~~#~1
I would typically never write a review for strbucks because it is all the same.  I mean that in the best possible way as i have come to expct a certain level of service and quality.  Starbucks is amazing for kids as my dzughter oly drinks warm milk and so anywhere i see a starbucks i can ge a kids milk.  I have had  great serive at this location.  Since i could not find the starbucks at the asu bookstore location, i am using this review too but really the five stars is for this location. I wanted to give the asu location one star.  My barista NOEl today was exceptionaaly rude. She did not know how to make nor ring up a kids drink and when it  came up wrong instead of offering to fix it told me that  is how it is done.  If my other experiences weren t so good with starbucks i would have switched over to petes.  If you happen to be the starbucks manager at the asu bookstore location too, NOEL definitely could use some more training in both drink preparation and customer service.Sorry for the spelling areas but i am typing on my iphone and havent found the pellchck option yet.~~#~1
The place was just your typical stable, but my wife and I had a wonderful experience here. It was our first time riding, so the staff took great care to show us how to mount and maneuver the horses. We then followed a guide through an orchard for an hour's ride (just the right length of time for us as beginners). The horses were very tame, and were easy to ride. The best part of the experience, however, was our interaction with the staff. They couldn't have been more friendly and more helpful. We're excited to go back.~~#~1
As a sissy vegetarian, I feel compelled to mention the soup that no one has yet mentioned at Da Vang - THE TAMARIND BASED SOUP HOT POT IS AMAZING!I don't know if they use any other animal broth in it, because I am willfully ignorant of such matters.  Regardless, if you are a meat eater or a vegetarian, try the tamarind soup, and bring friends.  It is super yummy.They also have a rice-based soup.  And, if you talk to your server, they can likely recommend some vegetarian/tofu based dishes that will be wonderful.Everything else is as good as everyone says it is.  Wouldn't be surprised if people got an occasional bowl of sub-par pho; every family restaurant makes mistakes.  I'd recommend everyone try it again.~~#~1
One of the WORST experiences of my life.  My friends and I decided to go and check this place out as the local radio kept talking about it.  So the day we decide to go, the guy from the Colbert report was there mocking the restaurant also.  We go in and we thought, "hey wow, this is kinda cool" as they talked about monster proportions of burgers and fries fried in lard.  However, once the food arrived we sat down and although the wait staff was scantily clad, all of them had "cottage cheese" legs and thighs.  We sat down, and my friend decides to take their super burger challenge, she said if he finished his 2 lbs burger, his meal would be on the house.  He kills it, and when we ask why his burger wasn't free, we could no longer find out waitress and the owner says to us "you either pay or i come over the counter" he threatened us with violence, which is stupid as all we were doing was asking what about what the waitress had told us.  We will never ever go there again.  Being Asian, he also spewed racial slurs at us, calling us to go back to where we came from.  ALL of us were born and raised in Arizona so I don't know where we would go.  Anyways, don't go here.  Also, all of the patrons, ALL of them were middle aged men, who instead of paying attention to their wives and kids were hiding away at a nasty restaurant who's burgers aren't even really grilled.  the frozen patties from costco are placed on a machine that rolls the burgers through, so you can't even want a medium burger, they are all torched.  The fries although fried in lard, are crap.  All in all, if you're a lonely loser, this is the place for you.  If you're a classy kinda guy that wants REAL food, go to any other generic burger place and you will be more satisfied.~~#~1
I totally agree with L.C.'s review.  Going to XCP made college seem like a breeze.  Yes, there were the typical high school dramatics, but I feel like the teachers were able to take a harder line on discipline, since they weren't in fear of getting in hot water with the public school district.  I had an overall great experience here, and I love meeting people all over the country that have gone to Xavier.  My last flight home, the person in the seat next to me went there, and we had tons of people/things to chat about.  It's fun to see where everyone has ended up, and it is fun to get together with fellow alums for drinks here in Chicago, and when I am back home in AZ.  I think it is so sad that the girls don't get to do freshman swimming, sophomore dances, or go to dockers anymore - those were some defining moments of my XCP career.  I don't know much about other private schools cropping up in the growing valley, but if I had kids, they would be headed to Xavier and Brophy!~~#~1
I've been going here for 10 years. My relationship began when I needed a bunch of clothes tailored for my first trip to Europe. I needed everything quickly and was very specific. She got everything done in time for my trip. Over the years I've brought dozens of clothes. She's done everything from changing a dress into a top to adding bra pads to a cocktail dress. She's hemmed and taken in. She's shortened straps and helped me change out fabric in clothing to create a completely different look. I can communicate anything I want and she'll have it done exactly the way I envisioned it. We've been able to change things so much we sometimes recreate new looks. Her prices are a little high but well worth the quality. Every single person I've recommended has been extremely pleased with her work.~~#~1
I wish I could give this location a big fat ZERO.But you can't.  But I can let everyone know how horrible it is.For starters, their automatic doors do not even work.  I just find that appalling.  How can your doors not work on your store?  How are people supposed to get in there to shop.The manager of this location is nothing more than a jerk.  I asked for help and all I received was attitude.For a struggling supermarket that filed for bankruptcy, I would think service would be one thing you could promote at no cost.  But, not here.I don't think it will be long before this location closes.  RIP!~~#~1
A group of us were there for drinks late Saturday night, the bar is really cool, well thought out and decorated. Drink menu, cocktails and draft beers are all exceptional. Only challenge was it was almost impossible to get the attention of the bar staff, I am not sure that since we were a large group and had a tab running that only one batman could serve us but it was really frustrating having bar staff just ignore us! Other wise the place is great........~~#~0
YUUKK!!!That pretty much describes this place.  We went there on Sunday afternoon for lunch.  Only 1 person in line in front of us.  I ordered the 2 meat combo, rib tips and hot links...sides of mac & cheese and potato salad.   ...it took about 40 mins to get my food.  But I told myself if it was good...then it's worth the wait.  But by God it wasn't good at all.  The mac & cheese had no flavor at all...i mean none.  The potato salad was very flavorless as well.  The rib tips would have been good if they weren't covered in 5 gallons of bbq sauce, nasty bbq sauce at that.  Their sauce is like a sweet and sour sauce...was not good at all.  The hot links were mixed in with the rib tips and covered in the same sauce.  So couldn't tell if they were any good, cause there was so much of that damn sauce.The funny part was that the couple that ordered right after me, got their food and took it right back to the counter and straight out said that the food was just disgusting.  I wish I would have done the same instead of spending $15+ on nasty bbq.In short.  I will not be going back here.~~#~1
Can't say enough about this place. We were amazed by the room and it's stylings and even more amazed with the pool and the view from it. We were on a mission to chill and found the perfect place. Views of Camelback Mountain and a staff that knew what they were doing. Try the brie quesadillas and the Sanctuary lemonade.~~#~1
Do you want to eat Chinese Food in an elegant environment on a Friday night in Phoenix? Be entertained by classic, quiet standards being played live on a piano while you dine?Are you 50 years old and Caucasian?Then the Golden Buddha is the place for you! Its in the Chinese Cultural Center Mall on 44th, and a popular weekend spot for Dim Sum. For a DIm Sum starved Valley of the Sun, Golden Buddha's is decent. For dinner, though, it is awfully Americanized and not very authentic Chinese. But with a bunch of American customers coming for dinner, what do you expect? They probably think they are getting "real Chinese" food by going to the Chinese Mall, but then again, they are used to PF Chang's or Stix normally in their neighborhood, so this is a step up.The best thing about this place is the decor, which is clean and nice, with a Hong Kong Junk boat design covering the ceiling from the bar into the dining room. The next best thing is the Piano interludes on weekend nights. The service is next, which is a little overly eager to remove your plate, and the last thing is the food. They do give decent portions. I ordered Guo Teh (potstickers) and got 6 fat ones. But they weren't served with the usual soy, chili oil and vinegar, but a soy and green onions mixture. The Mapo Tofu was ok, as they used a nice silky tofu, which was nice, but no green onions, and sliced black mushrooms instead, which I like, but not in this dish.Come here for the ambiance and music in the evenings, or on the weekend days for Dim Sum.~~#~0
My experience at Old Town Tortilla Factory is probably very different than that of the average patron. I dined here with a semi-private party with 40 other guests and we were served buffet-style.Our group was seated in their outdoor dining area, which I absolutely loved. I thought the atmosphere was great and brought an authentic Southwest feel and vibe to the restaurant. The food was as decent as you would expect sharing buffet-style with 40 other people lined up outdoors: nothing mind-blowingly memorable, but nothing too bad, either.My one complaint would be the servers. Especially at our single table of 8, it did not seem the server we were assigned was equipped to take care of a large group. There was much unnecessary confusion at the end of the night when it came down to settling some bar tabs. Overall, it did not ruin our experience, but definitely took away from the overall positivity. Regardless, I would love to come back here with a smaller group and enjoy a fresh plate of food! The outdoor dining is definitely something you can't pass up...~~#~0
I'll check this place out, despite the whinings of a few.~~#~0
Always a marvelous experience. The patio area is simply lovely if the weather is permitting. The menus are always excellent and they have an excellent staff. The cheese plate is always great to start and the servers will help you pick a good selection of cheeses and suggest very good wines. The food is always very good and also unique -- rabbit is one of my favourite proteins they prepare here. I have been there for Valentine's Day and also for our wedding anniversary and the always make the evening special. It is pricey but worth every penny you pay.~~#~1
I just stopped in tonight after the gym, I was a bit stinky and what better way to fix that than 16 bars of soap.It was late 8:15 when I walked in :15 before close. This is a great time to shop when you are in a rush. It was empty, and the lines were short.Despite benign the end of a long day the low turnover staff was great and personally recognized me and greeted me.~~#~1
This place is so good! I have eaten almost everything on the menu. It is not the fanciest of places but it is great to go with friends and buy a ton of delicious food for very little money. I would recommend this place I go often.~~#~1
I'll start with the positive.  They have some friendly members of staff.  That's it.  You might catch a staff infection here, so watch out.  It's like a shack that somehow got a bar licence.  I have a friend who drags me here on occasion as it's his favourite dive.  It's one wrong glance away from a fight, every time.  If you like the danger and excitement of drinking a beer in a building that may collapse on you, go for it.  If not, avoid the dregs of society and go somewhere else.~~#~1
The new location is big, open, and a bit more like a dinner spot rather than a mish-mosh diner. But that's just aesthetics, I realize.The food is great. I had the pad thai and tried one of the duck dishes. I'm not a huge fan of duck, but this was nice and tender and the sauce was amazing. Whatever sauce it had on it was composed of peppers, mushrooms and ground pork, if that helps you find it on the menu. The drunken dragon is also fabulous, and at $7 for lunch and $10 for dinner, Yupha's a steal. I just finished the other half of my pad thai a minute ago. Yum.I think it's my favorite Thai in the greater campus area, but then I thought about it and, isn't most of the good food in the Phoenix area in the Tempe area? I think so. Anyway, Yupha is one cool lady and you can tell they're trying hard with this grand opening. A little ass-kissing is nice, but then again, places like these are for regulars, so I guess they don't have to be overly nice to me. I'm just here to grub.EAT HERE. And ask for twice the spicy you would normally. The medium is not spicy and the thai hot is medium.~~#~1
This place is too freaking cute!!!  The OJ is literally one of the best glasses I've ever had.  I had the typical eggs, bacon, and toast and it was amazing.  The bacon was crispy without being burnt, the toast had just the right level of buttery goodness and the eggs were folded such as a crepe and fluffy goodness.  I also tried a bite of the pulled pork burger which was amazing, and the touch of apple put it over the top.  Another plus was the garden patio area that feels homey like someones backyard.  I will definitely be back to this cozy establishment!~~#~1
Great tourist fare. When we have family in town that appreciate a 32oz porterhouse more than a delicate sashimi, this is where we head. It is quite the drive from Phoenix, but portions are large and service is always prompt and friendly.~~#~0
This is a great relaxing spot to stop for breakfast. The food is always amazing and the atmosphere is something that will send you into the right mood to enjoy the rest of your day. I wish there where more spots like this on the civic center park it's such a great location.~~#~1
I found this restaurant when they were located in Buckeye. I have tried everything on the menu probably more than once and have never been disappointed. My favorite is the Red-Chili Frybread with cheese added. The service is excellent there. You always get treated friendly and with a smile!~~#~1
Not a bad place.  Pizza was good but stay away from the wraps as the flatbread wasn't meant for that.~~#~0
Like watching a train wreck in slow motion will definitely be going somewhere else for bagels from now on disappointing have been going there for years.  The eight day old cream cheese was a nice touch (yuck!)~~#~1
Unfortunately, my birthday always falls right around Mother's Day.  Which means that every time I want to go out to eat for my birthday it is packed.  We thought we'd celebrate early by going on Saturday, but it was still packed.  We called ahead and the earliest reservation was 9 PM, but the person on the phone said that if we just came down, they would fit us in.So we sat at the bar for maybe 20 minutes (IN YOUR FACE CHAIN RESTAURANTS!!!) and our beers came with a small appetizer of cheese and salami.  These people think of everything. And the wait staff is pretty damn attentive.  The hostess heard me say something about my birthday, which was passed on to the waitress so my super huge and yummy meal ended with a delicious dessert of my choosing.  The bread and relish tray would have been more than enough of an appetizer for me, but my partners in crime also wanted the spinach artichoke dip, which was soooo tasty.  My steak was SOFT but cooked exactly how I like it.  These are true professionals.  Asparagus was cooked perfectly.  The chicken pot pie soup was exactly what I expected and so yummy.  And the dessert?  Triple creme brulee - kahlua which tasted like a caucasian, chocolate which managed to be super chocolately but not too rich, and a mixed berry that would have been fabulous if I was a normal rasberry eating human.Yes, it's a little pricey, but you easily get 2 meals if not more out of one dish.  Especially with the yummy bread and relish tray that is also presented before the meal.  The atmosphere is cozy and a little crowded.  If you are wierd about personal space, this is probably not the place to go.Overall: I love this place and go every time I get the opportunity.~~#~1
I always said that my last meal on earth would consist of the AZ88 Chicken Sandwich and a dirty martini.  That was until I went there again the other night after a couple year hiatus.  The magic, was gone.  I was so disappointed and sad that it wasn't as memorable as I previously remember.  I will go back and try something else because I didn't have a bad experience and never have.I recently sat at the bar and had 2 different bartenders.  Both were great and entertaining.  And, it doesn't help that they poured a strong and delicious drink.  Get a martini!!~~#~0
We were here on Wednesday, 12/21/11. We had been at a Rubios in CA recently and was extremely disappointed. Not this time!Jacob was our order taker and was VERY courteous and professional. My husband got two fish tacos that were a good size and yummie. I went with the grilled veggie burrito and man, it was huge and tasty!This is what Rubios is about!~~#~1
This place is the best place I've found so far for sushi in the Phoenix area.  The wait staff is always attentive, the sushi isn't overpriced and  their specialty sushis are actually good.  They stick to the basics, and don't veer too much into the west for their ideas.  The plates and silverware are clean, which is more than I was able to say at a different place I'd tried.  The sushi prices are similar to other places I've seen - except you get 3 pieces, not 2.  They don't stick too much rice in the rolls.  The pieces can sometimes push the limit, but most are manageable.  All in all, this is a great place that I will come back to time and again.~~#~1
This company is Awesome!!! I was recommended to go here by a friend and was hesitant since it was my first time going to a salon. I was extremely impressed with how welcoming they are and how dedicated they are to making your experience unforgettable. They gave me a facial massage treatment thing that was out of this world. The entire day I walked around with my face forward and could not stop talking about how great I felt. I will be visiting quite often. Thank you so much!John Paul D.~~#~1
A very nice pizza.  I haven't made up my mind which is more authentic, NYPD or Ray's.  Both, have the thin NY style crust, but NYPD makes me feel like I'm waiting for an E train to Queens; whereas Ray's feels more upper east side-ish.~~#~0
This place does it right, but hold on to your walet! U have to try the Yellow butter cake, its over the top.~~#~1
Amazing selection of beers with great tabs educating you on them and often ratings.  Wine and booze selections are great too.  Killer store like candyland for adults.  Prices are excellent and so is service if you need help finding something.  Great place!~~#~1
Just have to rave about Becca and Todd's Zoo tour on a Segway. It was the highlight of our trip to Scottsdale.  I had never been on a Segway before but it was so easy and Becca taught me all the tricks.  We never would have visited the Phoenix Zoo if it was not for the Segway tour.  It was fun, easy and worth every penny.~~#~1
Absolutely disgusting.  I had enchiladas and a taco, just to give them a chance.  This was the worst mexican food I've ever had.  Waaaaaay too much government tasting cheese on the food, and hardly any meat.  I do have really high standards because I grew up on Tex-Mex but this was just pathetic......~~#~1
Fabulous! This was my son- in -laws Restaurant Week choice and an excellent one. Lots of menu choices, a drink included and excellent service from the moment we arrived until we left. We will return soon and often.~~#~1
Just OK.  But like pizza and sex, there really is no bad BBQ.  I think there is something lost in translation from its Texas roots to AZ.  Gone is the appeal of the gas station dive.  Atmosphere feels a little phony in a pretty, new building.  The biggest problems I have with the food is the overpowering mesquite flavor and mediocre sauces.  The Texas roots explains the loyalty to mesquite, which is understandable and you cant fault them for staying true... but a little hickory or less creosote-tasting smoke would be nice for a non-Texas palette.  The sauces seem a little amateur.  I know Rudy's is no amateur in the business, but I think they settled too soon on their signature sauces - they taste like the first ones I made in my backyard.  If a true amateur (me) can evolve into better sauces, so can Rudys.  Now I need to stop at the new BBQ joint next door to see which one will get my BBQ dollars... stay tuned.~~#~0
Oh Rhythm Room, how I adore thee!I have seen some of the greatest Blues legends play here and have never been disappointed.   Whenever The Rhythm Room All-stars play, I definitely try to make it.  They are rockin'.  I dig the dancing, the bbq (mmmmmm)  and I enjoy when the f*ck the police guy is roller skating on the dance floor!I do recommend getting there early if you want a table and a chair.  For bands I really want to see I get there before they open, get in line, get a table, then someone in my party goes to grab us some bbq and we start drinking and eating and waiting for the music to start!  I always have a great time here!  And now that you can't smoke it's even better!~~#~1
I was here for a business dinner recently and loved their new hummus plate.  They put grilled zucchini on it and had some fresh jicama which was awesome.  I wasn't in the mood for BBQ at the time but so I ordered a turkey burger which came on a whole wheat bun and some steamed broccoli.  I love the healthy options.  Thanks to Red Robin for helping to fight the battle of the bulge.  Just make sure you bring lots of will power when come here because it's easy to blow it...especially with the desert menu!!~~#~0
Very good place for breakfast & lunch tucked away in the crowded shops at 44th & Camelback.  I kinda found this place on accident.  I meant to just run into AJs and grab a salad to go, but was forced to park basically across the driveway from Taylor's, and, being closer, I opted to go there instead.  Taylor's is open 6-4ish (I couldn't really tell, they probably just changed the hours and scratched off the hour number on the door), and they serve breakfast all day- well, all day they're actually open- which is always good with me.  I was in the mood for corned beef, and , bingo, there it was.  Nice mound of lean tasty beef with melty cheese (no saurkraut or thousand island, please.).  And the bread- oh the bread- grilled to be crispy on the edges but still soft inside.  How in the hell do they do it?  I don't know, but I'm in love.~~#~1
Man oh Man!   Since leaving New York six and a half years ago I have been in search of good Chinese Food.  I had gotten to the point where I would have even settled for "decent".  A work colleague suggested that we dine here on the way to a corporate meeting.  While I realized that he was a native to the Phoenix Metro Area and had probably never even had the real thing, I trusted his palate and restaurant sense.  I was so pleased when we walked in and saw that the diners were predominately Asian.  I knew that  a great  Asian market was next door as well and these things were the first things that signaled to me that I was probably going to get good food.  I was thrilled to see familiar Dim Sum carts rolling through.  We were a party of 7 and shared around.  The food was fantastic!  Dim sum was fresh and succulent.  Our orders from the menu were equally delicious.  The veggies were fresh and brightly colored.  The tastes distinctive and delicious.  The Hot and Sour Soup was perfect filled with all kinds of Chinese mushrooms etc.  I was delighted and reminisced about the many fantastic dinners in Chinatown NY. This food was comparable.  I do not live close by, but I will be a regular there.  Chandler is clear on the other side of the World from me but I figure if Marco Polo could do it, so can I!  Phoenix Palace is the REAL Thing!!!  Friendly prompt service rounded out the experience.  Hooray for Phoenix Palace!~~#~1
More than the food, the place is cute. What it looks like from the outside does no justice for the inside. Very Americanized Asian food so if you're looking for authentic... don't come here.~~#~0
We use to visit this Pub 10 years ago because they had a nice English waitress and excellent fish and chips for the price.  However, we went back a few weeks ago and boy were we disappointed.  The price of the fish and chip dinner went up and they cut the portion in half.  No one assisted us in putting two tables together, we had to do it ourselves.  Two guests wanted a good English hot tea and they didn't brew it in advance, it was just thrown into a small metal tea pot and we had to ask for cream and sugar.  So we've decided there are newer and better places to eat fish and chips, especially up in north Phoenix.~~#~1
My rating is based on the fact that as a vegetarian, they charge $8 for a small mediocre bean burrito.  Maybe if this bean burrito were exceptionally good or large in size, but it was neither.  I'm not saying that if your idea of Mexican food is Chipolte, you will not find what you are looking for and be happy here. But if what you offer your vegetarian customers is deleting the meat and not adding anything else and charging full price, I can get MUCH BETTER elsewhere and pay way less.  GRINGOS:  Take off the Chipolte blindfolds!  Go to a real Mexican restaurant and see what real food is supposed to taste like!~~#~1
This place has gone so downhill. If I hadnt gotten my chips, salsa & water immediately, I wouldve walked out. Margaritas are always awesome. But the service and food is straight up AWFUL. Microwaved enchiladas, no rice, rude, cold, unfriendly, uninviting service...If you're looking for a fabulous, neighborhood mexican restaurant, try Las Glorias Grill. The location isnt as great, but the food, service and drinks, blows this place outta the water. After years of going to aunt chiladas, Im NEVER going back again. They dont deserve your money either....~~#~1
First time here, new favorite. You can create your own antipasti plate, and the pretzels and fondue are AMAZING. Also the ricotta gnocchi is the best I have ever had. Service was good, Liz was our waitress and she was very friendly and helpful. Monkey bread is also stellar. I cannot wait to go back.~~#~1
This little spot in the art district of Scottsdale is as good a lunch restaurant as I've been to.  I had the mahi mahi tacos, and was blown away by the attention to detail in the flavors bringing the dish together, as well as the wonderfully tasteful presentation.  Of particular note was the attractiveness level of the waitresses, about which I don't have sufficient words to do justice.  Both my father and I were hard pressed not to buy a condo in Scottsdale just to stay and have all our meals for the rest of our life there solely to appreciate the view.  They were dressed tastefully, not in the slightest bit 'slutty', but holy god.~~#~1
I have been frequenting this spot since they opened and have always said they were better than Starbucks but Iam in a special kind of heaven after the change in menu and addition of pressed tea lattes!!! Yum, yum, yum!!! Far better than Starbucks powdered green tea latte and roughly a dollar cheaper than the high priced cup there as well. The early morning staff is great and free WiFi is an added bonus. I can honestly say for the New Year, I'm quitting you Starbucks......and mean it.~~#~1
I'm never shopping here, I don't wanna shop somewhere where associates think if u can afford it in just goona purchase the bag online then looked at if I could afford it~~#~1
Food was good. Slow service. First time that I've had to walk outside through a parking lot to get to the bathroom.~~#~0
I have totally fallen in love at Tuck Shop.  Everything here is fantastic.  My friend and I come here about twice a month and enjoy some snacks and wine.  The beer battered Cheese Curds may just change your life for the better... we are seriously tempted to each get our own order. (I am not very good at sharing and i always get what I want!   ...No i'm not an only child... well, maybe I was until i was 11, how did you know.  WAH!)   Oh, and Laura is fantastic.  She always takes great care of us as we enjoy a glass of wine on the couch in the reading room.  Thursday's special is meat loaf... don't deny yourself, just indulge.  :)~~#~1
Your reviews are hilarious!!   (shoot--who was this referring to??)I try to avoid WM.  I'm always warned about the possibility of TB or now, pig flu.  I think the hub just doesn't want to go shopping--not that I LIKE shopping.I know someone who worked WM in WA and she says the conditions are just horrible for employees.  I've spoken to at least one cashier that is actually FRIENDLY and LOVES his job benefits and bonuses.  He's a minority I guess bc as you all said, YOU CAN'T FIND ANYTHING and CAN'T GET HELP without attitude, usually.  I'm standing there staring at 2 mgrs, and they just ignore me for a few minutes?  I didn't want to interrupt the conversation, so I waited.  FINALLY, one asks if I need help???  NAAAAAH, I was just admiring your huge body and wondered how long it might take me to look that way.  FOOLS!  On my last visit, a customer said "excuse me" to the 3 employees behind me in the aisle.  I glanced at her and she sighed, rolled her eyes and shook her head as they all ignored her.  I chuckled and acknowledged her frustration.  Then one employee pipes up with "OH, I'm sorry ma'am, can we help you?"  She asks to find an item, the customer thanks them, they say "You're welcome", the customer leaves and they sarcastically continue to each other: "THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR.  NO, THAT'S NOT WHY WE'RE HERE.  We're not here to find stuff for stupid people, we have better things to do."    That's why, when I walk by an employee working, if they lay eyes on me, they immediately look away and pretend to be engrossed in their job, to avoid stopping to help.  WT?  What's wrong w/this management???  I agree, you can find some deals and save some money, but the attitude is over the top.  There are a FEW employees that actually smile and appear friendly, at least when I see them, and I can point them out.  If not for the more often than not occurences as mentioned above, I stay OUT of WM as much as possible, which is a lot.  I've drastically reduced my trips there, but more importantly, I've cut out a huge chunk of purchasing from WM.~~#~1
I am one step closer to completing my goal.  I want to visit every Grimaldis in the US before I die.  After tonights visit to this one, I have most of AZ taken care of.We decided to come here because we had never been to this one.  We arrived and were seated right away.  Surprisingly this one wasn't crowded at all and that was fine by us.  We got a small caesar salad, a small pepperoni and garlic, and a personal white pizza with roasted red peppers.  A few minutes later we got our salad.  It was really good.  Just enough dressing, lots of cheese and croutons.  It was a good starter.  A few minutes after that, our pizza came out.  If you have read my other reviews, you will know that I think Grimaldis is the best.....this pizza was no different.  I really liked the white with roasted red peppers.  Everything was delicious and even though there was some doubt we could finish off 2 pizzas, I turned on my inner fat boy, and finished off all the pizza.  It was tough, but someone had to do it....little kids are starving in Africa somewhere....lll be damned if I'm going to waste some slices of this amazing pizza.  Down the hatch it went....my stomach doesn't like me right now because its so full, but he will forgive me once he doesn't get any of this delicatessen back in San Diego LOL.~~#~1
As good as I always remember it to be.Their fries are way better than In-n-Out (I am a fries connoisseur)Their burgers may be getting smaller? Still delicious as ever.I pass on the drink though, an extra $2+ makes the meal quite expensive..Price: $9+ for the cheeseburger (double) and Regular fries(in-n-out: $6+ for double-double and fries - half the size)I would eat here every day if I had the option.~~#~1
Went here on Wednesday to take advantage of the $30 certificate. It was quite busy, which probably shouldn't of been a shock, location and all, so had to wait awhile but that is the risk of not getting reservations right? =P. Anyways, spent time in the bar which was nice, the bartenders were willing to answer questions, though not always the most chatty, but I think that was due more to how busy it was then not being friendly. The happy hour prices looked pretty good, $2 hot sake, $3 beer, $4-5 cocktails. Sushi was also on the cheap, Nigiri was from about 1.25-2 dollars I believe, and the other rolls ran from 3-5 dollars at the worst. They also have some non-sushi appetizers on there. Once we got a table, we were paired with another group, which was actually a nice experience as I do like the communal type seating stuff. Granted if you have a small group and not a fan of eating with strangers, might not like it much. Since it is a place I always consider more about a show then the food, going to start with that first. The show was eh, they do some of the knife play stuff, and a few things here and there, but honestly it wasn't all that exciting compared to the other place I've been (Sakura). The chef was friendly though, and the server was personable so that is a plus. Otherwise was a bit disappointed with the show portion of the meal. As for the food, I had the Filet Mignon and lobster tail. The filet was supposed to be medium, but came out more medium well in my opinion. It was lightly seasoned, leaving mostly a beef flavor then anything else. Now it had a good beef flavor, so by no means complaining just like a bit more seasoning personally. The lobster tail was good, buttery from the butter, but more importantly nice and sweet. How it is to other lobster tails? can't really tell you as I don't eat it that much (college students don't exactly have that sort of cash you know? =P). But again thought it was good, wasn't fishy and nice and sweet. At the end it came with a choice of ice cream, I tried the green tea ice cream which about the same as any other green tea ice cream I've had. Basically its sweet, with a hint of green tea taste, and that is about it. They have to sing to you of course, and they take a picture which they give you with a code you can access for up to 60 days (I believe) to download it, which is a nice touch. For the money, I really wouldn't go unless I had the certificate, however I would go back for the happy hour, probably my favorite thing of the whole night.~~#~0
This was the second time I placed an order over the phone that was delayed over an hour. I was told over the phone that it was going to be only 15-20 min for me to pick it up. I showed up 30 min later and my order was still delayed. I ended waiting for another half of hour to receive my order. The pick up service was the worse I have ever experienced.~~#~1
Great in its day, now leaves a lot to be desired.  Deserves credit as a Phoenix landmark Chinese restaurant.  This restaurant has been here for 38 years.  I've been going here off and on for 35 years.  I go here more for sentimental reasons, and not so much for the food.  The interior still retains some of the original decoration style from the original restaurant established nearly 40 years ago.  The rest of the decorations have been torn out.  I believe the decor is modeled after the Forbidden Palace in Beijing - see the vault-of-the-heavens style crenelations in the ceiling.  I have this restaurant - in its former self - to thank for this:  Back in its day, this restaurant was really great, and the entire atmosphere lent to an ambiance that actually inspired me to study Chinese and then later go live over there for some years. Sadly, the food here is not all that good.  The fryer oil they use here is pretty old.  The fried rice arrives looking almost black (from the fryer oil?  too much soy sauce?) instead of a rich golden brown, and tastes overcooked somehow.  The eggrolls are just OK.  Definitely not fresh.A lot of the menu items from the original owners are no longer on the menu; for example the special "Chinese cakes" served on a plate topped with a delicious gravy-like brown sauce and shallots - probably some form of Cantonese food.  All of this is gone, and replaced by very plain fare, and not very good at that.  If you like salty, greasy, plain-tasting yet somehow edible Chinese food not far from the $1-per-scoop variety, then go here.  Golden Phoenix's heyday as a great restaurant is long-gone.  Let us bow our heads in sadness to a place that once was very good - now passed on...~~#~1
Love this place, it's on our dinner rotation. The owners and wait staff always greet us since we are regulars. Great place and cheap too. Try the #100 its the best ever.~~#~1
Took my daughter to Mendy's Place 4 times. Treatments, doctors, nurses and other staff were great.My complaint is that the ER physicians are not in-network (participating) with most insurance companies. Even though the hospital is participating, the physicians are not , thus resulting in larger physician bills.Us consumers pay dearly for our health insurance. I don't like being overcharged by greedy physicians.~~#~0
I don't know what's up with Eddie??? I always found him to be pleasant, and really taking care of the customers. However on the 17th of November we had a birthday party of 19 people, and they gave us one waitress. We sat down at 7:00 pm and our main course came at 9:15. No real big deal but one person can't handle a table of 19, and we were having fun. So one of the guest's had ordered the $12.00 burger along with a salad and told the waitress no Mayo because he can't stand it at all. The burger comes out and it has Mayo on it, and he tells the waitress. She was not at fault, and had written it down clearly. He asked for a new one, and she comes back and say's Eddie cooked the hamburger and refused to cook a new one but would make him a new bun. He didn't want that because he hates Mayo that much, so there was no problem taking it off the tab, but Eddie would not make a new one. LOL. What's up Eddie??? I don't understand at all, you take it off the bill because you screwed up, but refuse to make another burger that you would have been paid for.  Then you end up looking like a fool in front of the other eighteen people. My daughter has even taken one of your classes, and said what a great guy you are. Really, Really bad PR that night and the next birthday party wont be at Eddie's House. Great time that night, but the ending leaves a very bad taste in 19 people's mouth.~~#~1
Owned and operated by Eugenia Theodosopoulos (an Ohio native, fyi) and considered by many to be the best patisserie/bakery in the state I approached Essence with a note of skepticism largely assuming much of the hype was derived from Tempe's plethoric college crowd but arriving at the doors of the small shop on a particularly lovely 80 degree morning I gathered quite quickly that my original conceptions were misplaced; not only does Essence not look like a college haunt, neither do its prices or products - a vast selection of at least twenty items aside from the posted menu sitting beneath and atop a glass case forcing me to make more than one tough decision that was not helped by my server's accurate assessment that everything was really good.Now bearing in mind that the original impetus to visit Tempe on this particular morning was to visit Caffe Boa and that Essence was more of 'pre-meal' activity what follows may seem slightly gluttonous, but to be fair once I took my first bite of Theodosopoulos's École Lenôtre trained almond croissant I knew I was in good hands and everything else just sort of followed.  Without a doubt my favorite breakfast pastry and perhaps my favorite French pastry overall, Essence's $3 twice baked option arrives slightly smaller than the average but with a shell that crackles to the tooth and an interior that is at once yawning pockets of air and nearly overloaded with butter and light frangipane there is no doubt that this is a case of "big things in small packages," and particularly in its still-warm morning state the flavors and textures rivaled those at Dominique Ansel and Payard Las Vegas for best I've had stateside.Moving next from the baked goods to one prepared from the menu my second taste of the morning aside from the slightly earthy and lightly leather accented coffee was Essence's "Signature" French Toast, a $7.25 selection featuring three griddled slices of eggy brioche and a sidecar of what I can best describe as banana infused caramel.  Rich but thinly sliced and therefore nicely saturated each piece of the French Toast was exactly as it should be - the exterior crisp and the interior custard-while the sauce provided a pleasant balance of fruity notes and intrinsic sweetness that complimented rather than overwhelming the bread.At this point submitting to the fact that I was going to eat even the items I'd bought 'for later,' my next two tastes were a pair of $2.95 macarons that, much like the croissant, rivaled those both here and abroad in terms of taste and texture while opting for a much more rustic approach terms of size and presentation.  Beginning first with Pumpkin Spice and then proceeding to Vanilla with Dark Rum each palm-sized cookie was exactly what one would expect from a well trained pastry chef as the exterior shell provided a slight crackle on bite subsequently giving way to a soft meringue followed by dense cream that slowly dissipated on the tongue - the cinnamon and nutmeg notes of the former particularly notable while the rum in the second was appropriately understated thus serving to highlight the vanilla of the shell.If there were any 'misstep' on the morning, it *might* have been the "Summer Berry Croissant Bread Pudding," though when I say misstep I must temper the comment with the fact that my quibble is only that I prefer the French/English take on the dish while this one was more based on the French Custard style, a rich vanilla bean pudding without a lot of crunch or textural variance but instead laden with blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries plus a sidecar of lightly sugared strawberries.  Focusing more of the natural sweetness of the fruits and aromatics of the vanilla than the typical overly sweet versions served stateside it was more panna cotta than bread pudding to me, but chalking that up to personal tastes it was still delicious.Moving last to the one dish that gave me trepidation, the "French Napoleon" gave caused pause not only because the name clearly skewed towards a subset unfamiliar with a proper Mille-Feuille but also because so many pre-made versions of this layered pastry have failed to wow in the past...thankfully this was not the case at Essence.  Featuring light and crunchy layers of choux easily withstanding the tines of a fork without turning into a smooshy mess (see "Mille Feuille New York") intertwined with rich pastry cream speckled with dots of vanilla bean and ripe raspberries what truly made this version stand out was the manner in which Theodosopoulos caramelized each layer of choux, a technique reminiscent of Pierre Herme and as good as the French icon's version was I'd be hard pressed to say Essence's was any less impressive.  It would be awesome to see what they could do a la minut like Savoy, L'Arpege, or Genin and given the names I've dropped in the paragraphs above plus Essence's proximity I've no doubt I'll be returning to see what else the small shop is capable of soon.~~#~1
I'm on a community social action committee and have spent the last year planning a community-wide service day. We were each responsible to lead a team of volunteers in a different community service project and per my passion I chose the Humane Society. We arrived on Sunday afternoon with a group of 12 people at the Campus for Compassion on Dobbins Rd. Kathy - the head of volunteer services - met with us and gave us a thorough introduction. She included the history of the AZ humane society and the process and procedures by which they take-in and shelter animals. She really focused on promoting spaying and neutering pets and cited some very impressive statistics. Did you know that over 7 years un-neutered  cats can breed to reach 420,000 in numbers??!!!! and dogs 67,000??!!! thats CRAZY and so compelling. Kathy proceeded by giving us a very educational tour of the facilities... we saw dogs, horses, cats and bunnies. It was very eye-opening. First off it shattered any stigma you have about a shelter. The animal accommodations are so impressive!! The dogs have BIG size kennels with indoor and outdoor spaces that are really spacious. I was nervous to go in and see the dogs in kennels but I really wasn't as heartbroken as I thought I'd be bc they really had nice size spaces. There are sprawling lawns in the back where animals can run and play which even include a public dog park! There are also private puppy rooms.  The cats have big crates as well and even private bedrooms where they can hang out in groups and the facilities were squeaky clean w/o any odors. The volunteers were so nice, kind and devoted to the animals. We got to feed horses, play with cats and bunnies and put together leashes for dogs. The most encouraging thing though was that the place was busy on a sunday! buzzing with people wanting to adopt pets and several cats were actually adopted during the 2 hours we were there.It was a wonderful and meaningful experience and I encourage anyone who is looking for a pet to adopt from the Humane Society and to look into volunteering with them~~#~1
Every time I go in this place it's always a great experience.  My wife and I have been going to Lucille's pretty much every other Sunday for the last couple months.  Her favorite is the pulled pork mine is the Kansas City ribs, but we always have to start our meal off with the fried pickles.  If you're on a tight budget even buying one meal and sharing it is a definite option.  Sometimes I get full on the biscuits and spread the provide in the beginning.The bar area is a great place to have a meal and watch a game.  I would highly recommend this establishment to any of my friends.  But make sure you get the fried pickles... you will not be disappointed.Oh yeah.....please please please order the Mac 'N Cheese as your side.  You will thank me later.Q~~#~1
How very disappointing!  Nello's had a delightful menu with an array of salads, pizzas and sandwiches. Not Jac's. If the new restaurant wants to be a "pub", it should have a wider variety of selections. The menu was sad.Due to dietary restrictions, I asked for a plain garden salad. Lettuce, tomatoes and onions. And it wasn't very fresh either. Sad.Guess we'll be driving up north to Pima Crossing to visit Nello's.~~#~1
I highly reccomend this place. They helped my girlfriend and I figure out our taxes and deductions so that we could get the max refund. We both had been doing our taxes online and missing out on hundreds in deductions. Ill never use another online service to do my taxes again as long as these guys are here.~~#~1
Food is just ok, but the problem is it's way overpriced! I mean $9 for loco moco? Outrageous!~~#~0
My absolute favorite coffee shop - I'm a regular!Friendly atmosphere & staff, buttery fluffy muffins, ooey gooey danishes, tasty coffee, and support for local businesses and entrepreneurs.  The only negative for me is the mysterious disappearance of the corn tortilla bagel (much yummier than it sounds)!~~#~1
There's no business like show business. As any of my friends will tell you I am a theater junkie. I could sit in a theater all day, all week, all year long and do nothing but gaze at live performances of theatrical talent. lol! Well in actuality, hmmmmmmm I really could. I am not even joking on that. I probably would if someone brought me water every now and again. LOL!  Ok, seriously now, Childsplay is my favorite organization in Az for a host of reasons.    My dear friends of Childsplay know who they are. This is children's theater at it's best! The Q and A sessions after each show is a plus. The kids love it. I have to admit I do too since I get to go say hi to my friends after each stage-show. I also learn more techniques that I can steal when I teach drama to my inner city students. Teehee!  ( Yes I am a teacher and yes I would die to have some of their costumes and sets)    I have seen so many wonderful plays, literature remakes, and original scripts performed At TCPA and by Childsplay. Fernidad, BFG and New Kid were only some of the most amazing masterpieces I have had the distinct pleasure of viewing from these talented actors. Debbie, Scott, Katie, Jodi; well all of them! LOVE YOU!   Childsplay also has an artist in Residence program for schools. We have had an artist at our school for several years. It is wonderful to note that the teaching techniques classroom teachers are learning are helping tomorrows future. Time after time I have seen struggling kids blossom under their tutelage.     Of importance to note, TCPA is a beautiful facility. You can enjoy a nice venue along with the superstar talent. What more can you ask for?     The only negative I can possibly imagine is that in today's hard times the cost may be inhibiting to some families. But if you like them on Facebook they sometimes have discounted tickets and contests to win free tickets. A great way to start viewing them and get involved.    I do hope everyone continues to support the arts here in Az. As I have stated in my other "ARTS" reviews, I do worry about cultural program survival in Az with recent state budget cuts. Soooooooo, as a famous circus/rodeo person once said, "Go, On With The Show".~~#~1
Great donuts but horrible service... Didn't get anything we wanted due to a language barrier between us and the limited English speaking employee. She claimed, in broken English, to only speak Spanish. She understood ONLY the word "dozen" and we got a dozen of what ever she felt like giving us, then proceeded to ignore us while using her cell phone!Donut shops are a dime a dozen and we will never again return to Bosa.~~#~1
Great great food.  Best meal I had all week in Scottsdale.~~#~1
The felt that the food at Organ Stop was just So-So! Nothing special! The Music there is great! You defiantly go to Organ Stop for the Organ! Not the Pizza!~~#~0
I would suggest that anyone who lives here and has not been come, and if you're in town and looking for a great local non-chain restaurant that has quality food prepared the way it should, then try Cibo!  I took my man here for "mystery date night" as a surprise since he had never been.  No wait at 8:45 on a Friday night (yes! take that Pizzeria B) and the atmosphere of this house is super intimate and cool.  I love the atmosphere of the patio also, lit with those great off-white lights, and fire pits.  We shared the burrata which was gynormus, easily enough for 4 people or a hungry us.  The wine was tasty and reasonable.  I was drinking a pinot grigio, and my guy had the house chianti which I never usually order anywhere since it almost always reminds of grandmas table wine - until I tried Cibo's house version.  It was very good, definitely not from grandmas!   Now for the pizza - it is just perfection.  It has that amazing combination of char on the crust, crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside with the right balance of sauce and toppings.  It almost melts in your mouth, it's not heavy at all.  It's nice to go out for a pizza dinner with and app and dessert and not feel like you have to roll yourself out of the joint!  So we finished our romantic mystery date night with a crepe filled with nutella, ricotta, AND a scoop of ice cream on top.  I don't typically die over dessert, it's my boyfriends thing.  I'm an app girl - but this, it wasn't too sweet, it was so gooey and delicious and the ice cream added just the right amount of sweetness.  I would never eat here without dessert again!  I have been for lunch and they can get you in and out in a little less than an hour, but they don't fire up the pizza oven till supper which is why I prefer that here.  You will feel at home at this spot in a group or on a date - hell, maybe even a mystery one :)~~#~1
So far my restaurant experience in Phoenix has been subpar when it comes to service and this one took the cake. Everytime the server came to our table it was just to do one thing and we would be left in the lurch with our mouths silenced in the middle of asking for something. Finally the food came and it was actually quite delicious, I ordered the turkey eggs benedict with potatoes and fresh fruit. However once again the food was dropped off with no silverware, no condiments and no refills on the coffee. I truly hope the restaurant re-trains the staff or hires a whole new batch, because I am afraid food alone can not keep a business afloat.~~#~1
I went to Genghis Grill one evening while the Beijing Olympics were being aired. My experience eating here was probably a lot like Shawn Johnson's experience at the games -- not quite the showing I expected, but GG still managed to eek out a medal or two.My favorite Mongolian places include soup and salad bars in addition to the ingredients to be grilled; Genghis Grill does not. I missed being able to snack on a salad while waiting on my first bowl. The ingredients were all fine; most seemed fresh, but I had to avoid a couple of the less popular offereings (for the life of me, I don't understand why bok choy hasn't captured the hearts of the American public). The sauces were generally tasty...think Trader Joe's bottled dressings and you'll get the idea. The highlight of the night was when I realized the shredded cheese that given to me by request came free and clear. Of course, this made me wish I would have asked for sour cream, too. You won't see a picture of my experience at the Genghis Grill on a Wheaties box any time soon, but the meal was pleasant enough for a solid three stars.~~#~0
I've been visiting, and thinking, and visiting again, and thinking, and finally, after a long deliberation, I am ready to issue a verdict. Ruling: It's OK and a worthy stop in Scottsdale for a pre-dinner beverage. Sure, I could front load my review with spicy adjectives, overinflated superlatives, some forced humor, and throw on an added star and hope for a ROTD (come on, don't pretend that you don't know the formula), but I am not selling my stars for a day on the big screen. If it's been said once, twice, and even thrice, need I repeat it? Yes, because it is true -- this is not Postino, and for that matter, this is not Kaz. It is a good, local spot to grab a glass of wine, maybe even with your mom, who may not be hip enough to chill at Postino on Central (which really requires little hipness, I mean they let me in), or your dad, who may not be able to read in the dark at Kaz, or maybe for that friend from Gilbert, who you know, wants to walk the wide straight path of predictability. Predictability isn't bad...in this case, that means a good wine selection (could rotate more), full bar, usually one good draft or two out of 5, decent cocktails, and decent food. The food is not really what you come for. The bruschetta is sub par, but the salads are above par. And, I have to add, hummus with no flat bread or pita?? No. No pita for you! Service runs from friendly (read, management) to disillusioned and inattentive. The latter tends to happen if you sit outside. The last time I was in, I think grapes were crushed, olives were pressed, and chickpeas were ground...at least they could have been. Often they have live music too, which runs from the somewhat awkward jazz guy who keeps talking to you to the Motown wedding singer -- which on at least one occasion brought out near Elaine Benes-style dancing -- now that was worth the visit and waiting for the grape crushing.~~#~0
I am always comfortable in Michelina's, the service is excellent and they are not rushing you to "turn the table".  Michelina's cooking is fantastic!  Her daily specials are so inviting that I rarely order from the menu.  The drinks are excellent, bread just right, and the after dinner complimentary cordial is a nice finish.  One of the best kept secrets in Phoenix!~~#~1

I am a hot dog lover. For the past five years I've found no greater joy in Phoenix than hitting up Nogales Dogs for the best meal on the planet. Each evening when the Keyboard City on 20th St. and Indian School closes, the parking lot is converted into a quaint little dining atmosphere. I most enjoy going around six, the sun is setting and the buzz of traffic makes Phoenix seem more alive. This is my own preference and I know many people who hate going at this time because of the loud traffic. The bacon wrapped dogs are made to perfection with your choice of mayo, beans, tomatoes, onions, jalapenos, cheese, mushrooms, and lettuce. And to top it all off you can wash it down with a Mexican Coca Cola, mmm so sugar filled. Don't forget to bring cash and your appetite.~~#~1
Best Greek food I had in Arizona and excellent entertainment.The dolma's were the best I've had, their version of Babaganoush was very good and they had many lamb-based dishes.The entertainment was great. Live music, belly dancing, greek-style fun, broken plates, and dancing.Since I had the sampler plate I can tell you that if you're vegan, vegetarian or any other wacko thing like that, you might not enjoy the food here (Greek Lasagna?....really?) Also, the chicken was no good but I don't really like chicken anyway.~~#~1
Last night after developing a huge craving for Panang Chicken and browsing Yelp for a good place nearby, I decided to call Papaya. The guy who answered the phone said that due to a downed gas line in the area they couldn't operate, but their Mesa store would deliver to me for no extra charge since I couldn't come pick it up like I wanted to. I said this would be fine, placed my order, and the guy said it would be about 45 minutes. An hour and 15 minutes later the food still hadn't arrived, but I figured it was just because it was coming from Mesa. When it finally arrived, I was starving, so I opened the food immediately, only to find out that my Panang CHICKEN was nothing but sauce and a few carrots and bell peppers. On top of this, I had been charged a delivery fee when they said I wouldn't, and I was charged for chicken when I got none. I called back immediately to tell them my food did not have any chicken in it, but was only sauce and a couple vegetables. They informed me that they were very busy and would not be able to bring me another order that night, but I could call back the next day (today) and they would bring me another order. I was upset and hoped that for all the trouble the food was at least good. Well, it was. The panang sauce was very delicious and perfectly spicy. Although it was not made the way I ordered it, I could still tell that it was very good and I would definitely order it again. Today, I called back and they brought me a new order, this time of Spicy Eggplant with chicken since I had already had to eat the panang I ended up with last night and didn't want that again at this point. They were very nice about making it right, and they delivered it to me again at no charge and credited back the charge they made last night. Delivery took about an hour and 15 minutes again even though he had said 45 and this location is about a mile from where I live, so if you order delivery expect a bit of a wait. As for the Spicy Eggplant with chicken, it was REALLY delicious. The eggplant tasted like some of the best I've ever had, not mushy but not firm, and I finally got my chicken and yes, it was very good. SO in conclusion, the food is great but I hope that they are more organized when they aren't having technical difficulties. Probably won't have them deliver again but I would definitely order from here again. If there hadn't been all the problems I would give them 4 stars but the fact that I couldn't even get my order corrected that night was upsetting.~~#~0
Clean, organized, and well-stocked (for the most part), Fujiya's carries my favorite car freshener, chips, bread, and iced coffee (in a can) among many other good things. Reasonably priced and extremely courteous customer service, I am always happy to shop there. The bentos, I wish, are kept in warmers like Suruki in San Mateo, CA, but Fujiya has an area adjacent to the register which includes a microwave to heat your purchased bento, so you can sit and eat and relax after shopping. What I love so much about their service is that I can place my order ahead of time and they'll have it available and ready. I think this is the only Japanese store that has just about everything I need to stock my pantry. It's no wonder I've been coming here year after year.~~#~1
Sorry Banana Leaf... I'm usually not picky at all but the Thai Curry Tofu and Vegetable dish I picked up last night was awful.  Really... it was almost not edible.  The packaging was not great, so it kind of spilled a bit in the bag - not a good start.Perhaps the curry is the 'yellow curry' that Jenny R refers to in her review - maybe the chef should taste it before serving it - it was nasty!Seriously, I've had better Asian food from the food court at the mall before!I will say, you did listen to my request to add eggplant to the dish - thank you... but if someone requests eggplant, perhaps you should make sure it's cooked fully next time.  I had a bite that was barely cooked - it was crunchy.  So, needless to say - I don't think I'll be giving you another shot.  First impressions sometimes last a lifetime.  Sorry Banana Leaf!~~#~1
I would absolutely not recommend living here. I lived at these apartments for a year, and wow was the management staff a MESS. When I moved in, my mailbox was broken so I couldn't get mail for a week. They didn't give me a pool key, they gave me the wrong apartment keys, they would mix up all my information, and they just weren't very nice. I can't remember how many times they lost my work orders so I'd have to call and call to make sure things got fixed in my apartment! The neighbors were loud--I had to call the police maybe four times because they wouldn't turn down their music and I had to study for school and finals, and random people came banging on the door looking for some girl who had obviously p'd them off. The police came to my house in the middle of the night looking for her, too. One time, they gave my garage to somebody else even though I was still paying for it and when my husband came home in the evening with his pick-up full of expensive equipment, we had to wait for the cops to come and figure out whose car it was who was parked in our garage! it was a total nightmare. Shortly before I moved out new staff came in and they seemed somewhat better organized. But---I wouldn't take the chance. For the same price, you can definitely find somewhere better to live.~~#~1
What a great find! Located off of Yelp after a business meeting in the area & we were hungry before we hit the road. Very comfortable space, lighting is good so you can see each other & your food which is not always the case. The decor is not overwhelming but extremely comfortable, some TV's, Thai decor & more pop music on the overhead. The staff was extremely attentive from the moment we walked in through out the meal. My Jasmin iced tea never got to the bottom. The menu has great variety. The pad Thai was excellent as were the vegetarian rolls. The Tom Ka soup was excellent. Every member of our group got something different and they were all extremely happy. We will be back. Pricing was very reasonable. There is patio seating available. Check it out.~~#~1
Today was the fist time I have been to Chino Bandito. My friend has been there several times and loves this place. After having a few beers, we were pretty hungry and decited to go here. This place is mixed in a sort of industrial corner behind a Walgreens and a transmission shop. Walking in you will notice how big this place is inside. Customer service was excellent. The counter person was great in explaining the different options on the menu which is a mix of Mexican food and Chinese food. Great concept for something different. For ten dollars I had the Carnitas burrito and a Jerk chicken burrito with Jerk fried rice and black beans and a large iced tea (all you can drink). It also comes with a Snikerdoodle cookie. Wait time was minimal and the food was brought very quickly to our table. I really enjoyed the items that I had order and I found the carnitas had the right flavor and tenderness in a burrito (you can also get it in a bowl). The Jerk chicken burrito had some zing to it. Enough to make me sweat a little. One thing that I noticed was that the employee's were really good about keeping the place clean. Sweeping, cleaning the tables, wiping up around the drink dispensers. I also noticed that they wrap all of the highchair trays in plastic to keep the clean and dust free.One last thing, they have free wifi!~~#~1
Too long.......it took me way too long to make it to Sens. Sens is what we need more of in Phoenix!Seated promptly on a Friday night by Johnny Chu himself, Johnny Chu really has put together a winner here, Johnny Chu.....alright, I admit it...I like saying his name!The Asian tapas idea is new to me, having dined at some great Tapas places from Chicago to Vegas,  but alas never an Asian tapas joint. I must say no Spanish tapas place ever made me feel like Sens did (except the time I drank a pitcher of Sangria)!The Tofu dishes are amazing. How do you learn to love Okra? Get it at Sens. The Hong Kong rice noodles were not what I was expecting so I was a little taken back by them looking like a plateful of water chestnuts. One taste was all that was needed to cure my trepidations about the flavor - fantastic!I will be back to Sens Tapas & Sake Bar soon - do you think you could invent an "Asian Sangria"? C'mon Johnny, I know you can do it!~~#~1
Being the B, L, and D (breakfast, lunch and dinner) restaurant of a major valley resort takes allot of versatility. From scrambling eggs to grilling a piece of meat the new Rico's American Grill at the Point Hilton Squaw Peak Resort shows that all this can be done and more on a daily basis. With two massive patios, a large bar and lounge area coupled with a fantastic selection of locally made beers on tap, just beckons you to try them all out. This is easily done by ordering up a Beer Flight ($7) which gets you 4 5oz glasses of their best brews, though this will be tough to chose, they're all good. Then you can order a capped 64oz growler ($20) to go! A growler is simply a large glass jug filled with your favorite beer, your choice. These are all the rage in other cities so I was excited to see Rico's making this offer. Id fill it with my latest favorite, Left Hand Milk Stout Sweet Stout. Think rich flavors of chocolate and coffee blended with milk sugars to give a sweet and creamy taste. In the large dining room you'll notice a wood fired oven. Unfortunately Rico's doesn't take full advantage of this, only offering a handful of menu items cooked in it including the BBQ Chicken Flatbread ($12). Covered with pulled chicken, red onions, Rico's BBQ sauce and mozzarella, this paired well with our beers though could have used a bit more salt, easily remedied. Another glimmer of what could be was the Wood Oven Baked Penne ($13). Several large meatballs, roasted tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella and pesto ricotta cheese and al dente pasta made for a hearty satisfying meal. A bit lighter but bold with flavor, the Chopped Salad ($10, add grilled chicken $3) made with grilled corn, black beans, bacon, tomatoes, cucumber, avocado, and BBQ-ranch dressing was shaken, not stirred, literally. The salad is brought out in a large martini shaker, dressing added on the spot then shaken well. Kind of a neat twist on table-side salad service, what's old is new again. The Wicked Meatloaf ($15) could have used some of Rico's BBQ sauce for a sweet contrast instead of the semi-boring-more-like-brown-gravy cracked pepper demi. The meaty slabs were paired up with roasted garlic mashed potatoes that were well seasoned and comforting.   Perfectly cooked and perfectly tender, the New York Strip Steak ($21) had a warm poblano and bacon relish that I could have eaten by the spoonful. The smoky sweet relish made the need for any sort of steak sauce not necessary. Along side was a heaping helping of green chile mac 'n' cheese, so creamy and so gone, delish. Apple Skillet For 2 ($7) takes apple slices simmered in a brown sugar and cinnamon, thanks to the wood-burning oven, then topped with cake crumbles and served with cinnamon vanilla gelato. If the skillet weren't so hot I would have licked it clean. While Rico's may not have yet achieved culinary greatness, what you do get is solid Southwestern influenced American grub.~~#~0
Great home made taste on the meatballs.  Also they have diet coke.  Shop was nice and clean.  Friendly and fast service~~#~1
I had received an email from a student retention telling me that I still owe money for the time that I had taken classes (two weeks) although these fools canceled my financial aid. I will sue this school if they even attempt to collect money from me and I have withdrawn from the classes on the right time, but this rep. told me that the withdrawal period was Jan. 11.~~#~1
What can I say except that Jodi is incredible. I had purchased an online deal because I've always wanted to do something like this and thought it to be a great gift for my other half. I sent her a message and she quickly responded. Almost everything I needed to know for the shoot was emailed to me. You have the opportunity to do your own hair and makeup or have someone she works with do it at a reasonable rate. I highly recommend that you get it done by her ladies. That day I saw Erica. She was really fun and got me into the mood (the glass of wine helped too :-) ) and she did an incredible job with the makeup and hair. For those who feel a little nervous I do recommend bringing some wine along with you. It really loosens you up a bit and allows you to be more comfortable. It was perfect since my first photos were the nude shots. Note: wear loose fitting clothing, nothing elastic and be sure that you do not have a sunburn on your body. Let your hair air dry and it is OK to put on your own serums and moisturizers prior to the shoot. Make sure nothing with sunscreen gets on your face and while it's not necessary, I made sure to use a primer. I thought it really helped out with how my makeup set. Be prepared to pose in positions that may be a bit awkward and also note that you will likely be sore the next day from the different twisting that you have to do. Jodi really knows how to make you feel comfortable and at ease. I don't make a habit of being in the buff in front of complete strangers and for me to drop my robe without feeling shy was a big deal for me. It helped that I had my own music mix on my iPod throughout the entire shoot as well. The overall whole experience was incredible. I felt sexy and confident. I went back with my honey to look at the photos. He really really liked them and had a hard time choosing which he wanted to go into the album. I can't wait to see everything finished. I can't wait to do it again :) Thank you Jodi for making it such a memorable experience. I highly recommend her and her ladies!!!~~#~1
The best burgers in Phoenix. The owners are great and am on a first name basis. Forget about fast food and support this local business. Go double.Add bacon.Park at Circle K if in a hurry.Plan on holding it until you get home.Stick to the burger and fries, genius.~~#~1
I'm sorry to be what seems to be the lone one star review.  Either I got there on the worst day in their history, or everyone drank the Koolaid, or I just have different expectations and taste buds.It seems like a great idea.  It's a build your own burger joint, $7.00 gets you a cooked to order burger with one cheese, up to 4 toppings, and 2 sauces with fries or onion rings-or some other choices.  They also claim that the beef is local, hormone free, etcetera....I chose a rare burger with American, grilled onions, sauteed mushrooms. tomato and lettuce, with mayo and mustard on a potato bun.  I added bacon for a dollar.First, let me point out that if you are in a hurry, DON'T GO HERE TO EAT.  I waited exactly 39 minutes for my food. This would not be a big deal if:1.  I had been warned before they ran my credit card--what if I only had 30 minutes for lunch??2. They had places to sit but it's tiny and full.3.  They had magazines, a jukebox, ANYTHING to entertain you for 39 minutes.  You can't even get your drink early to sip on that.At the 30 minute mark, I'm ready to eat cardboard with a little ketchup on it, so maybe they make you wait so everything tastes even better?Anyway, before my burger comes up, I notice that the lady behind the counter is saying that the orders overwhelmed the kitchen.  I look in the kitchen---they have ONE GUY TRYING TO DO ALL THIS??????   He'd better be getting a share of the profits!!!!!  Now I'm jsut feeling really bad for this guy back there.I finally get my burger!  YAY!!  I'm SO excited!  All those 4 and 5 star reviews!  I take a bite and....the patty shoots out the other side of the bun like it had been shot out of a cannon.WTH?  I look at the patty.  It's clean as a whistle. I mean there is no mayo or mustard or cheese smeared on the patty.  I turn it over and it slides out of my fingers back into the basket.  The other side is clean too.  The freakin' burger was so greasy, it slid all over the place!  Then a greasy glop of what must have  been the mushrooms and onions slid out.  Still not seeing any cheese, mayo, or mustard anywhere.  Just oil.  Tons and tons of oil.  I open the bun,  On one side is a heavily oiled slick of lettuce glued to the bun by (I am guessing) a slice of cheese.  The other side of the bun has some mayo and mustard residue--and more oil.  I'm grossed out, but hungry.  I take a bite.  It's not rare,  It's well done and oddly, tastes very faintly of liver.  BTW, remember the bacon I paid a dollar for?  Not there.  I'm really puzzled that instead of cheese. or beef, or SOMETHING, I just taste that faint livery taste. So I take another bite.There isn't even any salt or pepper, or anything on the burger patty.  This is perhaps, the worst grade of meat available for human consumption.  I take a third bite because that second bite brought back a memory of when I worked for a meat company here in town.  Now I recognize the flavor.  I'm not saying that what I ate that day at Two Hippies was old dairy cow, but that's EXACTLY what it tasted like.At this point, I turn to the fries.  The are shriveled and DARK and taste like they've been fried and then microwaved.I couldn't get out of there fast enough!  Forget my danged dollar!  just get me in the car!Exactly one hour and 20 minutes later, I had vicious diarrheaI haven't had that trouble even with eating junk food at the fair!No.  NO.  A thousand times NO!Red Robin is my next burger stop.  Period~~#~1
So, for my date tonight to the Compass Room, I needed to get my nails done.  I removed my acrylics myself last week.  I read the reviews here and decided to try DV.You know, sometimes when you walk into a nail shop for the first time, it's almost like the Soup Nazi.  Not this place!There were two girls ahead of me, so I waited a bit, but only about ten minutes.  It's bigger than the place I had been going to!  Really clean and I heard ENGLISH being spoken by the nail techs!  That was nice.  Yeah, there were still speaking Vietnamese (or so I think) to each other, yes, probably about us gringas, but it was refreshing to hear actualy conversations.I had Le.  She was so sweet!  I told her all about my date, too.She was quick, and made some suggestions about what to get.  Usually I like clear tips that they have to paint.  I was kinda short on time, so I went with her suggestion of white tips.  Plus, it was about $5 cheaper.She was quick but *really* methodical.  I think this may be the nicest set of acrylics I've gotten out here in the PHX!She even called me by name throughout the conversation.$25 for a new full set.  Not bad at all~~#~1
Feeling yucky one day and wanting nothing but some reminders of my bay area asian food... My search began with my iPhone for Pho.. AND I wanted good Pho.. (Im skeptical of some dishes in the desert, just sayin'!).. I drove a good 20min from my loft to find this place.. worth it. Usual toppings you will find with real Vietnamese Pho.. but awesome! I asked for a variety of tofu and seafood.. I couldnt finish it all.. but never can with Pho.. its a big bowl, and filling! Extras on tables to get your Pho on.. Ordered the Vietnamese Shrimp Rolls too.. left feeling not so stuffy! AND full.. OH yeah, and I still had money for a bit of shoe shopping the next day... :-)~~#~1
My wife's work had their Christmas party here last night. Although the customer service was slow and average at best, the food was outstanding. I had a burger and my wife the steak salad. I was the DD, but my wife said the margaritas were excellent. Dessert was tiramisu and sweet potato cheesecake. Great little place with a nice vibrant ambiance.~~#~1
Ok, so I have to share my morning experience. But first I must start off by saying this: I'm no moron. Honest. So, this morning I stopped for gas. My tank was getting dangerously low and there was no way I'd make it to work. That's okay, for I allotted time this morning for re-filling my tank. From my casa, I turned East on Indian School, vaguely remembering there's a Quick Trip nearby. Perfect. I had stopped there before. But it wasn't a Quick Trip I saw at the corner of Central and Indian School. Not wanting to risk running out of gas, I opted to stop here, at this ampm station. I pulled up to the closest gas tank, got out of my car, took off my gas cap and reached for the gas nozzle. Only then I discovered there was no pay-at-the-pump option. The short notice on the pump said to select my grade and start filling. "Wow," I thought, "It's so odd for a station to trust people - especially in this area - to not drive off without paying." So, I followed the instructions, but nothing happened. I kept hitting the grade button. It kept beeping back at me. Still nothing. To top it off (no pun intended), the nozzle was wrapped in this huge rubber tube thing that compressed when I applied pressure to the handle. I had never seen anything like it. Thinking my particular pump was fuct up, I pulled my car up to the next one. That's when I saw it - this strange machine, like an Amtrack ticket dispenser. I approached with curiously. That's when I realized. You swipe your card at this central machine (or deposit cash, if that's your preference) and then go back to your pump. Ah-ha. This is how this station works. So, I did just that. I punched in my gas pump number (4) and went back to my car to re-fill the tank. Already annoyed at this point, I figured I'd pump enough gas to get me through the next couple of days. Only, it wasn't pumping. The long rubber thingy was hindering my ability to hook the nozzle up to my gas tank. UGH. So, that's when I flexed my muscles and applied enough pressure to squeeze out $12 worth of gas. Then I re-hooked the nozzle on its perch and walked back to the strange machine for my receipt - it told me to do so when I swiped my card. Only, no receipt came out. I punched the keypad with defiance and walked off. Stupid ampm station. Since when does any gas station benefit from being different? I'm so used to pay-at-the-pump; you just swipe your card, select your grade, pump your gas, grab your receipt and go. Quick Trip doesn't torment me like this. There is no rubber nozzle thingy in my way. Grr. Screw this. I'm never going back there again.

This place is great to go in and have a look at the plethora of neat toys and candy they have... but that's about it. The prices are way too high and a lot of the items aren't things you can't get anywhere else. They also have a real lack of imported candies/chocolate which is something I would drop more money for. Be prepared to buy more than you wanted if you only have plastic - they have a minimum of $6 to use your card so I had to buy two sodas I didn't want in order to get my handful of candy. With all that said, this is a really nice, unique local business and I love the idea behind it, but I don't have a lot of free cash to spend on a bag of gummy bears I can buy at Circle K for $2 less. This is definitely a place for gifting only and not just when you want something sweet to eat.~~#~0
Sauce is my kind of place.  Great, inexpensive food, casual yet trendy atmosphere, perfect location.  Located right by Urban Outfitters and Olive and Ivy at the Scottsdale Waterfront, I like Sauce as a pre or post shopping bonanza meal.  I always have the same thing: the mozzarella and tomato salad (which you should know is mostly greens with chucks of each, drizzled in balsamic), and the artichoke and portabella pizza.  This is a huge meal so I always have leftovers which make for the perfect 2am after-bar treat.  If youre feeling particularly saucey, you can have yourself a glass of wine as well.~~#~1
Wow. Worst food poisoning of my life. Ate here Saturday night for my birthday. Started to just not feel right about 20 minutes afterward. Sunday I never left the bed except to go be sick. I lost a full FIVE pounds in one day. Stay away from the salmon. I for one will never go back. I'm really sad too because I decided on it from the reviews. Another reviewer said they were disappointed in the recent quality. I should have listened!!~~#~1
Loved it! Best French toast ever!~~#~1
I used Harvil's Auto Body after a fender bender. They were one of the auto body places that was included in State Farm's program. They were efficient, friendly, proactive, highly-responsive, and helpful. I especially appreciated that they kept me updated on the progress of my automobile and advocated for me/my vehicle when needed. This level of high-quality customer services is hard to come by. If you have a choice, choose Harvil's. You won't be disappointed.~~#~1
Came for the beer, stayed for the scenery.~~#~1
Two stars because there isnt a drive thru.. and Im a lazy American who forgot that when you live abroad you walk for coffee and your needs.. Three stars because the peeps working are as friendly as it gets.. but the sugar/condiment bar is dirty.. clean it up Starbucks!~~#~0
Great subs, the Club Supreme mike's style was really good~~#~1
Not bad, but not my first choice for the area. The staff are friendly and the food is good, but it just feels too much like a man's club. That being said, it is a great place for guys to go for dinner who are really looking for dinner. I think I need more... of something.~~#~0
Great atmosphere, friendly staff, and good food.  Dined with a large group so we had a set menu. I requested no butter with my crab stuffed chicken breast but they served it on the side just in case I felt the chicken was too dry.  It was de-lish!~~#~0
This is a car wash that I would highly recommend. They do a great job, and pay attention to the details. It costs a little more at Hot Shots, but it's worth it. It takes a bit more time, too- but worth it. The main reason I would recommend this place- they do an outstanding job and are consistent every time.~~#~1
Nadya is one of the nicest people you will ever meet.  Part of her personality is what kept me coming back.Recently she altered a bridesmaids dress for my girlfriend and did a terrific job.  Flawless.  In years past, she has altered all of my "work attire."  I have since moved, but whenever I return home, if I ever need any work done I will bring it with.Nadya, you are a wonderful person, and any recommendation I can send your way I will!~~#~1
Taylor's has such a refreshing cafe menu. I've been for breakfast far more often than lunch. I hope to try dinner soon b/c I think they feature live jazz on Wednesday nights. I've never ever had a bad meal. In fact, I always have a hard time deciding. Some highlights in my opinion are the huevos rancheros, eggs Benedict (with a choice of meat), waffles & the Mexican omelet. I never liked Bloody Marys until I had one at Taylor's! I tried a friend's once and have been hooked ever since! But if you want a less intoxicating beverage, try the iced chai latte. Careful, its so good you'll be ordering another before you know it! Bon Appetite!~~#~1
It was ok, there was a large group of us and we all enjoyed the appitizers, including the table side guac.  Biggest complaint was how poorly their bar was stocked.  No Chivas, no Sambuca, weak margaritas, etc.  So while the service was good, the food was just ok and the bar needs to be stocked better.  There is room for improvement.~~#~0
LOVED THE SWITCH WITH JENNIFER ANISTON what is wrong with filmcritics today????~~#~1
In the office, Fiesta Burrito is aptly known as "across the street."  Kind of like, "How about across the street?"  "Yeah, I could do across the street, today."  If I ever said, "How about Fiesta Burrito?"  I would get, "Where's that?"  Then I would have to say, "You know, across the street."  And the response would be, "Well, why didn't you say so in the first place."The primary reason we eat at "across the street" is because it is convenient - it's across the street.  And in the immortal words of my most quotable co-worker, "It is fast, cheap, and good -- no questions asked."  The part about it being good is debatable.  I could do with a little less greasy.  Fast, no question.  And despite that fact that "across the street" charges 60 cents for spicy carrots now, the prices are low.  I like the chorizo plate with a side of sour cream, although I might start branching out as we eat at "across the street" way too much, and I'm getting tired of always having the same thing.At just above a dive, I would call it a hole in the wall, but really, it is just a generic Mexican joint that hides in plain sight.  Even the name is rather plain as no one can seem to remember it.  There is a smallish, generic inside dining area, which is accompanied by a small, generic patio for outside dining.  Some high school students seem to come by for lunch leave.  The staff is polite.  Until they move or I no longer work across the street, I'll be a regular.~~#~0
For so many reasons, Costco is top notch but I'm going to review their Opto department. They are equally as stellar! Dr. Tieu is super friendly, knowledgeable and very approachable. The retail part has the best pricing on contacts, frames and lenses compared to any competitor. Lucky me they take my insurance and my yearly supply of contacts came to a big fat $0 after rebates. Always ask about rebates for contacts, both the Dr office and the retail desk will usually have some that you can combine!~~#~1
Horrible experience. We had a home emergency which forced us to move out for 15 days. We referred to them by a friend. We explained to them we're Seniors on limited income but assured them they'd be paid in full. We paid the medical and our insurance co verbally told them that once the bill was submitted they would be paid.  But, No, No, NO!!!!  "Not our policy"  They were holding our two kids for ransom!!!Horrible, uncaring staff to deal with.~~#~1
The place isn't have bad.  I got a sweet and sour lunch combo, and it came out fine.  Their menus pretty thurough, and prices are really fair.  Its chinese food, and if your in the area, it should get you where you need to go.Place is clean, staff is friendly.  Would return for lunch here again soon.~~#~0
This place is the classic bait and switch joint.  I ordered through the drive-thru and told the person I was ordering that I had a coupon for a "buy one-get one free" Chicken Tender Sandwich,  The bun was hard and not at all like the picture on the coupon. The two small tenders were extremely rubbery and looked like they had been retrieved from the trash can after they had been tossed for being under a heat lamp too long. The lettuce was the part that most people toss when cleaning and the tomatoes were thin and pale and looked like they had been genetically mutated . . .uhh, I mean grown.  This wasn't the first time the server manager did this to me. I should have known better. I used a coupon a while back there for a buy one, get one free breakfast burrito and asked that they prepare it to look like the picture that appeared on the coupon. My bad!  When I got down the road and reached into the bag to take a bite, the cook had apparently taken an onion and diced it up super fine and threw that in with it.  If you want a decent hamburger or chicken sandwich without attitude and that looks as advertised or better, go to smash burger. As for this place, never, never  again.  The only good Carl's Jr. I have found in the valley so far is off the Superstition (Hwy 60) and Tomahawk.  From the Manager down, they strive to live up to their advertising.~~#~1
Great posole - and the kids love their bean and cheese burritos. That's all we have eaten no need to venture further on the menu. Great hangover food. The staff is always very friendly!~~#~1
I have heard so many good reviews for this place, so who wouldn't try it? I should have taken the hints before I got my meal, that this wasn't a good choice.Hint 1: Location - It's right next to a smoke shop and a gas station across the street from a mobile park.Hint 2: Food test - It was nice that I got to sample the food even if the first sample wasn't up to par, the guy wouldn't leave me alone about sampling.Hint 3: Decor - I know this should never have anything to do with the food, but it felt like I was eating at a cousins house on the bad side of town, wobbly chairs, wobbly table.I ordered the teriyaki chicken (didn't think it would be bad, I mean who can mess up teriyaki?) With chicken fried rice (once again, how on earth can you mess up fried rice?) The chicken tasted like it was frozen and thawed out all day. Such a horrible taste. The fried rice tasted like it too was thawed out, kind of had a gross tangy after taste. There also wasn't any spices or egg in the fried rice, just a bunch of green onion,which technically isn't a fried rice. This meal can be related to something you get in the frozen section at a grocery store.They also give you a snickerdoodle cookie, that looked like it could be the best thing on the menu, until I noticed it wasn't cooked all the way through.But the icing on the cake was the gross pube like grey hair I found floating in my teriyaki sauce. So the expensive $8 meal was so not worth it, and I 'm sure when Diners Drive Ins and Dives visited, the food was great, but today it was the grossest thing I've ever had.~~#~1
Not good. And it's not been for a couple of years. There are advantages: good location, rarely busy, good for larger groups. But last few times we've been there have experienced average food and lousy service.  When joining my already seated group on Saturday (3/28) the high-school hostess wagged her finger in my face like an East German border guard, the waffle house waitress poked me in the shoulder to get my attention and the wife's chicken dish had to be sent back as there were only 2 measly pieces of chicken in it.  Only 2 beers on tap. Garbage.~~#~1
Put it this way: Every guest I have in Phoenix, I force to get the Monte Cristo at Morning Glory. It is just that good.~~#~1
My fear and avoidance of the dentist has been building for years. However, I simply couldn't put it off any longer. With trepidation I scheduled an appointment at Downtown Dental and promptly received an email back with available times. I went in not knowing what to expect. Not only had the staff already found my insurance information they made a point to call me by the name I go by rather than my formal name and that put me at ease. I sat down with Heather, the hygienist and she was so warm and friendly that I instantly felt fine confessing to her my fear of the dentist. She allayed my concerns and told me not to worry. There was no guilt trip for not flossing or drinking too much soda, which is always annoying. Then the scary part... the dental work. It was uncomfortable and I hated it, but soon it was over, it wasn't that bad and I felt a thousand times better. Dr. Berschler came over and examined me and pointed out a few cavities we needed to take care of. Then the even scarier part (or so I anticipated)...the price! But I was pleasantly pleased and relieved that the total cost after insurance was literally thousands less than I'd been quoted by a dentist a year ago to take care of my problems. In fact the total cost is very reasonable; this isn't a dentist looking to take advantage of you. I couldn't have been more pleased and delighted at the friendliness and helpfulness of everyone in the office. The convenient downtown location only makes it better. I will never go to another dentist again and I'm actually looking forward to my next appointment. I can't recommend this office enough.~~#~1
This review if for their happy hour because that's all that I've experienced.  Love that they have happy hour all night on Sundays and Mondays.  I live close by and used to frequent Wildfish often for happy hour.  I usually get the crab cake and lobster bisque.~~#~1
Good food~~#~1
4 star service 2 star food = 3 stars.The bfast potatoes were undercooked and obviously microwaved, not grilled.The bacon was just OK.The prices are HIGH, both for the menu & the grocery.Wi-fi is unreliable.  When it goes out, it takes them 15-20 min to reset it.Great friendly service.  Nice, sunny outdoor seating.~~#~0
Sometimes you just want to give an A for effort...Or maybe more than three lame stars.  As the two other previous reviewers have pointed out succinctly, the man who I assume to be the owner was extremely nice.  I made the 1.5 hour drive from Tucson to watch Avatar at Arizona Mills, and my friends and I decided to grab a bite before heading back.  We randomly drove down Baseline and pretty much stumbled upon this place.  Traffic going westbound towards the 10 was insane.  I mean it was bumper to bumper past Rural.  Anyway, I ask the guy who I assume is the owner why the traffic was so bad.  At first he didn't know, but then realized that the 60 was closed.  He politely recommended that we head south then cut across to get back to the 10.  I ordered the Jerusalem Falafel sandwich. It was pretty good.  Though, in all honesty, falafel is not one those kind of dishes that one can gush over.  In my opinion, it's pretty hard to mess up deep frying ground chickpeas.  I ought to point out that the ingredients were very fresh.  This also applied to the side salad that comes with the combo meal.  My two friends opted for the gyros, and it looked good.  The meat was thinly sliced, which is somewhat different than others I've had.  They seemed to enjoy the meal, but I don't think they were quite overwhelmed by it either.  In fact, we didn't mention anything about the food during the hour and a half trip back home.  The food is by no means bad at Pita Shack.  It's adequate to serviceable in terms of Mediterranean food.  The positives regarding the food have to be its freshness and price.  In fact, I spent no more than $8 for a sandwich, salad, and drink.  The service, as noted previously, is undoubtedly the most shining spot of the place.   As we were finishing up our meal, the guy who I assume is the owner offered us lentil soup on the house.  We declined after being quite filled and satisfied from our respective sandwiches.  I believe another reviewer had the same thing happen to him, and he had positive comments about it.  Now, for me it's was the food that really matters.  Accordingly, I gave three stars, as opposed to the four that I was close to giving.  Should I ever return to the Tempe area hankering for food in a pita, I would most definitely give Pita Shack another shot; if only to support a genuinely nice guy's business.~~#~0
Let me tell you about my first crush in Phoenix. It happened to me when I least expected. I was sitting at my small cubicle during my first job. Birthday cake graced the break room practically everyday but today was different. When I walked inside to sing an out of key version of the birthday song to my coworker, I noticed a masterpiece in front of my eyes. A white cake topped with the freshest of fruit and the creamiest of white chocolate morphed into a piece of artwork. One bite into the white cake filled with fresh strawberries and I was in lust. It later turned into love and I've been happy every since. I silently thank the coworker who introduced me to Honey Moon Sweets because I can't imagine life without knowing about this sweet Phoenix treat. Over the years, Honey Moon Sweets has been my go-to bakery for a special occasion. I've purchased the "basic" cake for birthday parties. Let me just note here that a basic cake from Honey Moon Sweets is practically a masterpiece in any other bakery's mind. When planning my sister's baby shower, I knew exactly where to go. I wanted the perfect cake and a work of art to grace the baby shower table. And behold the Honey Moon Sweets baby cake. It was three tiers, blue with rattles, pacifier, building blocks, a crib, a teddy bear...you name it filling the top. Some of the pieces were frosting creations and some were real toys. It was almost too gorgeous to eat, but we couldn't resist it so enjoyed every bite. It was just as good as it looked if not better. Honey Moon Sweets does a fabulous job of using the freshest of ingredients and you can tell upon the first bite. The scariest part of this cake adventure was the travel time from the bakery to the Biltmore for the baby shower. One wrong move and the cake would have been toast so be prepared to move lightly with this cake in hand. As you can imagine, cakes from Honey Moon Sweets are not budget-friendly, but for what you get from the cake, it's reasonably priced. Just save your coins for a special occasion because it's worth it. I promise.~~#~1
It's unfair to review this mall on what it was - since it no longer is (and what it is isn't as good as what it was). It's also unfair to review this on what it will be - since it isn't that yet. Today, it's a mall I rarely visit. Apart from a few stores I would visit out of convenience or necessity, there's not much to offer compared to what it used to have. The fantastic movie theater, Jutenhoops, Alpine Ski Keller, Bear Cover, and even Ed Debevics are all long gone... oops, there I go bringing up the past. Seriously though, these were painful to lose - one by one.So today, there's a Linens 'n' Things which is hardly unique, and a Trader Joe's which is nice to have in the area, and also a Sister's Attic and Closet upscale thrift stores which add a bit of much-needed flavor. The Chili's, the Bookstar, and Black Angus are still around. So is the jewelry store that has never really offered a compelling reason to enter. They've wedged an LA Fitness here and they've also added a Blimpie and an Arby's... all very healthy choices. Besides all of the generic shops and eateries and standard offerings, there's still a few unique experiences - though nothing like it used to... shit, there I go again. Anyway, so there's a few places that aren't screaming "standard mall" such as Pita Grill, a pipe and tobacco shoppe (you have to spell it that way in this case), a place to get eyewear, and some other small and uninteresting businesses. In that sense, I suppose this is has become a decent and convenient neighborhood strip mall. This is a shame really since it's lacking most of the key elements that made it really special. It's still a beautiful outdoor mall and the architecture alone makes it a unique alternative to the cookie-cutter malls that strategically litter the landscape of America. I'm worried about what they'll do to the architecture when they renovate this place someday, but I think the fact that this mall isn't terribly interesting anymore in general means it won't be so terribly missed when they lose that last remaining bit of "special."~~#~0
Food is outstanding! Rebecca rocks!!!!!!~~#~1
Came here for lunch for the 1st time...and the line was long.  Was briefed by the server...p/u your sides...pick your meat...tell them how much weight of meat you want...also get unlimited slices of bread (white/wheat).  Boom you got your meal.  So I figured...instead of getting the sandwich...I can just make my own with the bread they gave me.   Liked how they weighed all the meat before you.  1/2lb of brisket didn't seem like a lot in my basket...but seemed liked what everybody was getting in around me. So figured that was enough and if you eat it with their bread it'll fill you up.  Lean Brisket taste good...sauce was good...nothing that wowed me.  Wouldn't drive out of my way to get here.  Average BBQ joint.~~#~0
I'm sure most people don't go to a fancy steak restaurant for the Mac 'n cheese, but as a mac aficionado, it's practically my duty. And the mac here, well it's high quality. I like to order the lobster mac sans lobster (not a big fan of seafood), which without the seafood, is actually quite inexpensive. Now be warned, this is real heavy mac 'n cheese. It's so cheesy, and thick, and delicious; don't plan on being able to wiggle out of your booth any time soon after eating it.~~#~1
FEZ should stand for Fabulous Exotic ZExperience. I was planning on making it here for ages but couldnt until I found out the new metro rail is ride outside!! I needed a quiet place to read and was much obliged when they turned off all music by my request.  I was able to read my Nancy Bartholomew novles with great intensity. The staff left me alone for hours and the intoxicating rosemary smell really opened my buds. The atmosphere is definatly trendy, After I finnaly soaked it all in, I would def give this place 5 stars although I didnt try the food or bar.~~#~1
Better than Starbucks anyday! The staff encourage their customers to get creative and provide new drink suggests to add to their list such as "The Annihilator"..My personal Favorite: "The Cookie with a little raspberry"~~#~1
Get ready to get meat drunk, then fall into a meat coma!! Although this is not a nationwide chain, this is what a chain restaurant can and should be, it's great. You begin with an immaculate salad bar. Definitely the best one I have ever seen or tasted for that matter. Hell you have to love a salad bar that has a whole wheel of Parmesan cheese for you to enjoy. Enough with the salad lets talk about the star of the show, the meat!! Transcendental might be too strong of a word, but it is pretty damn close. It is endless amounts of meat prepared 15 different ways, all seasoned perfectly. You have to love something that is seasoned so well that if adding salt or pepper to it at the table would over season it. This place is pretty much a buffet that comes to you and after trying several meats its great because you don't want to move, lol. And the best part is, is that you tell them when to come to you!! I could go on and on but if you have about 60 bucks to spend and want to enjoy a great meal just go here and leave in physical pain from over eating like I do!!~~#~1
Yum! I was a fan of Grimaldi's...but this place surpasses them! We had half chicken tuscana (garlic cream sauce) and half chicken artichoke (pesto sauce). Amazing! Great flavors! Usually, I'm a fan of ranch on pizza fan (don't hate)--not needed here!Comes with the traditional crust, which was really enjoyable, but also available w/thin crust or wheat crust ($2 extra for wheat).Server (Zach) was nice, offered suggestions, and was on top of things. Kind of soft spoken, given the tv's and other restaurant noise. Hostess seemed like she was pretty excited to be there and everyone was polite.Prices weren't too bad--$18 for a large pizza, $8 for an individual. Variety of toppings, salads, appetizers, calzones, and drinks. Beers ranged from $3.75-$5 for the 16 oz. Excited to go back and try some more pizza!~~#~1
I cannot recommend Phoenix Knife House enough.  There are very few places where you can go and physically put your hands on so many different Japanese knives, which is obviously key in any knife purchase.  If you've ever spent hours in the kitchen doing prep and chopping, blisters are a very real possibility if the knife doesn't fit.  I've discovered over the last several years of cooking at home that I prefer a lighter and bolster-less knife for high speed chopping, which ultimately led me back to PKH for a purchase.  Last year I purchased a Fujiwara 150mm petty for less than $60, and it's been a great knife; my girlfriend also likes it because it's light and maneuverable.  She bought me a Misono UX10 for my birthday, which will ultimately replace my Henckels for most uses.  Bottom line, go in, tap into Eytan's knowledge of the knives (and care and maintenance), and get better tools for the job.  It's well worth it.I bring all my kitchen knives here to get sharpened, either by hand or on the grinding wheel.  Today I had four knives sharpened, three on the wheel, one by hand, and two with tip damage.  Total cost = $13.  Bonus: purchases are tax free.  Highly recommended.~~#~1
WOW what can I say... our friends have eaten here for years and we finally got to eat at Don and Charlie's for the first time in all the years that we have been coming to Spring Training.  We had an excellent dinner i was in the mood for fish and had the Macademia crusted Halibut.... WONDERFUL!!!!! My hubby had the prime rib and finished off every last juicy bite... the scalloped potatoes were the BEST I have ever had at any restaurant.Must make this one of our usual stops during our yearly visit to Az.~~#~1
Will never eat here again. Sandwich was meteocre and overpriced. On top Of that I was charged more than I was told the total was. Horrible first time experience!~~#~1
Saw this place in the Yelp email.  Needed to take my son to Toys R Us to use a gift card and it occurred to me that Habit Burger was right there, so I suggested we have lunch there rather than the usual McD's.  I temped him with the offer of a chocolate shake.I was amazed with the cleanliness and brightness of this place.  There was a line when we got there, but it moved quickly.  The tables were packed but we managed to snag a 2-top pretty soon after getting in line.  My son had the kids grilled cheese meal (something you don't find at your standard fast food place) and I had a charburger.  We shared his fries and the shake.OMG - the burger was heavenly!  The roll gets a little grill to it so it has a little crunch on the inside.  It was not greasy at all, just tasty and soooo good!  The fries were equally ungreasy and good - crunchy too.  The chocolate shake - my son only had about 3 sips which left me to drink the rest of it (dang it) - was absolutely delish.  And the prices were outstanding!Its a good thing there isn't a Habit Burger closer to my house.  I'd eat there all the time!  Five Guys?  Forget em!!!~~#~1
Went last week, and ordered a dozen variety. I didn't care for any of them, very dry, the frosting wasn't very good,even my 9 yr old daughter spit her cupcake out!~~#~1
We recently had a pleasure trip to AZ and I booked at the Fairmont Princess and I must say I made an AWESOME choice! - Room was I guess a standard King but it was so large and spacious with a couch and seating area as well as a very comfortably appointed bath and patio. The decor looked fresh and new as well. Very contemporary. Lovely. We were in building C and overlooked the rose/aroma garden which was quite quiet and pretty. Might have been a little better to overlook the lagoon with the firey fountain but we were pleased none the less.- Pools were the best. We swam in the main south pool, the east pool and used the slides the kids area as well. Did a lot of night swimming as it was hot and gotta tell you...night swimming rules! We rarely get to do where I live.- Restaurants and bars were very good...if a bit pricey...as well. We had dinner at Bourdon Steak by Michael Mina which was very tasty and nice ambiance. Ate at Hacienda Restaurant and also at the bar at an outside table. Kinda liked eating at the bar better. Yum of the drinks. - Great trip....great place...we will be back!~~#~1
My husband called the chicken fajita burrito one bad ass burrito. The carne asada burrito and quesadilla were equally yummy. Nice stop for a quick bite.~~#~1
Eh, lukewarm feelings about this one.  I had lunch here and the service was exceedingly slow even though the restaurant was not at all busy.  The server looked at me like a martian when I asked a question about the salad.   It may have been an off-day...  The food was good.  Inventive salads... it didn't exceed my expectations, though.  Hip mid-century modern decor...  I'm not sure that I would go back on my own nickle.~~#~0
Typical unpretentious dive bar where you can meet a friend after work, play pool, watch sports, whatever...  There's a pretty big food menu too.  I had the nachos once and they were quite filling and tasty.  Nice happy hour specials also.  I heard it was a place to watch Ohio State sports but it was pretty dead when I went there to watch a football game.  However, it was kind of nice getting a prime spot in front of a huge tv and the service was really good.~~#~0
I'm a girl who knows her way around a donut. The boyfriend and I would usually venture out to Chandler to get our Bosa Donut fix so I was super excited to discover they had opened a location closer to home. I was also super scared for my waistband.Bosa is hands down the best donut shop in the Valley. Not that there is a ton of competition but still. They're really good. They offer a wide variety from your classic cake to puffy glazed, filled to fritters. My favorite is the glazed twist. So chock full of sugary sweetness my teeth kinda hurt just thinking about it. Their donuts are always fresh and they keep a good stock available so you're not stuck with only the coconut donuts.I brought in a bunch to work the other day and my co-workers gobbled them up. Who doesn't love being handed a frosted piece of donut heaven?I'm sure I will become a regular of the Tempe Bosa in no time.~~#~1
This is great if you are in a hurry, they have slices and salads ready to go. Above average quality and a nice open space too. Perfect stop before or after catching a movie next door.~~#~0
Next Door Realty is fantastic!  Daradee Murray handled the short sale of my home recently and the entire transaction went unbelievably smooth.  From start to finish she was an excellent communicator.  She took all of our concerns into account and made the process a breeze for us.  I would highly recommend Next Door to anyone looking to buy or sell a home.  The personal attention you receive is unparalleled!~~#~1
I went here this morning for breakfast with the BF to use our living social deal. We had been to black bear before about 6 years ago in glendale and then again maybe 4 years ago up in Washington state. The last time we went, we were not terribly thrilled with the place. Anyway, we decided to give them another shot and it was pretty decent. I had the shasta scramble, which has avocado, onion, bell pepper, and spinach. This was good, it was not the most flavorful scramble I have ever had, but the veggies were fresh and I liked that this was an option on their menu because most places only have one veggie scramble and it has tons of veggies thrown in with no reason for those veg to go together...anyway, the breakfast came with a ton of country potatoes which I liked more than the typical hash brown. The BF got the one biscuit and gravy breakfast and he said it was alright, not the best ever, but not bad. I thought breakfast here was better than Denny's or Ihop, but clearly not as good as the Farmhouse or Liberty Market and the like of local breakfast places. The service was also good, but I thought it was so weird because our waitress kept calling us 'kids' and calling me sweetie, princess, and honey. I find this somewhat condescending, not that I think that was her intention, but I think that is unnecessary. I know this is kind of a diner thing, but I have never really cared for us, but maybe that's just me. The waitress was good at her job and attentive though, so that is what's important. Also, the portions are huge and I wish they had more options for half meals because I don't like to waste food, but I know people like the giant portion thing.... I would probably come back here for breakfast again sometime, however, because it is decently priced and has decent flavor.~~#~0
We happened upon this place on Sunday. We had our 2 1/2 year old with us and she was yelling about being hungry. We quickly ducked into Zinburger. All three of us had burgers. The kid's burger was huge and it came with fries. We also ordered the sweet potato fries. The people around us had milkshakes and they looked delicious. I also noticed fried zucchini and figure next time I'll order those instead of fries. We were in a rush and had something at 6 pm. We told the waiter we were in a hurry. He was great, friendly and accommodating. We were seated next to the hostess stand and my daughter kept trying to engage the folks standing there. Everyone was so nice. My constructive feedback would be that I ordered my burger medium well and I received it medium rare. It still tasted yummy and I ate it. Had it been served that way to my hubby - he would not have been able to stomach the red juice flowing from the burger.~~#~1
Addicted to duck fat fries!  Curry mayo is a perfect complement to duck fat fries.  Did I mention how awesomely delicious duck fat fries are?  You know what, forget that I said anything about duck fat fries.  They only make a limited amount and I don't want you to go.  Nope.  Don't go. I guess I should mention the rest of the menu.  Everything is awesome.  Nutella rules!  Seriously.~~#~1
This is another work lunch takeout place for me and it always does me right. I always get the Jerk Chicken bowl with rumbi rice and have never been disappointed by it. Good flavor, lots of chicken and veggies and rumbi rice is simply delicious. I personally like to add hot sauce and also sometimes splurge on a cup of tortilla soup -which is pretty freakin great. There's alot of cheese on top of the soup so lactose intolerants beware!~~#~1
I seriously can't get enough of this spicy goodness! All I ever wanna go is SIAM and nowhere else. I've been to so many Thai restaurants in AZ the past month and NOTHING compares to Siam! BEEF MA SA MAN curry is so addictingly amazing and the pad thai is always cooked to perfection. I'm actually craving it as I type this.~~#~1
For some reason these self serve frozen yogurt places have popped up all over the valley and they are all very similar. What I like about this place are the choices. I usually don't have any issues, I'm a mint chocolate chip man, and that's typically what I order. My girlfriend on the other hand likes to mix it up and try new flavors and toppings. This place has the largest selection of flavors and toppings of any of the self served frozen yogurt places we've been too. For those of you who are calorie conscience, as I am, they post the nutrition facts right buy the flavor so you know exactly what you're getting.~~#~1
OH T.T. at first you were intimidating...all these crazy people fumbling out of your doors....the odd screaming coming from the patio. Not to mention your lack of elbow room that causes your patrons to drunkenly shoulder check each other all night...but now i've grown to accept you. I don't love you yet...i'm still seeing other people...but i feel that we may have a future. see you soon T.T. like in a couple hours....~~#~0
John did a fantastic job on figuring out my overheating issue on my Infiniti after Grelichs failed to fix my car properly. John is more than fair with there pricing and are extremely knowledgeable. He has a customer for life from me.~~#~1
The obsession started about 2 yrs ago and I haven't looked back since...Started with getting them catered for lunch, then a trip here or there to the restaurant. SO. GOOD. The bread is amazing, but the love, sweat, tears and what ever else they pop in there is addicting. Hmmm, now I am wondering what it is they put in there?? Anyway, I won't think too long and hard about that one. But tomorrow I'm definitely heading back for the Vermonter, gotta feed the addiction.~~#~1
We've been going here for 25 years and I had my first BAD meal recently. A rotten chicken tamale, the corn meal might have had rancid fat in it or the chicken was rotten, either way it was stinky. The wait staff didn't seem outraged and shrugged it off as though this has happened before.  I may go back here in another year, but Rosita's Place is off limits for me now.~~#~1
If you're at all a "Foodie" you can't come to Phoenix, or anywhere within 50 miles and not visit Matt's Big Breakfast.  The wait outside is just part of the ambiance and culture of this tiny little place.  I hope they don't very enlarge this place....it would so spoil it.Food....have anything.  Its all cooked to perfection with love and kindness from a kitchen staff that really cares about freshness.  My personal fav's are the Waffle and Bacon and the multi grain toast with the fresh jam typically made locally....changes frequently. This was on Diner, Drive-ins and Dives a few years ago and its still the same bustling place as when Guy was there.Side note...this was way cool.  On our last visit there were 4 of us, and if you've been here you know there are only a couple of tables that seat 4.  So we're waiting outside when the server comes out hands us menus, takes our orders.  When we're seated about 15 min. later our food was delivered within minutes of being seated.  Helped us get in and out and helped them move a table.  Much appreciated service.~~#~1
What can I say... we eat here once a week for lunch cuz we can walk here. We come here for happy hour twice a week cuz we can walk here. So, yeah it's pretty convenient... but we STAY here after hours to play poker because the servers know us by name and the food is priced right and the poker crowd is really cool and it's a great place to eat-n-learn.And we LOVE Tony because that guy says hello to EVERY CUSTOMER EVERY TIME. Trust me on this one... jump off the freeway for happy hour... you'll know what I mean when Tony says hello to you, too.PS get the three meat calzone. You look great and can afford the calories...~~#~1
What an awesome business! Friendly, knowledgable people that make you feel like family when you come in. I can't to tell you how refreshing it is to walk into an audition and feel welcomed! Auditioning is a scary enough experience without feeling intimidated by your environment and the people auditioning you. Here you'll find great people who love what they do and have an extensive amount of knowledge and experience. Oh, and I also recommend taking one of Faith's workshops... I took one recently and I learned some very valuable tools that will definitely help me in future auditions :D~~#~1
Delicious food and excellent staff make this small French restaurant worthy of five stars. We began with a glass of fabulous wine that we brought (it is byob) and ordered the onion tart as an appetizer. The taste of the leeks coupled with the cheese, buttery and flaky pastry made this one of the most tasty ways to start a meal. I ordered the marinated chicken. This dish came with a juicy chicken breast with a light pesto sauce, mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach. The flavors intermingled to create a sensuous bite, time and time again. My girlfriend got the filet, which was juicy and flavorful and came with perfectly roasted potatoes and tomatoes. For dessert we ordered the tart of the day, which was fruit and coconut cream on top of a shortbread-tasting tart. Just delicious. The service was wonderful, very efficient and friendly. It is not cheap, it was $99 for the appetizer, two entrees and dessert...but for the experience and the exquisite flavors, I will go back for any special occasion... guaranteed.~~#~1
Everything you need to feel like you opened a time capsule!  Place makes me want to have 5 houses to slather in vintage odds and ends.  The place is very well organized and themed which makes it easy to find items while you're on the hunt.~~#~1
Love the idea - vegan Mexican. Have tried to eat there twice. Both times checked their FB page for hours, both times they were closed. Called their phone number, no one answered. No sign, no explanation on FB. Pathetic.~~#~1
Decent airport with a limited variety of food choices and a strange layout. It feels a little outdated but I was only at the airport for a quick layover.~~#~0
bank building turn to a coffee beanery is way cool. plenty of seats to settle yourself in and crack open your books and do your homework. the free wi-fi is helpful too, but the connection lags sometimes when their a bunch of people hopping online to check their myspace.it gets chilly at time, i suggest bring a sweater if you're the unlucky one seated underneath the A/C vent. the vault room is great when trying to escape the loud chatter in the main room, just don't forget to turn off your cell phone when you're in there, it's kind of rude...if you wanna be shaking out of your pants, i suggest the Iced Toddy. it's strong and it should keep you up all night if you have a big project the following day.customer service is very nice and helpful.~~#~1
I think its about time I wrote a formal review for this establishment, considering I have recently bestowed it as "My Favorite Restaurant" - that's a big title to carry. I often judge Mexican restaurants based solely on their chips and salsa and Gallo Blanco passes that test.  They have a delicious green tomatillo and smoky chipotle - as well as the typical hot sauce and fresh pico.  Their chunky guac is delish and summery, as they put orange slices in it. Although the chiccharon gets a lot of buzz (I think it taste like Cheez-Its), their best appetizer is the Elote - grilled corn-on-the-cob with cheese on it. It literally melts in your mouth! Oh, and it doesn't get stuck in your teeth like most corn-on-the-cobs tend to. The orange cake is AMAZING and reminds me of my beloved red velvet - except, you know, orange. I love everything about this restaurant - salsas, food, drinks, atmosphere, prices, entertainment (on Wednesday!) - they just need to get rid of that damn giant, ugly, silver air conditioning thing they have running through the bar.~~#~1
Bobby Q is GREAT! We enjoyed EVERYTHING: brisket sandwich, baby back ribs, brisket with spicy sauce - yum!!! Blooming onion - just right! Baked potato crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside  withe barbeque pork and the fixings......mmmmmmmm!  Our waitress perfect - Go - now!~~#~1
This store made me feel like I had died and went to fabric heaven.  There is just so much beautiful, wonderful, amazing fabric.  I dropped a pretty penny- but I've already used some of my perfect fabric for great projects.The place is clean, the staff is super friendly and patient- especially with newbies like me.  When I brought 10 different reams of fabric up and had to stop and really think about how much I needed- patience came with a smile.  It seems like everything (even the high end designers) are around $10/yard.If you get bogged down with all the fabric that you are falling in love with, they have a cute little table set up with these funny little signs that say "get your paws off my fabric" which made me chuckle.  Maybe I'm turning into an old lady who loves silly stuff like that.Despite the somewhat sketchy location, 35th Ave. Sew and Vac is my new go-to for fabric!~~#~1
Niro's is a staple.  Quick, easy lunch that hits the spot when you're feelin like gyros.  I'm not saying it's the best gyro I've ever had, nor am I saying it's the cheapest (around $9 total), but it gets the job done.  I usually get the single gyro meal when I go.  The fries are the thick cut super crispy kind, and the gyros are cooked well, with plenty of sauce (not sure what people are saying about it being dry, my hand's are always a mess after eating one of these), and onions and tomatoes to boot.  Great in-and-out spot if you didn't bring lunch to work on any given day.  Plus, the owner is always really nice and friendly.~~#~0
Bad music, slow service, disgusting overpriced drinks, and annoying patrons.  Definitely wouldn't come back if someone paid me to. I can't even drink this margarita.~~#~1
Anyone who tells you this place isn't amazing is cu cu for coco puffs. The owners are equally amazing. They will remember you and tell you amazing stories and the cocktails are always amazing. My favorite is the lychejito made from lychee infused vodka made in house. The spring roll bar is amazing and they always change it up for me if I ask for substitutions. There really isn't anything on the menu that isn't good they offer everything from Vietnamese sammies to amazing clay pots. I always go for the soup but that hasn't stopped me from trying everything else. Everything is always fresh and delicious. Their happy hour is awesome as well.~~#~1
So I'm apparently oblivious to the fact that anything with the name Joe is owned by the same person.  Luckily for me, I wasn't stupid enough to order bbq pork again.  Joe's Farm Grill is a pretty cool concept and probably the only decent place to eat on this side of the 202 (since Mobsters INC closed, at least).  There are enough review here that clearly he is doing something right.  Suburbanites love to feel like they don't live in a city and, I'm sure, love the idea of a restaurant with picnic tables and trees.  They must because the place was a freaking day care when we went, with snotty brats running all around and climbing on everything.Anyways, back to the food.  I ordered a BBQ Bacon Burger.  I didn't bother to specify how I wanted it cooked and it was, surprisingly, cooked to a decent medium-well.  I subbed some sweet potato fries with it and they were pretty good.  Little more pepper would have made them great but oh well.  The wife had wanted to sub the veggie fries with hers but they made us order a side of them.  That side was literally 3 pounds of fried veggies and was way too much for any human to consume.  They weren't really my thing but the wife enjoyed.This place does a lot of things well but they suffer from a lot of the logistical problems that Joe's BBQ does.  The line is better and it keeps people from getting backed up but they seem to run out of menus quickly.  People grab them, carry them in line, and leave them at the window.  As a result, there are no menus left when people walk in.  I refilled the thing twice while I was standing in line.  Also, the condiment/drink counter is outside and all in a row right by the door into the restaurant.  These weird clusters of people trying to get a drink or some sauce develop and creates an obstacle course for people going in and out of the restaurant.  This leads me to my final problem - the indoor pickup window.  While the summer is long and hot (and I'm sure leads to a lot of people usually sitting inside), the day we went had tons of people sitting outside.  When their buzzers went off, they had to go inside to pickup the food.  The single door seemed to be all sorts of hazardous for people going in to get food and people coming out with food.  Finally, and I know this sounds stupid, but the trash can outside has the smallest opening ever.  You cannot actually stick your plastic basket inside the trash can and turn it over to dump your food out.  You have to pick the stuff up out of the basket and throw it away with your hands.  I just finished my meal, cleaned my hands, and now I have to wash them again because I had to handle a greasy, sauce-covered piece of paper to throw it away.I know this sounds nitpicky but it turned what would normally be a 4-star peaceful lunchtime experience into a logistically stressful nightmare for me.  When you make it hard for me to get in and out with my food, it makes me feel like you don't want me there.  I know they are going to read this and I know they are going to dismiss it just like my gripes about Joe's BBQ but do me a favor, when you build your next restaurant, hire someone with a degree in urban planning to help with the layout instead of just cramming things wherever you think they will fit.~~#~0
I originally came here because I heard they have a gluten free menu--i expected one or two pizzas, probably cheese and one other choice. But they have a FULL menu of pizzas, salads, and appetizers that are gluten free. and they are DELICIOUS! Pizza was my absolute favorite food in my past, gluten-filled life. Anything from Slices to Pizzaria Bianco. I have tried gluten free pizzas almost everywhere you can find them, and they are always too dry, too thin, too soggy, or completely different flavor than what pizza crust should taste like. Picazzo's gluten free pizza is delicious, the crust is pretty thick and has a good texture, not like a big saltine cracker as most places tend to be. the flavor is true to pizza crust! my friends even like it so much they will split a gluten free pizza with me instead of ordering 'regular' crust.There is also a range of appetizers that are delicious, caprese salad with gluten free bread and the spinach dip are my faves. The employees are all very nice and aware of gluten intolerance--they check with you before they bring you additional food items or before putting GF and non-GF foods together in your to go box. I love it. If you are gluten or wheat intolerant and  you like pizza, this will be your new favorite place. Totally worth the drive, and the money. But the prices are very reasonable for GF food!~~#~1
Mastro's serves up the best steak in Scottsdale.  They also offer delicious seafood and excellent side dishes.  Prices are steep. After 10pm this place becomes a pick up joint for gold digging women seeking sugar daddy's.~~#~1
I will start this review off by saying that I would normally have given this place 4 stars, but for a large dog-friendly patio, and immediate water bowls the minute your dogs butt hits the ground, they get the extra star. We went today, a Sunday, and sat down next to people that had the exact same dog that we have (a female harlequin Great Dane) and knew that it was fate.  We sat by them, because they seemed awesome and in great company, the food flourished in my eyes.  They have a pretty decent beer selection, they had my favorite Sonoran White Chocolate ale and my boyfriend had something he loved on tap called the Bell's Two Hearted Ale (but apparently it's an amazing IPA). I knew I'd love mine, he LOVED his.We had the Mac and Cheese, which was awesome, but not as amazing as others I've had.  So order it if your a Mac person, but don't if you're not.  We had two sandwiches for dinner, I had the Acapulco Cheesesteak (UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!!!!!!!)  and Seann had the RB&C (an equally impressive Roast Beef concoction). Those were both devoured with great beer and great conversation with others.Lastly we had the Triple Chocolate Brownie, per a recommendation from our fellow dog owner and it was delish.  VERY VERY chocolatey and too much food after an app, a sandwich and two beers, but it was definitely worth trying.Overall the food would have gotten a four, but the experience with cool people around us, and a great waitress really sealed the 5 star deal.  Now being added into the rotation.  Thank you Main Ingredient! : )~~#~1
Ok.  Not great for what is supposedly a good steak joint.  Not much ambiance and food was good not great.~~#~0
Yummy yummy yummy! Absolutely loved it - kick back, quiet, people nice, not crowded and breakfast was crazy yummy!~~#~1
My boyfrind and I attended here this past weekend on Serptember 8,2012 to celebrate our one year anniversary. Every employee went out o their way to tell us Happy Anniversary. We were seated quickly after entering the restaraunt. Our waiter was knowledgeable, friendly and very professional. We were given our own privacy to celebrate intimately. The food was amazing and we both enjoyed our selves so much!! Thank you Meling Pot. We are going to make you our annual celebration spot!!!~~#~1
Cute busy place in Central Phoenix. Not hiding behind gimmicks to make themselves authentic. Simple and sweet. Staff is well versed in Japanese food, if you haven't had it in years ask. Great staff, great food, great times.~~#~1
I think they need to hire a better chief; the food doesn't taste right.My mom said she can teach them how to cook for free.~~#~1
Never Again,I brought my Mountain Bike in (which I bought 1 week earlier from Walmart) to have them replace my flat inner tubes with puncture resistant tubes.)  I came back 20 minutes later when they said it would be done and as I rode away, the back tire rhythmically rubbed against the back brake.  When I returned and told them about it, I was told the back wheel was not true.  It was true for the whole short week since I purchased it from Walmart.  I plan to take it to their competitor (Landis) and pay the extra $15-$25) to have the wheel put back to the straight condition it was in when I brought it to Slippery Pig in the first place.   I would never give a shop another penny for an extra service I should never have needed on a brand new bike which coasted perfectly when I brought it in.~~#~1
Went in for acrylics on Friday and it was horrible! I've been getting acrylics for years and it has never been a problem to have them filed down...until this time. The tip of one finger was filed down so bad that it's blistered. (At least the nail tech put some antiseptic on it so it's not infected.) Also, when I put some lotion on my hands Tuesday a lot of my nails started getting sticky and filmy like they were going to disintegrate. NOT NORMAL! I removed mine today and found that my nails were finely filed, so it looks like they would have fallen off soon anyway. I'm not going back there again.~~#~1
I have visited Tokyo Stop twice now for an a-ok lunch. There's nothing really bad about Tokyo Stop, but it just hasn't blown my socks off. On my first visit I had the bulgogi plate. It was HUGE. Full of hot marinated beef and a large serving of white rice. I've had bulgogi several times before and this bulgogi is a-ok. Again, not the best I have had, but not bad! I poured Sriracha all over it and I was a happy girl! The second time I visited, I ordered the teriyaki chicken combo. Again, another a-ok dish. Nothing fancy! The prices for each dishs is VERY reasonable. I don't think I've paid over $7 for anything.I would most certainly visit Tokyo Stop again. They offer a solid lunch at reasonable prices.~~#~0
i visited on jan 19 and ordered the thai basil (their signature dish) with calamari, which had a very unique flavor that was a bit masked by the spiciness. i'm a wimp when it comes to spices, and i was overwhelmed by the medium i ordered. though the dish was very good, it was, for a dish dish consisting mostly of vegetables, on the scant side for 11.95. my friend ordered a curry, and it was a sizable portion, presented in a clay pot. i sneaked a bite, and it was very good too.the place is comfortable and intimate, with booths and tables, and the wait staff is very friendly.~~#~0
In town for business, and came to Pappadeaux's for dinner...what a great experience.  Hostess, wait staff, and servers were all outstanding.  The food was amazing.  Perfectly cooked vegetables to accompany the Costa Rican Mahi.  Ice cold beer on a hot, 102 degree day was a welcome addition!Although we later found out our waiter was in training (it was his first day), he was attentive, professional, and available to answer any questions we had.Highly recommended.~~#~1
I've been to a ton of Pho places here in the valley, and this is the best one I've been to, by far.  The prices are reasonable and the Pho was fantastic.  The rolls were pretty good, but not the best I've had around here (that honor belongs to Saigon Pho, not too far from this place.  BBQ beef rolls there are fantastic, but I digress).  I haven't tried anything else at Pho Van, but it all looked pretty good too.  The place is super clean and the service was ridiculously fast (I don't know if it was just my luck or if that's a regular thing).I want to come back, but it's not close to my house.  However, it's worth the drive if you ever get that Pho craving.~~#~1
Count us in for a #5 Combo, a Oaxaca Special & two hard tacos....maybe some chips and salsa to go!Best Mexican fast food around..and cheap!Always busy at lunch, but they get through the orders in a timely manner.  Seating can be tricky, so have one order and another stalk tables! :)You can park behind the place and walk through the back door....little FYI.~~#~1
My boss asked me to find someone to clean the office windows (about 50 large panes) inside and out, so I got in touch with Brad.  He was very professional throughout the experience, and his mastery of this craft is phenomenal.  The windows were crystal clear within a few hours; he did a very thorough job.  Punctual, efficient, and easy to work with--his rate was very competitive, and his work is worth every penny!  The office looks brand new.~~#~1
Ladies in the flooring section are very knowledgeable and helpful.  Though I do think they are a bit understaffed, they were gracious and friendly.  Fairly large in stock flooring section compared to other stores.~~#~1
Just moved to AZ and this is my local Petco. Everyone's really helpful and friendly. We just took our dogs here to get groomed and they came back smelling fresh and looking clean.~~#~1
Enterprise Pools keeps my pool looking PERFECT for swimming!  Not only do they preform top-notch weekly service, sweeping, clearing the baskets and making sure the chemicals are right, but they are great at communicating.One of the tough things about owning a pool and not being a pool expert is knowing what's going on.  They always take the time to explain what's happening in a way I can understand.Broken pump or filter? No problem! They do repairs too.  They'll even fill you in on what you need to do as the seasons change, or how to handle those pesky, pool destroying, monsoon storms!~~#~1
Two words for you. Mouth.  OrgasmWifey and I decided to eat here for our 5 year wedding anniversary. I have to say this is one of the best meals I've ever eaten, hands down. We bought a Restaurant.com gift certificate that cost $10.00 for a $50.00 Gift Certificate. They also have half priced bottles of wine on Friday nights as well.I went with the 5 course menu. I chose 2 of the dishes, and let the chef pick the other three. We started out with the Crudo Cheese plate that was phenomenal! It had goat cheese, goat feta, goat mozarella (sooo good), cherry compote, roasted dates, tomatoes, cured lamb jerky, smoked olives and truffles with toast. If that doesn't give you a food stiffy, your not human. The first dish I had, which was one I picked, was the butterfish crudo. It was served with oven roasted tomatoes and lardo with some sort of escebeche type sauce, hands down my favorite plate in Phoenix right now. Holey cow! Next, I had the albacore crudo with truffles, apples, black garlic and pepper. Another amazing dish. My next dish was one the chef selected as well, it was their Japanese Fish Market Special. I don't recall the type of fish, but it was good. I felt bad for this plate though, it had to follow some illlll dishes. The 4th course I had was the mushroom gratin. It had hen of the woods, crimini, potato and was topped with an egg. I felt it was just too much, a little clunky. That's probably just my taste though, there was nothing wrong with the execution of the dish. I finished with the roasted veal served with parmesan creamy polenta. Friggin amazing, I wanted to whisper sweet nothing into it's ear and smack it on the boohiney.  We went with a great bottle of Nebbiolo, that was exceptional. The service was excellent. At first I was kind of weirded out with the restaurant being inside a retail shop, but we moved to one of the high top tables and it felt more like a quaint little cafe. What a great meal, fargin amazing!!  Pics to come~~#~1
Best TexMex in the valley! The chips and salsa are home made and probably the best I have ever eaten. I had shrimp tacos which were delicious, staff was very friendly and down to earth.....if you ate downtown give them a try.~~#~1
Tried Roy's for the first time last night when we met some friends who rave about their Aloha Hour (Happy Hour).  Always avoided going because we tend to not like restaurant chains, but this place is a gem and exceeded our expectations.The bar area is relatively small, but very classy.  We were able to have few drinks at the bar ($5 for beer, wine, and their signature cocktails) before we were able to get a table in the bar area for 5 people...thanks to Leah and the hostess staff (you guys are great).  Didn't have a bad drink -- loved the The Original Hawaiian martini was delish, as was the mojito, jalapeno margarita, mai tai, and wine.  A friend was sad the cucumber drink she liked was missing from the menu, but sounds like the menu changes often so diners/drinkers get a chance to try new concoctions throughout the year.  For food, we tried most of the HH specials.  Everything was spot on -- excellent flavors and beautifully presented.  The tuna roll and tempura shrimp rolls were my favorites (sushi rolls), with the lobster pot-stickers being a close second.  Some friends ordered dinner...and were able to speak with Chef Bray about his recommendations for fish.  She ended up getting the Crab Dynamite Baked Barramundi, which was so yummy!  The happy rice on the side was great too.   My hubby got the Yellow Fin Ahi Poke -- something we have looked for since trying some fresh poke in Kona, HI last year.  I couldn't believe the flavors...eating poke in the AZ desert!  Its preparation with the Wasabi Crème Fraîche made it a meal we will seek out again in the near future.  Ended our meal by sharing the chocolate souffle, which was a perfect ending to a great Friday night gathering.  Definitely recommend Roy's for seafood that is excellently prepared.  Aloha Hour is a must.  Extra props to Matt, our waiter, and Leah on the hostess team for their accommodations and service.  We had a great night.~~#~1
Troy, the owner, is a brilliant businessman! Being a pharmacist myself, I am familiar with the quality of his products and his facility. Trust me when I say his sterile compounding areas are more advanced than many hospitals in the Valley.After spending a day at his old facility when I was still training, I felt comfortable enough to send my mother to Troy so that he could help her with hormone replacement therapy. The docs around town trust him enough to let him dictate what a patient needs; they simply sign off on his recommendations. My mom has had a huge increase in her quality of life since seeing Troy, and I feel the compounded HRT is safer than the Prempro she used to take.Do not hesitate to consult a compounding pharmacist if you're having health issues that aren't being adequately addressed. Troy is one of the best in the Valley. It's worth the drive to consult with him, and further prescriptions can be mailed to your home.~~#~1
I love this restaurant concept. It makes for a fun dinner between friends and family. I wish there were ones like it in Central Phoenix so I don't have to drive a half hour for good food and a good dining experience. The veggie options offered are plentiful and fresh, which is important to me. The broth is so flavorful. But be warned weak tongued restaurant-goers, the spicy broth has a kick that will stick!Some are saying it's too expensive? I think it's worth it.~~#~1
Don't let the slightly sketchy neighborhood put you off.  Baiz market has some of the best food in town.  The small deli (cafe?  Not sure what to call it) located in the market has all of the staples such as shwarma and falafel.  the prices are cheap, The service is snappy and friendly, and the food is exceptional, especially considering the price.  Wash down your meal with any one of many exotic drinks (or, just choose a diet coke) in the beverage cooler.  Even if you've stuffed yourself silly, wander on back to the bakery.  The assortment of traditional Middle Eastern sweets can't be matched anywhere in town.  Come early and wander around in the market to pick up your selection of hard to find ingredients.~~#~1
This used to be one of my favorite restaurants but the service went way down hill.  The new owners hire lots of college students with tattoos everywhere as well as lots of piercings.  Seems like tattoos and too many piercings are a job requirement along with disrespect and a lack of desire.  The staff is what made this place the worst restaurant ever and doesnt seem to matter how often you let management know I just dont think they care.  Also in the past few years there is a growing number of homeless that sit out front begging for money.  They sit so close to the outside patio that you have them dining with you or at least it feels that way making you incredibly uncomfortable.  Our last visit we sat on the patio which was next to a bench just outside the restaurant where a few homeless were stationed.  One girl had a huge rat on her shoulder and it was beyond disgusting.  Management obviously doesnt care and does nothing to improve anything so we go way out of our way now to eat at the other Greek in Chandler at Chandler Mall.~~#~1
Went to this place for lunch. I've spent a lot of time in Greektown in downtown Detroit, so I'm very familiar with good Greek food. The atmosphere is fun (like most Greek spots), and servers were a young, attentive, and attractive group. The food is pretty good and there was a large enough crowd to justify the 18 minute wait for my meal. All in all a pretty good lunch spot...heard that the expanded happy hour really packs 'em in, so naturally I HAVE to go back to get my OPA on!~~#~0
The service has always been really good.I love LOTS of things on the menu. The dixie pan fried chicken is great.  There's a great little sticky bun that comes with it.  The Del mar salad is great.  I've had great experiences going to chelsea's kitchen.  Overall it's in my heavy rotation on places I always say YES, let's go there!~~#~1
A very reliable local garage. Bill is all about great customer service, and goes the extra mile. He deflated my fears about "being taken" by other mechanics playing on my automotive ignorance. He's a truly good guy, knows his stuff, and will work to save me money if he can find it. I trust Bill, and 25th Street Automotive. Thanks, and we'll continue to bring our wheels into your shop.~~#~1
I, like another reviewer, was not willing to fight for lunch at McDonald's... and so I travelled up the road to Burger King. I haven't been to a BK in years and have heard several quips about their "new and updated menu." I got a Whopper Jr. meal (no update there). Their fries are good, more satisfying than other fast food restaurants-- "now with sea salt"-- as if that makes them more appealing. The Whopper Jr. itself is just... meh.. I'm sorry, I don't do mayo. I do appreciate the fresh (?) veggies on top though. Soda seems syrupy here to me.If McDonald's is busy, head here. They DO have a nice outdoor patio, though. And Iike their workers' uniforms better. Does that count??~~#~0
Of all the Chipotle's I really like this one.  The staff is exceptionally friendly and I don't think I've ever been in the place, and I've"ve been a lot, where they weren't meticulously cleaning the restaurant with soapy suds.~~#~1
Dig it! Good beers on tap. Tasty food. Friendly servers. Cool place to hang out and relax. My fav pasty is the cajun chicken with the spicy sauce. Don't forget to check out the desserts. Towards the back is an iPad where you can pick a few tunes to be played..kinda neat if you're in the mood for something in particular. If you haven't checked it out, you should. I like this location better than the Tempe location because it has more seating and a better scene for visiting with friends.~~#~1
How can anyone not give these guys a 5 star?  Cafe Rio invented the sweet pork burrito and nobody...and I mean NOBODY can do it better.  I moved here a year ago from Utah where Cafe Rios are as abundant as Micky Dees .... and I was so happy to see the Cafe Rio sign.  I eat there to much.  Its a 30 min drive to get there from where I live, but I love that I don't ever have to wait in line as long as I did when eating at the Utah ones...Let me help you with what to order:  No serious if you are reading this...go there TODAY and order this - Sweet pork burrito with black beans, hot sauce, enchilada style with pico and guac ... no lettuce (unless you like lettuce ... I don't)~~#~1
Mill Ave has been missing a good breakfast nook, and it has made me very sad. Until now! The atmosphere is very modern. The color scheme is gray, orange, and black and boy do they stick to it, down to the orange frosted cupcakes. Impressive. I had the best french toast I have ever had in my life right here at NCounter. I have only eaten here once, and usually I don't give five stars out after the first visit, but this place is THAT good. So happy to have such a fabulous breakfast restaurant so close to home.~~#~1
1 star for service and attitude.The food was delicious , but the staff was very hateful. I am writing this review. I don't remember the waitresses name but I do remember that she was short , hispanic , and she was pregnant at the time. She was incredibly hateful.So hateful and rude to me and my parents. I do know why she did this is because I am transgendered. I was wearing leggings and I was carrying a black polo purse. So I thought that this happened because of how I was dressed and how I looked , but that really wasn't the case.I went back 2 weeks later and I dressed differently. More "manly" (ha). Different waitresses , same great food , same hateful attitudes. I will stress to everyone reading this to save your time and money and go to a different pizza hut or a different pizza joint to get better service.~~#~1
Great Job!~~#~1
Wait a second...I have not written a review!  This is nuts!!!!!Anyways...I adore this place.  LGO and the pizzeria are my favorite places in the world...lol...I am here at least 4-6 times per week.  It is nuts!  Anyways..the reason I am here all the time is because it is FABULOUS!!!!  This place can never go wrong!  The orange and fennel salad it amazing!  It is the perfect mix and each bite and a delight in your mouth and to your taste buds!  I often get this salad through out the week.  I love the kale and quinoa salad too!  It is my go to salad.  I am obsessed with the avocado pizza with prosciutto and goat cheese and the roasted corn pizza with prosciutto.  I wish I could get enough but I cannot!  The ambiance is awesome! Mr.Lynn is a genius and made this place so welcoming and open.  I love how its so laid back and romantic at the same time.  The parking is difficult, but you expect that since it is so popular!  Now the Peanut Butter Pie!!!  OMG OMG OMG!!  There are no words...it is DELICIOUS!!  I try to refuse every time but I cannot.  I really enjoy the sangria.  The wine selection is great!  I just love this place!!!!~~#~1
The place to go during spring training after a game and see a baseball player (will be crowded for sure). the experience is just really neat though, the place is covered head to toe with sports memorabilia, definitely the place to go if you're a visiting sports fan in scottsdale~~#~1
Came here on a Friday night after a bike ride. As an Irish bar, there is a lot of whiskey on the wall, but they can make whatever you need. The food was a hell of a lot better than I thought it was going to be. On the encouragement of the bouncer, I ordered the wings which were meaty but I've had better. What I should have gotten was the shepards pie. 2 of my friends got it, and it was VERY good. I'm going to go back, just get it on my own. Lastly, this place dishes out cheap, strong drinks. Good place to get sauced before hitting a club.~~#~1
We attended this event today and loved it! The grounds are beautiful and spread out so it didn't seem like it was overly crowded. This is a well thought out event with food trucks located throughout so if you get hungry, there will be food near by.The admission price was $7 and we felt it was a bargain. There are a variety of artists so there is something for everyone to look at and/or buy.~~#~1
I should have done this so long ago, but we forget our Doctor's need reviews too! I've sent my boyfriend, my family and my friend's to her. You should know about her too! I've been going to Dr. Bradley for 10 years! She is my all time favorite doctor because she is always bright, smiling, genuine and just overall warm! You want to thank her and hug her at the same time. Her staff is professional and friendly. Mandy at the front desk is wonderful at her job. I've followed Dr. Bradley to 2 locations and would never think of going anywhere else. She's helped me with everything from migraines to pnuemonia to well woman check ups to getting my gall bladder removed! What a versatile and knowledgeable woman she is! I take my son to her now and he isn't afraid to go in. Peace of mind knowing we will be treated well, and taken care of is all I could really ask for in a general doctor!~~#~1
Just had my first hot dog at Short Leash Dogs and quite honestly, I can't call it a "hot dog" because that just conjures up images of, well... a hot dog. And Short Leash Dogs are so much more and better than "a hot dog" the way most people know hot dogs. Know what I mean? No? Well, go have a Short Leash Dog. Really unique combinations, various dog options (all local meats and produce) - bratwurst, beer hot, veggie... My friend and I shared an Aiko (we chose the brat as our dog), with mango chutney, red onions, cilantro, mayo and jalapeño on a naan (you might have read that in other reviews, no traditional buns here!). You can find the Short Leash Dogs truck at the Phoenix Public Market on Wednesday evenings and Saturday mornings, and if you follow them on Twitter (@shortleashdogs) you can find out when/where else they make regular stops... scottsdale, central phoenix... Track 'em down and eat their food. And talk to them - Brad and Kat are smart enthusiastic folks with a great sense of humor and offer superb food and service! What's not to love?~~#~1
Normally have had great service & food here, but on Father's Day, Nicole H was simply horrible.  Rude, slow, non-helpful, etc.  Just a total fail.  A different food-deliverer brought out food and "auctioned it off" (didn't know who got what), and I asked for a refill on my empty water glass, but he didn't bring it after 15 minutes, and Nicole didn't notice, so I had to bring it up to her.Their bloody Mary's taste just like tomato juice with tobasco.  Nothing special at all.  And for $12???!?!?!??!?!  SHAME.The coq au vin was great.WHY IS THERE NO "CONTACT US"/e-mail address ON THEIR WEBSITE?????~~#~1
Southwest blows its competitors so far out of the water I actually feel bad for the other airlines.  1. Of the countless times I've flown with them, my flight has been delayed only twice and both times less than one hour.2. NO BAG FEES.  3. Nine times out of ten the lowest price.4. Killer customer service, laced with sarcasm, veiled cynicism, and high efficiency.  I love it.5. They never give me an inquisitive look when I order a cocktail on the super early morning flights.  Thank you for not judging me, SW Flight Attendants.~~#~1
I've swung into Echo a few times and haven't ever had a bad cup of coffee. The cappuccino is pretty solid and the zucchini bread I had for breakfast one day was a win. If I recall correctly it came in a cute little box too.For some reason I've never been able to feel relaxed and at home enough to chill and enjoy an afternoon or evening there. Not sure why, but just haven't.~~#~0
i hate going to places that i can goto near home, in Phx for the Cubs games.. but my daughter wanted pizza and we saw Z and had to go becuz we know how good it is. I like this one alot better then ours.~~#~1
BACON, people!  Spicy Italian sausages, brats, even heirloom veggies by the pound?  Locally raised hogs and none of the extra chemicals the corporations and grocery stores use?  I have found my personal piggy promised land and it is The Meat Shop.  I headed over here with some buddies after hearing that some local restaurants and patrons have been taking notice of the flavor and quality they offer.  We were quite pleased.  The staff were helpful and knowledgeable about the meats, cuts, and preparation.  We grilled up everything that night - the sausages, the brats, the veggies... even the bacon... because, why not?  I think we spent a grand total of $20 and we still had enough leftovers to throw in with some sunny side up eggs and toast the next morning for breakfast.  This place is fantastic and surprisingly the same cost as most of the stuff you'll find in the grocery store.  I can't wait to head back over for round 2!~~#~1
Love this place!  Their slices are delicious (and HUGE) and a great deal.  Service is always fast and good.  Their loyalty programs (frequent visits and VIP card) are also great.   The fact that they're locally owned and support the local community doesn't hurt either.  :)It's basically the only place I go to for pizza nowadays.  1 slice is more than enough, and I love that I can get it just the way that I want.  If you're a member of their VIP program (free to join) you can also get the slices for dinner too.~~#~1
As far as basic burgers go this is an OK option. The flavor is ok and basic toppings give everyone enough choice. Better than McDonald's yeah and similar to In-n-Out but nothing really special. Price is not cheap for a burger so I would expect a little more, but not more fries because they give you a bucket full and more.~~#~0
I love the Tempe Library. The Culture Pass is a great program, the audiobook selection is good, and the seemingly unlimited resources are wonderful.~~#~1
Really good food, fun atmosphere, great experience and totally unique and fun. I would way rather spend my money at a one of a kind, family owned shop than a cheaper- dime a dozen corporate mcdonalds.~~#~1
This place is too loud.  It would have been nice to have a meal without some lady yelling 'meatlog' across the room.  Also the waitstaff was somewhat incompetent and snobby.  The food was delicious but it's not something anyone can make themselves at home.  They are stingy with their bread even though it is now free. Lots of annoying things that will probably persuade me not to come back.~~#~0
I am in love.  This restaurant does everything a good restaurant should.  Ambiance, service and product were good.  The only disappointment I had was with the hour wait on the Monday we went without a reservation.My party of four had an excellent time celebrating a birthday.  Two had the short ribs.  Tender to a fault, served with delicious Bar-B-Que sauce and pecan grits.  One had the fillet with a spicy aioli and delicious potatoes.My meal was a huge pork chop, stuffed with Maytag bleu on a ancho bread pudding.  For an app I split the chop salad.  It deserves special mention and I do recommend it, but it is not a sustaining salad, more of a amuse-bouche.  For dessert we split the peanut-butter cheese cake, delicious.The beverages deserve some mention.  The wine list is this restaurants' only fault, it is tooooo long.  There is a smaller, delicious by-the-glass selection.  The beer selection is well crafted.  I had two of my favorite beers, Dogfishhead Chicory Stout, something I had only had by bottle, wonderful.I normally don't like high-priced eateries b/c there is often a lack of creativity, Cowboy Ciao doesn't disappoint.  Recommended over any Capital Griller or Flemmingsery for creativity and value for dollar.~~#~1
OK, I went based on Tim C.'s Yelp review of this place, and I am so glad I did. I rode my bike up there around 1PM Wednesday afternoon, and I have to say I was not disappointed. Even though it was hot out, the outdoor table was surprisingly cool and comfortable. I got an iced soy latte and it was so good. I don't know how to explain it, but there is great tasting espresso and there is bland espresso. This place just has great tasting espresso. I found out while I was there that Ted (the guy who made it) had roasted the beans himself. You can buy the beans from them if you are one of those industrious people who grind and brew your own espresso drinks...I am not. I prefer to leave that to the professionals.  He actually ground the espresso when I ordered my drink. If you get the chance please go see what I am talking about. You will notice how much better the espresso is.The place itself is so beautiful and relaxing. If you sit outside like I did, you are basically sitting in a big outdoor garden. It is kept cool by the overhead canopy and the swamp cooler air blowing out from inside the coffee shop. Ted was really friendly, I felt comfortable just hanging out for a while reading my book. Unfortunately, the coffee shop closes at 2 PM, otherwise I bet it would be beautiful at night. This place definitely looks like something that would be in a cool little town somewhere, and  not off of a busy street like Hayden Rd. Ted also told me he makes the lemonade himself fresh squeezed, something I love and will definitely try. When I go back, I think I will go a bit earlier.  I may do a bit of plant shopping as well while I am there...Bottom line: Great atmosphere, drinks, and service!~~#~1
Good, fresh chinese food, a little pricey.There are two types of chinese food. Cheap, greasy, satisfying chinese food in a questionable joint. And upscale atmospheric chinese food that aspires to captivate the same audiences that enjoy places like P.F Chengs. This would be the latter: an awhatukee hole in the wall version of P.F chengs. Very clean restaurant, nice atmosphere, and good service. You can tell their motif is such that they cater to the tukee types with a little more coin in hand :/. This is the kind of place you'll find a lot of older families, or much older groups of friends dining together in. Both the orange chicken, and the almond chicken were good, and were made barring on the side of caution when it comes to grease. They were big portions (for $8), with big fresh peices of white meat, fresh vegetables, and no MSG. There is no chance of this meal offending a pickier type with grease, textures, or flavors (which makes it less interesting in my opinion).Both dishes were good, but nothing amazing from the 2 dishes I tried. The green tea ice cream was good, but I've had better green tea ice cream :/ . their version was a little too heavy with cream, and could have used some fruit, or something creative to go with the ice cream. The only other dessert option was another flavor of ice cream.The service was great, very polite and friendly waiters.~~#~0
These guys are great.  I had an old Craftsman mower, probably 8yo, that even sat unused in a basement for a couple years.  It coughed and wheezed, barely even turning over.  I brought it to them and now it works (and even looks) brand new!~~#~1
Love the atmosphere and how trendy rhus place is, reminds me of Nip/tuck kinda, the way they have it set up. I had thd NY strip steak and i don not think it was worth the price. The steak did not come with a side. Sides are ordered seperately. Great customer service, however I don't think I will be eating here again.~~#~0
Was visiting Phoenix and wanted to try some of the best place.  Tacos Atoyac kept coming up so I decided to give it a try without reading all the reviews (was recovering from the cold a week before so did not want to do much reading) . It should not be bad if the reviews are all 4 and 5 stars. Came here on 12/23 evening close to 7pm.  Parked the car right in front and seemed no one was in there. It turned out they were closing early that night.  The menu was small and don't offer much explanation (I guess they figure everyone knows what's taco and burro) Place was clean but smelled like smoke when we walked in. Looking at the price, I figure the taco was small and confirmed with the big, tall white tattoo guy behind the cashier, so I know how many to order.  My parents wanted fish tacos (they only know Rubio's fish tacos and burritos *roll eyes*) and I ordered some al pastor and asada tacos.  Since I am from LA, I am spoiled with cheap, good tacos.  The ones from Tacos Atoyas was only a okay compare to the ones in LA.   Usually the tacos I have are overflow with meat, but these are only half way filled.  Taste was a okay too.  They also ran out of beef tamale that night which my dad wanted to try.Anyway... 4 1/2 stars? I don't think so.~~#~0
The people who are either stocking the shelves, cleaning the floors, or behind the counter have all been polite so far. I have nothing really bad to say, but nothing really great either. Keep perservering...maybe I'll write another review when something outrageous happens :)~~#~0
Super!~~#~1
Best value for your money,   Clean, comfy beds.  Quite.  Great breakfast that is included.~~#~1
I have a love/hate relationship with Costco. I love to support local businesses, but this is one of a couple of exceptions I make.  It seems they treat their employees fairly as most of the employees at this store seem to have been there for years if not a decade. One thing that gives me comfort in my purchasing is they have a terrific return policy and take about anything back.~~#~0
If you have to travel to Phoenix (Yay!) then chances are you have to travel through Sky Harbor (Boo!). There's also a decent chance you'll consider traveling on Southwest (Boo!) but as airlines (Boo!) in Sky Harbor (Boo!) go, you can do worse than Southwest.I'm not a huge fan of Southwest, although I'll give credit where credit is due, and that bags fly free thing is genius. Combine one of my least favorite carriers with what is probably my least favorite airport and you've got a recipe for disaster, but somehow it works out in Southwest's benefit. The gates are just as hard to reach for SWest as other carriers, and you're not banished to the edge of the universe for check-in or for baggage claim. They've got a decent presence here, so you may actually find a human who can help should you have a problem.Yes, they may leave you stranded on the runway for a while in 100 degree plus weather (check) or force you to dash across the airport with late arriving flights (check) but every once in a while it's a painless operation.~~#~0
British pubs aren't my favorite places to eat, since I am a vegetarian (who eats fish occasionally), but this place was pretty good. The building was cool and full of character and the service was very friendly. Kim was a great server, even though she was doing it all alone on New Year's day! She was very nice and efficient. The food was pretty good. I got fish and chips, but I don't prefer eating fried stuff often. I do have to say, they were good though. The outdoor seating is nice, but man....those birds are lethal! We got pooped on over and over and even our water was tainted! Not The Rose and Crown's fault, but it kinda ruined our experience. This looks like a great place to drink, hang out and even watch the game. I am sure it's a fun place, but just not my favorite.~~#~0
After our fav Mongolian place closed I was set on having Mongolian the night we came across AJ's.It was decent. It seemed a bit over priced. The soft serve was kinda gross and the chocolate was out of order. The all you can eat soup looked like it had been sitting there for a good 8 hours. Will I go back? Maybe. Was I impressed? Not really.Did I leave full? Yes.~~#~0
They don't serve food, they serve sex on a plate. At first glance the place looks like a hallway but it's really a flavor factory hidden away between two buildings no one cares about because those places don't have Pasty's. The service is fast , friendly, and the music is off the chain.  The food is not to be forgotten though, there are so many selections of Pasty variations that anyone with any craving will loose all control of there facial expressions. I only wish the place was bigger, there have been times when I've  had to wait for a space to open up but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  That time allowed me  to prepare myself for the nirvana inducing flavorgasm that is The Cornish Pasty Company.~~#~1
This is a great breakfast stop!  Gotta love the homemade biscuits... are you kidding me!  Awesome! CB is a huge chain but they do some great things.  The only thing is the way they have designed the space the servers are in the back a lot... too much.  They need to be on the floor more to make sure the cups stay filled up!~~#~1
Kindred Spirits has closed their doors. It is a sad thing that we on the west side of Phoenix cannot support such a friendly and community oriented business, AND one that gave you the option to drop by for a quick coffee or for a more complete dining experience. The live music on the weekends was also something a bit rare for our side of town, and will be missed. Richard and Debra did a marvelous job updating the space, and making it a warm and welcoming place. I am sorry that Youngtown has lost this business.~~#~1
Wife and I had the large burgers. Many options as to toppings, whole grain bun is also an option. Store is spotless and staff is young and cheerful. I had sw style w/guacamole and jalapeno, spouse chose classic american cheeseburger. We ordered sweet potato fries to split. They are awesome and the single portion was large enough for 2 1/2 people. We were advised (in advance) that burgers would be pink inside, which we prefer. If you want yours well done, ask. You order at counter, and the food is brought to your booth. This was our second visit, and we would return. Store is nnear movies in food are of Tempe marketplace, so expect to spend some time looking for a spot.~~#~1
The service at this location is absolutely atrocious. I went to the Starbucks to get a Frappuccino, as I've done many times at this location without issue. The employee working the counter had an absolutely revolting tattoo near her collar bone and a scowl on her face. She asked me if I had a membership AFTER I had swiped my card, then said "Too late," when I told her I had one.Then, the idiot with the spiky blonde hair made me a Frappuccino that was basically brown water. I told her to make it again. She made it again, then informed me that she put extra shots of chocolate in it, and I should ask for extra chocolate if I don't want it to taste like water. I have never had a problem with the way my drink tasted until that day, but apparently the problem lies with me.I'm not the one who chose a career in customer service. If the coffee slingers at this branch can't pretend to enjoy their jobs, they should be put out on the street.~~#~1
This is the best restaurant in Phoenix. My wife and I have been eating out here for years, Their servers are great and the food is always delicious. The entire menu is very good and the specials are always unique.Check out their website at http://www.phoenixcitygrille.com~~#~1
My hubby&I were in for lunch-approx 1:30PM. Was just us and 1 other customer. Ordered tuna salad sandwich&potato salad. Hubby ordered the cheeseburger&fries. Refills on my tea were not fast enough for me,I had to find someone. Hubby loved his burger,Angus I think. My homemade potato salad was not seasoned-loved the texture, but had to add salt&pepper for any flavor. A few "quotes" written on the walls was part of the decor. One from the class of the local high school has a misspelled word!!!! "anticipate" They put it up last Sept and its still wrong. Everything we ordered came as we asked for;server got it right. We might be back another time.~~#~0
The facility is very clean and I got in and out quick.  However, the staff lacks personality and friendliness.~~#~0
Food is great, but service is horrible.  The servers are rude and it took a 30 minutes to get our drinks and another 30 for our food. I really liked this place when it first opened.  We live in the area and had hoped for this to be a regular place for us to come to eat, drink and meet friends. I hope the management fixes the problem with the service.  If you are going to try this place, I suggest you sit at the bar for better service.~~#~0
I stopped in with a friend on a Saturday night after a friend had recommended it to me and was totally thrilled we did. We sat at a table for sushi and waited no longer than 10 minutes for a table - amazing for 8 pm on a Saturday in old towne.Unfortunately, they had sold out of the oysters, but the other dishes we'd ordered were fabulous - starting with a seared tuna dish, then softshell crab roll, rainbow roll, and the green mussels. The seared tuna was cooked and cut perfectly - just the right temperature with a peppery "rub," the rolls were a decent size with thick cuts of fish and plenty of flavorful crab, and the mussels were a tad overcooked for my preference but the creamy texture and buttery flavor still made it a winner. The thing I appreciated most was actually the service - we weren't rushed or hassled, and the food came out a dish at a time, giving us a chance to eat and enjoy before getting our next dish. At other sushi joints, I am constantly feeling rushed while trying to fit all of the dishes on the table (and I'm not what you'd call a slow eater!). This was a happy medium for me. The server confirmed that we were ready for the bill instead of just dropping it off without asking - it's the little details that make a big difference to me.My only other con was creepy old men leering at us from the bar...but that's what you get in Scottsdale.~~#~1
I loved the old menu, but the changes gave me a change of heart. They had the best sandwiches & it was always quiet from 5 until 8 so you could sit & eat. The new menu is okay & we liked what we got, but we would've left if it wasn't happy hour. Even though the servings are big(maybe too big) the prices are retarded now. The buffalo chicken tenders were pretty good, but perhaps too spicy in the wrong way. I used to go & send people all the time, but without those yummy sandwiches & with the higher prices, we prolly won't make it back again. The servers usually are slow & fairly unattentive, but the menu was bringing us back.   :(    sad to see it change that way.~~#~0
My boyfriend and I went to Film Bar last night to see Iron Sky. Neither of us had been there before, and the decision was made quickly, so we had no idea what to expect. The bartender was incredibly nice, friendly, informative, and genuine. The prices for the bar were very reasonable, and I thought that $7 for tickets was MORE than reasonable. We were there more than an hour early, and it was so nice to just sit back on the low booths and chat.I gotta admit, I totally fell in love with this little place, and I can't wait to go back!My ONLY concern is that by the time our movie was done, there was a DJ playing music so loudly that you could hear it in the theater and you couldn't talk without shouting in the bar, so we had to go outside to converse with our friends. I would bet that the place doesn't have a DJ all the time, though.~~#~1
Treachery! Seek it out:Let me begin this review by saying that mine is not an indictment on this particular location but on every single P.F. Chang's I've had the misfortune of being dragged to.P.F. Chang's is effectively the Cheesecake Factory of bad Chinese food, with the disadvantage of not being as capable of delivering passable food. They bill themselves as a "gourmet" Asian experience, which is a bit of a laugh when they turn around and sell you their equally horrible frozen entrées right from the convenience of your local Wal-Mart. Everything is bland, overcooked, and ridiculously priced. Once you've paid nearly $14 for their "orange peel chicken", you may privately hope to yourself that they might have the audacity to include some fried rice. This is your second mistake. Sadly, the bistro calls you on your bullshit. You get white or brown--fried rice is several dollars extra and not at all worth it.Everything seems to be cooked just wrong--things that shouldn't be are too crispy, things that should be sauced are too dry, things that should taste good make you question the will of the gods, all the while you find there's no way to escape the treachery.Things get more and more frustrating as you dig deeper: P.F. Changs, while sounding vaguely Asian, is a wholly American creation. It was founded by Paul Fleming (in Scottsdale, actually) with SOMEone with some Asian influence to spice it up a bit, named Philip Chiang. (They literally cut out the poor bastard's "i" so that it would "fit on the signs better," or, as I like to believe, not scare away the flyover-states-white-folk so.) It's highly Americanized (and yes, I've had Chinese food in China, but I've also enjoyed great "American Chinese" food here) to the point of regrettable blandness and it is SO VERY EXPENSIVE you may find your credit score taking a ding after eating a plate of "wok charred beef", listed as one of the saltiest foods in America.The decoration is clumsy and their famous inclusion of terra cotta warriors are literally symbols of death. From Jennifer 8 Lee's Fortune Cookie Chronicles:'But not everyone finds the terra-cotta warriors charming. "Chinese people would never put that in a restuarant," Jim told me, pointing at the statues. "It's not lucky. It's something you put at a burial site! But in America, they think it's a Chinese thing." From a Chinese perspective, P.F. Changs is decorated with death.'Which is just fine, because everything there tastes like death anyway.~~#~1
As a frequent traveler into Scottsdale, I was looking for something new and different to celebrate with a young up and coming professional baseball player---who happens to be my nephew. We were forewarned this place had no prices on their online menu and appeared to be owned by Mastro's which consistently has excellent food. Michael Dominick opened Dominick's Lincoln Avenue Prime Steakhouse last fall after baseball season in the small, but excellent Scottsdale Quarter. (I'll admit to frequenting this Nike store in travels to Phoenix.) The ambiance is that of an elegant steakhouse. The rooms are dark with huge crystal chandeliers. Very opulent without being ostentatious!. We both ordered the bone-in filet which is an excellent aged prime cut. Supposedly, according to our very professional server, this cut is about 16 oz with a bone yielding about a 14 oz serving. My limit on steak is typical 6-8 ounces and I ate my entire meal, making me think (1) This place really is THAT GOOD, and (2) I doubt this is more than a 10 oz serving. We started with a warm assortment of breads and in deference to my guest, we minimized the veggie's ordered. (I'll go back during baseball season :-) ) After ordering a glass of of the extensive, but reasonably priced wine list, we looked at dinner entree. The steaks come with a choice of rubs and sauces. The house rub was described as "cajun-style, but not overwhelming". My theory is sauces on steaks are useful for poor cuts of meat, but take away from great cuts; hence, I went no sauce. The result was an incredibly great dinner of Bone-in filets ordered medium rare, no sauce and a loaded mashed potato side. (This side comes pre-prepared or you can ask for ramikans of cheese, chives, bacon and sour cream and build as you like at the table. We finished with a scoop of ice cream and a cappuccino for desert. Excellent steak spot and a welcome high-end addition to the Scottsdale food scene.One comment: The "Branding" of the restaurant is confusing. Either call it "Dominick's" or "Lincoln Avenue", but not both. This actually caused confusion in trying to locate this spot and diminishes the feng shui and brand loyalty you'd want to keep and associate. (Qualifier: I'm not a branding expert and this is strictly my opinion.) I would love to see Mastro's try a southwest cuisine spot!~~#~1
Great theatre! Super clean and nice sound in all theatres. Only caveat: I can read the prices on the beverage and popcorn menu sign thing, so when I order a medium, I want a medium, I can see that for 50 cents more I can get the large. I just don't want to pee myself when I get caught up in a good flick. But thanks anyway.~~#~1
Aaron Has Been My Tattoo Artist for a long time and the quality of Aaron and all the artists in this shop are amazing very clean,sterile and safe. Be Back soon need some work done~~#~1
I am a huge fan of this place. I haven't ventured outside of the teppen tables, so my viewpoint may be limited. The atmosphere is quite loud and lively, but definitely fun. It is great for a nice dinner with a group. The food is simply outstanding. The soup, salad, and chicken are all excellent, but the fried rice is the absolute best. I have never had better fried rice anywhere. After you have enjoyed the main course, get the green tea ice cream. I hate green tea, but for some reason, this ice cream is amazing. If you like teppen yaki and don't want to deal with the bland food they serve at Benihana, definitely give this place a shot. You won't be disappointed.~~#~1
I like the idea of Sidebar, but I don't really love the place. The drinks are decent, so I would go there for that- though I just have never found it to be very fun. Once I went in and had an amazing bartender from Sanfrancisco- I really enjoyed that visit, but then the next time I had this bartender guy and he was really uptight and condescending whenever anyone asked him a question. It really bugged me, and it made it a less fun experience. I have never gone back.~~#~0
Wow, what a blast from the past!  I hadn't eaten at a Sizzler since it was popular in '80s, so when we saw that they opened up again where Taco Tote used to be, we had to go and check it out!When we walked in, it was like reliving my childhood, when we went to Sizzler as a special dinner, to gorge on the salad buffet and the unlimited fried shrimp.  Seeing that the salad bar itself was $8.99, and that for only a dollar more I could get a half dozen of fried shrimp, I figured I might as well!  The shrimp comes with your choice of side: either some incarnation of potato (fries, baked, etc.) or veggie (Such as steamed broccoli).  The shrimp looked just how they did in the '80s, pounded then battered and fried.  They were decent, nothing too special, but not bad.The salad bar has various salad greens, toppings, and dressings to choose from.  There's also an area with cold shrimp and halved avocados.  I was excited to see that they had such high quality items, but unfortunately the execution was something left to be desired.  The shrimp was deheaded, but whole, so if you wanted de-veined shrimp you had to de-vein them on your own.  The shrimp was also overcooked, and a bit tough as a result.  The avocado was a nice touch, but unfortunately many of them were slightly under ripe, so they tasted a little sponge-like rather than creamy.The hot foods section along the corner area of the buffet has items such as buffalo wings, meatballs in marinara sauce, and a taco bar.  There are also desserts here, like brownies, bread pudding, and soft serve ice cream with various toppings to choose from.  The taco bar was probably the best part of the hot bar.  There are various outer shells to choose from (Tostada, hard taco shell, soft tortilla, taco salad bowls), 2 meats (Ground beef and carnitas), and veggies (Such as pico de gallo, jalapenos, guacamole, cheese, lettuce).  There's also gooey nacho cheese and refried beans at the counter.  The carnitas was probably the best out of all the taco toppings.  It was slow cooked, and had a rich, deep smoky flavor.  Service was good, drinks were refilled and dirty plates were removed as needed.  One thing to note is that you cannot add tip to your receipt since you pay for your meal first, and then sit down, so cash will help for tipping your waiter!~~#~0
I got to stay here for work and had the best time! They have so many pools. I would spend my afternoons in the smaller pools and have the pool all to myself. It was great! They let me send free postcards which was fun, too. My room was beautiful. It was large and had great amenities. Food was disgusting though. I didn't have access to a car so I was pretty limited to eating hotel food for a week. Everything I ordered was gross and I tried it ALL!I thought customer service was fine--not great, just adequate.~~#~1
We went there yesterday a I enjoyed it. The atmosphere was fantastic, because they had a tv, plus they have a lot of pictures of Man V. Food, when Adam Richman came here. The service is good, because they waited for us to order, and were very patient.   I ordered the Jewish Slider like Adam did, but I didn't take the challenge. 1 order of Jewish SIiders are 3 sliders. The sliders were awesome. The meat was tender and really juicy. The cheese didn't really make a difference, it just added a little flavor, but the bun soft and chewy, and buttery which tasted like pancakes without syrup, and it was fresh. The potato pancakes put the lid on the jar. The potato pancakes aren't just a creative idea, it was very crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. There are 3 reasons why this isn't a normal slider. Reason number one is the Potato Pancakes, reason number two is the meat isn't a patty, and grinded beef that made that slider interesting. Reason number three is that the cheese is melted. REALLY melted. I will go again, because the sliders are amazing.~~#~1
Bison Witches is a bit religious for me.  The hearth is in Tucson, but they did a good job of transplanting the same food experience to Tempe. Their filling sandwiches offer a sort of primitive bliss with the roughly-cut thick slices of bread - best tip is to go with the half sandwich/half soup (their half is really a whole) - Their chili is the best thing going...~~#~1
Great iced tea. Terrific Roast Beef and mashed potatoes. Love the biscuits. You can't go wrong at Cracker Barrel.~~#~1
Wow!  This place completely rocks!  Very professional, courteous, and very good at what they do - make cars clean again.  The price was very reasonable and I will be back again many times over!  Thank you, Stewart Detailing!  Job well done.~~#~1
I got on the internet and looked at the menu and called in the order. I informed Brother's that I had a $3 coupon also and would pick up the perpperoni pizza and sampler and they said it would be 20 minutes.  At the register I was charged $12.95 for the $8.95 sampler.  I told the cashier that the internet menu had it listed for $8.95.  She just smiled and said "Oh, we get that a lot but we don't have a menu."  I said, "but it's on the internet with your address/web page"  and she said, "yeh, I know we get that a lot but here's our menu"  and she handed me their copy-machine menu which did not even have the sampler listed.  I politely told her that they should take the menu off the internet if it's not right.  The sampler was 4 pieces each of wings, mushrooms, cheese sticks, zuchinni.  The sampler was just like frozen generic small pieces "out-of-the-freezer-bag" deep fried.   I live near and our family had hoped to make this our weekly outing for pizza; however, I'll go elsewhere for better food and prices.  I also don't like false advertising.  A customer's frustration should be a business owner's learning opportunity to make their business better.  They can learn a lot from their customers.~~#~1
Awesome awesome awesome!!! Our table all ordered a 5 course tasting  and it was amazing!! The flavors pop in your mouth!! Very creative chef. I don't think there was one course we were disappointed in. By the end of the 3 hour dinner we had a total of 21 courses. Each one full of flavor making you want more. The staff was excellent, always there when you need them but not hovering. I would definitely go again. Pricey but so worth it!!~~#~1
If there was a Cantina Laredo in my home (Los Angeles) I would dine here regularly despite the multitude and variety of Mexican dining options.      Needless to say, when I'm in Scottsdale, I often find myself drawn to Cantina Laredo.  From the moment you're in, to the moment you're out, Cantina Laredo takes excellent care of your tastebuds.  The chips are salsa aren't filler but a real treat.  Their homemade salsas are worthy of bringing in your own jars to export back home -- some of my favorite salsa anywhere.  I believe they have three different kinds.  Their tequila options are wonderful allowing for creative margaritas or a fine neat glass of 100% pure agave goodness.  (I promise to never use that phrase again, sorry Readers.)The entrees aren't just your common taco/burrito fare.  Using juicy meats, creative homemade sauces, and interesting pairings, Cantina Laredo professes its love for Mexican food and culture -- reminding diners how lovable these things are.The decor and various areas are all quite nice as well.  An excellent complement to what always proves to be an excellent meal._C$~~#~1
It is a 110 mile round trip for me, passing who knows how many salons along the way, and it is well worth the drive even during rush hour. Ask for Ray if you want an amazing hair experience. You will go home feeling beautiful/handsome.~~#~1
I can't even believe I actually went to this restaurant.  My feeling was that if the Tommy Bahama clothing and its wearers were any indication of the dining experience, it was going to be unoriginal and in poor taste.  Alas my friend wanted to go there was his birthday lunch so....  Let me be clear that I'm not a food snob at all.  Just last week I enjoyed a lunch of Nachos Bell Grande and a bean and cheese burrito at Taco Bell very, very much.  That was far superior to this lunch at Tommy Bahama. The decor was comfortable and breezy.  Everything else  - not so much.  1st it's nice that they bring you bread and butter, but a sweetly flavored butter?  Why mess with the pure goodness of butter?  The glass of lemonade I ordered was sickeningly sweet, and I am a notorious for my sweet tooth.  It was undrinkable until I cut it with water.  The coconut shrimp also had an overly sweet sauce.  So much so that we could each only eat 1 of 6 shrimp.  I got the crab bisque which was crazy salty, and in my opinion, contained previously frozen hence rubbery crab meat.  As it was my friend's birthday, they brought him a complimentary dessert.  Very nice. He got the newest one which was some sort of chocolate/caramel-filled cake with oreo crust, chocolate mousse topping, sprinkled with crushed Heath bar.  Sounds good, right?  Vile, absolutely vile.  Overly sweet except for the oreo crust that was saturated in butter.  On an update note - it was not the nasty sweet butter they serve with the bread though.    My final issue was with our young, highly attentive server.  He was very sweet and well-intentioned.  However I feel that every server in the world needs to stop speaking to customers in the collective.  Don't say "are we enjoying our coconut shrimp?" or "are we ready for dessert?"  Unless I've badly misinterpreted our relationship, "we" aren't doing anything together. Just a pet peeve -  I still tipped him 22% and kept my mouth shut about this odd little quirk.  oh and the bill for coconut shrimp appy, quesadilla, cup of crab bisque, lemonade and glass of white wine?  $52.  for lunch.  Tommy Bahama and I just didn't work out at all.~~#~1
The food is as good as the Coronado location but the ambiance is seriously lacking. The inside had a funky smell so we opted for 100 degree heat and ate outside instead.The main reason for three instead of four stars is that they screwed up our order. Not a huge offense, you say? Well they put their uber spicy jalepenos on my toddler's quesadilla instead of on my burrito. They replaced it but still... Bottom line: their food is good- love the carne and pork. We'll eat here again but I'll be double checking to make sure the order is right.~~#~0
Came to Blanco Tacos during Restaurant Week 2009. The guacamole they served with the chips was so yummy! The flan was also delicious. I will come back just to eat the flan! The scene was pretty cool. Fun people watching environment.~~#~0
I love Harkins Theaters in general, but this one simply doesn't seem to be kept up as well as most. It's a little dingy, the bathrooms aren't typically in great shape, the screens themselves are good sizes and the chairs really are comfy, but the concession stand dosen't seem as clean as it should be and it typically has the movie theater sticky floor going on. Harkins AZ Mills really is A-OK, but there are enough other theater choices that I typically make this one my la~~#~0
Steve is one of the few shops that can still do a decent flat top.  He is in my neighborhood, so it is great for me - convenient.   Steve is personable and the shop is inviting.  I love the hot towel and back-vibrator massage.  I have been going to Steve for years, great service product!~~#~1
I love the Ranch Market!  The atmosphere is great, the produce prices are very reasonable, and the civiche is excellent! I never go down the center isles, as they appear to be filled with typical grocery store packaged foods  What makes Ranch Market special are the fantastic offerings all around the center isles.  Here is my advice:  First, make your way to the fresca bar to get a fresh fruit drink, it's just past the bakery at the front door.  After you pick up your favorite fruit drink head over to the grill for some carne asada street tacos, but only order two because you'll want to save room for the seafood bar where you will find a deliciouso shrimp ceviche at a very reasonably price.  I usually order a half pound of the regular shrimp civiche and a half pound of the civiche ensalda; eat a little at the bar on a tostada and take the rest home for lunch the next day.  Yummy!  After you have filled your belly with the tasty carne asada and civiche, stop by the tortilla factory to get some fresh tortillas to go and don't forget to hit up the bakery for hot cream filled churro for desert.~~#~1
Since the Gilbert location has closed. The Tempe location has had more things to offer. The staff has really stepped it up on customer service. They do there best on helping you find whatever it is your looking for.~~#~1
This club has great bands.  I saw 68 Guns and Metal Elvis here.  Also at the Metal Elvis show was a Van Halen tribute band called VH Too.  The music is top notch and it is usually not too crowded so you can go right up to the stage.  However, there are only a few tables, which is annoying if you need a place to put your drink or coat or something.  I also wish the ceilings were a bit higher.  Would be better if they could combine an indoor/outdoor area with the stage.  Overall the building seems cramped, small and old.  The prices are reasonable though.  The location is kind of strange however.  We took a cab there but when we wanted to leave we couldn't get one to come pick us up despite the staff saying they called one.  Finally we walked to a gas station and called from there.  This reminds me too much of Club Red.  Great bands, crappy club.  I hope that someone opens a brand new club for bands of this caliber.  Or else I will need to open one myself.~~#~0
Not a big fan of the Boba Tea House by Lee Lee. I like their decor, very hip. However, their milk tea mix was not that great. It felt like basic sugared water. I've had better ones over in Lollicup or Quickly in LA. It's a pretty busy location as it is next to Lee Lee's, but unfortunately they definitely aren't quite there yet with the competition.~~#~0
Wow... i don't think I've ever been in a more narrow place.. ever! but it was just perfect in ever way!!! They have tables along one side and a bar with tall stools along the other side... you can watch them make your food.... its like the food network... but live and you can smell it :) my coworker and i sat right in front of the oven... every time they would open the oven i would only get hungrier!! :) we could see all the fresh and yummy ingredients!! i had the Reuben (Pastrami, corned beef, homemade sauerkraut and Swiss with a side of 1000 island dressing) WOW... it was amazing... for their sauerkraut they use red cabbage... it was more sweet than bitter... and the crust of the pasty was flaky and buttery... so delicious!! and i honestly forgot how much i love corned beef! over all it was very rich... but great to share.... My Coworker had the Italian.. (pepperoni, salami, ham, mozzarella, basil, tomatoes and marinara sauce) it looked great... he loved it... you could see the fresh basil and tomatoes... it smelled divine we didn't speak for a full 20 minutes... just barley loud enough mmmmmmmms and o-m-g this is amazing... said quietly to ourselves.... all of the employees were so outgoing and laid back at the same time... just really cool guys... i loved the atmosphere and the attitudes that filled this place... i cannot wait to come back!~~#~1
Of the 3 sites - this is the Kindergarten.My daughter is attending here and I simply love it.  She's five and is repeating kindergarten.  She attended kindergarten last year early at the encouragement of her preschool teachers who thought she was bored in their classes.  We are having her repeat because she's a little young for first grade, but this isn't an issue because the curriculum rolls every two years for that very reason.  In her first year - she learned to read, write, do simple math, know all her sign language letters, and has more Spanish knowledge than I do.  this year they will build upon all of that and take her further.The staff is great and care a lot about the kids.  And when issues arise they  work with the parents to get them solved both at school and at home.It's pricey. But so very worth it.~~#~1
If you're heading to a show at the Scottsdale Center For The Performing Arts, this is your best convenient bet for dinner (if you like Indian food).  It's average but can probably satisfy your curry craving.~~#~0
LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! Had the buttermilk fried chicken with the mashed sweet potatoes and asparagus and it is to die for. Comfort food for sure. Not too crazy about their brunch menu because you must order off of that and not the regular menu. Their guacamole and warm chips are also a yummy must! This is a great place to take out of town guests because there is nothing like it anywhere else.~~#~1
Just returned from the Phoenix area and so my friend insisted we check this place out.  Well basically the place serves an alcoholic versions of "Slurpees" in a variety of flavors.  If you've been to Las Vegas it's the same as those slushy alcoholic drinks but made in a small Arizona-sized portions.I was ok hanging out on the patio but I don't think I would trek here as my destination.  The prices were ok as well as the scene.  In fact we saw a table of 8 people apparently just walk out without paying their bill so we watched half of the staff burst out the door running in different directions trying to apprehend the suspects.  Weird huh?~~#~0
Absolutely sensational food.  We had the evening buffett. I will be driving 40min one way to eat here again.  Wow I just really enjoyed my meal.~~#~1
I eat here frequently as I stay at the adjoining Hilton when I'm in town, and the breakfast vouchers are generous. The steak and eggs ($15) features a good cut of meat (I think it's a flank steak), 2 eggs anyway you want them, with corn salsa and toast and potatoes. The servers are always amenable to allowing me to change out the sides for lots of fruit. I love the mustard available at the table, the fact that they have Chilulah hot sauce on hand, and will bring out some salsa at no extra cost. The staff are pretty attentive.  I call ahead to avoid having to wait in the breakfast rush. I have also had an omelet which was substantial in size and quite tasty, with unlimited ingredients for about $12.~~#~1
My office moved to the area so I was driving around and saw the sign " Best Sandwich...." Um, no. If you want, I can come in there and show you how to cook a Chicken Cheese steak. First, don't wrap it up and let the sandwich sweat and make the bun soft and chewy. Second, put some meat on there. It was 50% bun.  It should be toasted and crunchy. And price, a 12" chicken cheese chips and drink was $13..are you kidding me. For that price, I was hoping for the best I ever had. Change it up Capriottis or the word will get out and it will all be over in this very tough market.~~#~1
I'm a big fan of Silver Mine. I have been for a long time. In fact, I would venture to say that this is my favorite sub place. Ever. I can't quite pinpoint what is so appealing about it to me. I do know that it was a dangerous decision to decide to live within a mile of this shop. The employees are super friendly, the restaurant itself is clean, the food is cheap and oh-so-good. Personally, I recommend the Pikes Peak or Bust which is a veggie cheese sandwich. I love it and have turned into the type of person that gets the same thing every single time...yikes! P.S...They also deliver until the wee hours of the morning and it doesn't get much better than a tasty sub when you have been out and about in Scottsdale on a Saturday night :)~~#~1
Cummings took over the company that we originally used, and since they have taken over we have had nothing but problems.I haven't seen a single bug in years in my house and as soon as we started using Cummings we've found a bug almost every single day and not just 'bugs' but cockroaches. I called Cummings to ask them about why this was happening and the receptionist was extremely rude saying they didn't do anything wrong. I would NEVER recommend this company to anyone. Needless to say I will be finding a new pest control company today.~~#~1
Andrea is absolutely wonderful. She's pet-sit for me several times over the past several years and I've never had a single issue. On her first visit she stopped by to meet the animals and go over details with me. Now I just call her to let her know the days I'll be away and she arrives without any problems. She's very responsible and trustworthy - her copy of my house key broke off in the lock and she called me right away and we figured out a solution. She even came by on a day she didn't have to in order to get it fixed - all of this while I was gone.  On another occasion my travel plans changed suddenly and she was able to continue watching my animals. I highly recommend Andrea as a professional house-sitter. She can't be beat.~~#~1
If you are a tea drinker, you have to stop by! The variety seems endless as you read over the menu so it really comes down to which tea fits your particular mood at that moment (mine right now is the "cookie monster" which is awesome!)~~#~1
For the past three months I've been receiving unsolicited spam text messages from these clowns, so regardless of how nice a place this might be, I'll never stay with them or any other affiliated property for that reason alone. I've complained to the hotel (I was blown off), blocked them from my cell phone account, and filed a complaint with the feds. So...since the hotel continues to find it appropriate to light up my cell phone at 3 am with spam texts, I hereby award them a generous one-star rating.~~#~1
I love this PHO and spring rolls, and for the friendly and fast service plus it's cheap! Oh it's truly a must try place.~~#~1
My wife raved about Delux. She said this was the best burger she's had in the area. I finally went with her and by no means was overwhelmed. The burger was fine, but not the BEST I've ever had. The burger was not much better than something you might get at Chilis, Red Robin Cheeburger, Cheeburger etc (my opinion). I think I actually would prefer a burger from these places over Delux.Maybe my expectations for this place and burger were set too high and I was disappointed with the final product.Pros:The sweet potato fries and dipping sauce was very good. The service was excellent.Cons:Limited seating and basically rubbing shoulders with the person next to you because you are packed in so tight. T the lighting in the bathroom is very dark. I'm shocked techno wasn't being played when I walked in. I didn't like the trendy nightclub feel of this place.~~#~0
The waiter got the drink wrong: "up" means served strained without ice, not on the rocks, but I was happy about the mistake, The Salmon melted in my mouth and the bread pudding made me fat for hours, but was so worth it.  Great atmosphere and none of our plates were empty when taken away.  I would definitely go back.  Good service, great food, fun atmosphere.  Great flexible hours on a Sunday.  GO !~~#~1
If you go prepared and early, you can be in and out within an hour. If your not 100% sure what you need, go online and check BEFORE you go. Save yourself the time and hassle of making that second trip. Not bad overall.~~#~0
We tried the caviar before our appetizers this time, a choice between two types - we picked the Osetra.   Caviar is served with mini toasts,  minced shallot, minced hard boiled egg white, minced hard boiled egg yolk, capers, creme fraiche, and I'm sure I'm forgetting other items served with it.  What a treat.  As usual, we enjoyed chopped salad, fillets, scalloped potatoes, asparagus, espresso, butter cake, and a fantastic Cabernet.Another A++ experience at Mastro's!!!!!~~#~1
I created a monster when I brought my family to Chipotle for the first time many years ago. I am constantly taking one for "the team" when I am dragged here by my wife and one of my sons. I usually get the carnitas tacos with the salsa that has the little tomatoes, onions and cilantro. I even pony up an extra $1.80 for the guacamole. I just wish there was the option of adding tomatoes to your taco without the onions and cilantro. How can you eat a taco without tomatoes and guacamole?~~#~0
After a movie at AMC, my mom, dad, aunt & I decided to have an early dinner here. I have been here a few times in the past but it's been a good 3-4 years since my last visit. I forgot that they have paper on the table so you can doodle on it. That's always fun. Our server was Dan & he was really friendly.For starters we ordered the calamari, by we I mean my mom because she orders calamari whenever we go out. It was good & so was the dipping sauce. Their rosemary bread is tasty too, especially with a lil olive oil. My dad ordered red wine (not sure which 1) & I ordered the ultimate leaning bellini. Dad enjoyed his wine, had 3 glasses & I loved my cocktail, so yummy! For our entrees: my aunt-shrimp portifino, dad-aged beef tenderloin spiedini, mom-originally wanted lasagna but they were out for the next hour, ugh, so she settled for chicken scaloppine & myself-lobster ravioli. My aunt loved hers, dad liked his, mom didn't care for hers & kept eating off of our plates & I liked mine as well. Not sure how authentic their Italian is, but hey we overall enjoyed our dinner & would definitely return!~~#~0
Lolo's is one of my favorite places to eat in the valley.  Their dining room is very small and sometimes there's a long wait at the door but their staff is always super friendly and there for you if you need anything.Things I've tried there:LoLo's special which is 3 piece of chicken with 2 waffles, Stupid fries, side of potatoes smothered, Chyna's honey hots (which are their hotwings), Ivan's chorizo and eggs, and their banana cream pudding.Their chicken is perfectly cooked.  Nice, crunchy, juicy, and very flavorful.  Their waffles are fantastic as well, but my all time favorite has got to be their Stupid Fries.  It's a basket of freshly cooked french fries smothered in gravy with bits of bell peppers, onions, and chunks of their fried chicken.  I have no idea how they do it but even though their fries are smothered, it stays extra crispy under all that sauce.  That's what makes it so darn delicious.  It's definitely a meal in itself.  Their banana cream pudding is so large you guys can share it.  Banana cream anything is one of my favorites so of course I would say that it was amazing!!Their koolaide are awesome as well.  You can't come here and not have their koolaide.  I love their blue but I sometime switch it up to red.  My fiance and I have tried their Scottsdale location as well but I feel that the cook at the Phoenix location (which is the original) has got it down packed.  My food always arrive and taste just as good as the last time as to their Scottsdale location, the food doesn't taste the same to me.  Maybe I'm just trippin' but that's how I feel.  Overall, this place is pretty awesome.  I can't wait for them to finish their expansion.~~#~1
That's Amore is awesome! I'm glad to see that a nice, clean and friendly local place is being supported and recognized. It deserves the five star ratings- the gelato tastes fresh and you really experience all of the flavor. It's a nice place to ride your bike to and get a refreshing treat when it gets hot.~~#~1
When I met some friends for dinner at this restaurant at the end of October, I liked it so much that I made a mental note to write something later.   I've just signed onto Yelp, and this is my first review.Our group of friends hadn't seen each other for a while.   Busy catching up, we didn't open our menus for quite a while.  I was impressed that our waitress (her name might be Mel) kept coming back in the nicest way to check on us, but didn't interrupt our conversation.   She kept letting us know that she was ready when we were.  When we were finally ready to order, she asked:  "Separate checks?"   Terrific.  That was exactly what we needed.I hadn't expected to like the food, because I had heard and read that it was all the  high-calorie "comfort" variety.   It was a nice surprise that I was able to get low-calorie substitutions for the sides that went with my entree.Overall, it was a very nice experience.~~#~1
Although they didn't have what I was looking for, the help was friendly and the store was very nicely kept. And they had a decent selection of course everything is a dollar. So I said " you guys are okay in my book (A-OK) one of the good ones" so I won't rule them out when I'm looking for dollar deals.~~#~0
No bad for a chain.~~#~0
It is a total dive bar...If you need a drink go get one.  There are pool tables, shuffle board, video game or two, and a jukebox.  The bartenders know their stuff.  Enough said!~~#~0
Great food and service. It will only be for special occasion for us because its pricey, but it is worth it. They made us feel special.~~#~1
I like frozen stuff. Ice cream, frozen bananas, mountaintop snow, icebergs, glaciers, frozen caveman lawyers - all good.A friend introduced me to Golden Spoon this afternoon. What a great treat! They have convenient little portions for the sensible and great big portions for the more gluttonous. It tastes great, costs little, and really hits the spot.~~#~0
Friendly group. Great specials....Try THE BASIC breakfast. It's more than enough.~~#~1
with airlines, always hit or miss. delta by far my worst experience on one flight, excellent on the next. american airlines....for our most recent vacation, just run of the mill. we were boarded quickly and efficiently. in the turks and caicos, our flight was cancelled due to a mechanical issue, but then we got to spend an extra night at the Beaches resort (free food and alcohol anyone). although it did take them 5 hours in the crappy providenciales airport to let us know the flight was cancelled, but 30 minutes later, i was happy as a pig in slop with 2 mixed drinks in my hand and 3rd on the way, with 4 or 5 more to go. airlines...unless you're in first class, you're nobody.~~#~0
The food is good, but I think the prices are too high for what you get.  Considering there are plenty of other places to go for good subs, salads and fruit platters that would be much cheaper, it's hard to choose Duck and Decanter over them.However, I will go here when I don't have to pay.  Why not, right?~~#~0
I'm very happy that I called Enterprise Pools.  They have friendly service and worked with my schedule when I asked for an estimate.  Mike was knowledgeable and quickly determined what the problem was and even told me how I could fix it.  He offered service at a reasonable price and never tried to sell me something for the sake of sales.  It was definitely a relief to find an honest business man after dealing with sub par service from Leslie's for such a long time!~~#~1
the food is decent and fairly cheap. The only complaints I have about it is the place is pretty small and can get crowded, they don't serve liquor (eh, but there is a liquor store next door, so I can eat and then get a beer, but sometimes it's nice to have a margarita with your burro) and not always, but sometimes one particular lady that works there can be kind of rude and can mess up your order. Though I do enjoy their food and it's within walking distance of my residence.~~#~0
I really wanted to like this place.  For starters, I paid cash for my take out. I was owed back five dollars and was told " we don't have enough change". So I had to settle for $2.50. What kind of restaurant doesn't have proper change?  Especially on a Saturday night.       The food:  Chicken lettuce wraps had a strange fishy taste. Gave up on them after a few bites.  Vegetable chow mein:  In my opinion, a broun sauce is thick and flavorful. This one was very liquidy and flavorless.  Dumplings were edible at best.      Do yourself a favor and stick with China Chili.~~#~1
I read about Scramble on line so I thought I would go there for brunch and I loved it!! The Santa Fe eggs Benedict are amazing! The staff is friendly and the ambiance is incredible. I would highly recommend this place to anyone!!!~~#~1
I use to LOVE Kazimierz so I am trying to be fair in giving it 3 stars.  Most of my experiences have been 4 stars but the last two visits here have been a 1 or 2 star so...Kazimierz is a hidden, fantastic wine bar in Scottsdale, which use to be very intimate and was a great spot to cozy up to a date.  Lately though they have been packing people in to this awesome bar which has so much potential.  It's elbow to elbow now, with pretty bad service but still a great wine selection.  I'll still come here whenever I'm visiting the area because I have a soft spot for it, and I am hoping it returns back to the awesome, secret cozy wine get away it use to be, and I know in the area, there isn't really any other spot, no matter how bad the service, that compares to it.~~#~0
Unfortunately Out of Business.~~#~1
The coffee at this location is awful- please go get lessons from the lady at the Thunderbird and 40th street location.However, the primary morning guy, Shawn, is awesome. He is friendly and chipper, but not so much so that he's annoying as your first human contact of the day. He is generous with the toppings and speedy.~~#~0
This place has NO clue when it comes to pricing men's items, and I would not recommend them at all.  I consigned a leather briefcase worth close to $600, and they priced it for $90, giving me a whopping take-home of $40.  I understand the need to move merchandise quickly (and naturally, this sold in a matter of days), but cannot fathom why they would not attempt to get more money for the item.  I can only assume they did not do their research before setting the price.  Consigner beware!~~#~1
Tried a little if everything.  The bars are worth the drive across town unbelievably good.  The bars have a moist short bread crust, it is absolutely addictive.  The strawberry cupcake was perfection.  Cookies were very good but the bars and cup cakes stole the show.  Thank heavens it is not closer to home :)~~#~1
This place makes me want to learn German every time i go.I would get my Polka clothes out any day of the week.Great food, great prices, great atmosphere.The fall months are great to sit outside and enjoy the weather to a Brat sampler.  LOVE IT!~~#~1
I love this place!!! OK. where do I start.. Great place to stop in for a quick lunch. AMAZING outside grill, everything is good. Best cheeseburger I've ever had. I don't even like Salmon and theirs is good. Good salad bar and salads ( pasta, tuna etc..) The pizza and sushi.. again amazing!! And........ they have about 10 different iced teas to choose from. Also, they have a great breakfast. Omelet station and all. I suggest the chorizo and egg burritos. GREAT outside patio~~#~1
Currently having a liquidation sale, but it's not really worth the trip.  I found that most books were cheaper at Amazon then the sale price.  A few were even cheaper at Barnes and Noble then the liquidation sale price!  Which just made me say to myself well that's probably why you're going out of business try some competitive pricing!  The place is an absolute disaster they've moved a lot so the sales staff doesn't even know where everything is.  Also the place just smells dirty and old, it's very unwelcoming.  It's really no surprise to me they couldn't get customers before.~~#~1
Unfortunately I don't get enough chances to come here but, I'd say I have been here about a dozen times and each time I have never been let down.  The beer is great, the food is great, especially their french fries and the crowd is OK.  Yes it is in Tempe and you're stuck with all the ASU kids but I like to come here in the summer time or when ASU is on break because it is the locals that are here.  It is not the nicest brewery that I have ever been to, but what they lack in aesthetics they make up for in beer.  A must go to place if you're in the Tempe area!~~#~1
Love this place.  Bring some patience because the wait is sometimes long and there is little seating.  The outside patio is excellent in the fall and early spring!But I gave it 5 stars for a reason - and that is because the awesomeness of the food absolutely outweighs the wait time.  I acknowledge that this is a personal choice - but if you go and try any of the sandwiches, you'll likely agree.~~#~1
Absolutely incredible. It appears the young lad who works here seems to be the go-to front-desk man everyday for this shop. He was very helpful and told me exactly what my shoes needed and didn't suggest pricier repair options that my shoes really weren't in need of! I brought in two pairs of dress shoes; one of which I had the heels replaced ($22, free shining included) and another just for shining ($8) and they made them look near-brand new again! I will certainly be bringing all of my shoes in for repairs/cleaning within the near future to this fantastic little shop!Keep singing,-Jerron~~#~1
I'm a regular at Lux. Haven't reviewed it out of sheer laziness. And it's usually laziness that brings me here: when I have a major thingie to get done by Day B but I spent all of Day A at the office surfing the Internet instead of working on it, I pay the price with an all-nighter, which I like to start at Lux. (Damn them for not being open past 10). This is usually the story when anyone spots me here. I'll grab a small table for myself, plug in my laptop (free wifi), spread out my papers everywhere, then go up to the counter for a large and extremely delicious Velvet Latte. When it's done right, there's a perfect swirl of white cream that forms the shape of a leaf on the surface of the caramel-colored coffee. Mmm.Since I am ADD I take frequent breaks of course. Like every 3 minutes. Whenever I hear a strange piece of music I really like that I've never heard before (this happens often), I strain to catch part of the lyrics, stick it into Google, find the name of the band, stick it into iTunes and download it. I'm not making that up. Like half my music collection was created through this method. The last few bands I downloaded tracks from are... let me open up my iTunes... Kasabian, Feist, and the Detroit Cobras. I'm not even remotely hip enough to have heard of those before on my own.~~#~1
Sam's Club is having a ground beef recall. Call the store for details.  I am just all about the FYI today! ;-)They said they sent paper and electronic mailers - but I did not get one. I just got lucky and happen to be returning the brown ground meat that I just bought.I am rarely able to find fresh ground meat or chicken here, but their roasts have always been fresh and very reasonable. I can get double the size here for the price I would pay (for a smaller one) at Fry's. And, if it is not quality meat, just return it for a 200% refund = one of the only reasons that I will try to get meat here. Although, for the hassle, it is really not worth it. Also, if for any reason you don't like the club itself, they will refund your membership. Look it up; it's on their website.They are trying - but be wary of the ground meat and chicken there. It is often not very fresh. But.... I can sometime find fresh ORGANIC produce here - nothing much really - last time it was spinach. It was really cheap however, and getting organics at wholesale prices is rare.~~#~0
I give this place NO stars. They have karaoke which would be good except for the co-host is NASTY! The rest of the bar is typical with darts, pool and poker. The food SUCKS! don't bother to go here unless you like being whined at by a wussy faggot at night long. I know that is harsh but the co-host really is nasty.~~#~1
This is my favorite seafood place in Phoenix!!!! I have loved this place since it opened when I worked at Nordstrom years ago!  They have a great happy hour.  There are not many places that you can get a $5 cosmo, appletini, and lemon drop martinis...not many!!  They are not Grey Goose martini but they are delicious all the same!  They offer greta choices from their menu on their happy hour menu as well...of course they have a fabulous happy hour its because its the same owner as Roaring Fork and their happy hour is to die for...Anyways...their menu...The potstickers are just something different that you would not expect...and they are delicious!  I love the crab cake too!  A guilty pleasure is the bacon wrapped shrimp with goat cheese and the onion rings!! OMG!!  I cannot get enough of the lobster tacos too!!  I could just have the appetizers for dinner!  I do often!  Also, I love the Fuji Apple Salad because the candied walnuts just make you want more and more and more...the dressing just tops it all off...Now the entrees that I love are the Crab stuffed shrimp with the vinaigrette...It is FABULOUS!!  Of course...if you love lobster tail this is the place to get it!  You get two of them!  Now make sure that it is the right season because they are not cheap, but they are so worth it!The sides to get are the twice baked potatoes, truffled mac and cheese, and sauteed spinach!  They are fantastic!~~#~1
I am for out of town and came here to celebrate my Birthday and it was a blast. The food was delicious and our Tepenyaki chef Robert was hilarious and very on point. This place is definitely a must when going to Scottsdale. I do go to Arizona a lot and will definitely be back soon.~~#~1
I had several mothers tell me about Eduprize and how great it was. I was a little nervous when I was told there is a waiting list and you have to agree to put time in the classroom. Now that I am in the classroom volunteering, I realize why it is so great. I can see first hand why my daughter struggles in some areas and does great in others. I can see how the others are struggling too and I can be apart of helping them, even if it is just for a day. This school's requirement to have parents volunteer is something ALL SCHOOLS SHOULD DO!~~#~1
This is your run-of-the-mill sports bar that caters to the not-so-blue-collar 30something crowd of Chandler.  The ambiance is nice, darker, big screen TVs everywhere... the waitresses are attractive (a staple at these types of places) and they are friendly and attentive... ours was on this very day.  It's Beer Week in AZ this week and they had just hosted a SanTan event (pub crawl) today as part of Beer Week, so they were understandably out of SanTan Devil's Ale and the place was quite quiet when we arrived at 5pm. We got seated at the patio where the have a nice little Bocce ball area and it was nice to enjoy the great Phx February weather.Alright, so we ordered burgers as we were both in the mood for a sizable piece of beef, hopefully topped with bacon and other yummies.  They did a pretty good job for being a sports bar, but not impressive. They claim their meat is fresh ground, though when that's the case, the patty has a different type of form and is less flat and compacted.. okay, maybe they grind it in the AM and then stockpile patties for the day.. that's fine.  The bacon (I ordered the #9 All Star - cheddar, bacon, beef) was lame... thin, a bit stale-tasting, and not crispy.  The cheese was fine.  I did like that the meat was char-broiled and so it has a good taste to it.  Also, the inside wasn't over cooked and the bread they served it on was kinda sweet and giant... tasty, actually.The sides were blaaaah.. cole slaw was really boring and had literally 3 ingredients (white cabbage, carrots, sugary mayo) something I would expect from Chili's or Denny's.Well, the burger hit the spot but the rest was plain and boring.  The Stella was not as cold as I prefer.  Our staff was very good.  So far, an OK place to visit, but a 4 star place is somewhere I will likely go out of my way to visit.. this didn't make the cut.~~#~0
I'm married to a Japanese and work for Japanese company. I've been to Japan I don't know how many times and have eaten well there. This is simply top class, I'd even say special. The style is a kind of fusion ranging from basically pure Japanese to Japanese with some very tasteful western inflections. I'm not in Phoenix often. But this will be on my list every time I go if I have anything to say about it.~~#~1
I love their menu!  The garlic mashed potatoes-amazing!  Steak-melts in  your mouth!  Service - great!  Big fan of Applebee's!~~#~1
Yes, it is probably as good as it gets for a SANDWICH place. Very tasty. All 3 of us liked our different sandwiches. I also ordered pasta salad but it really was not any good, but it does not matter as i did not come there for a pasta salad. Real good besides that.~~#~1
I am proud to say that I sent Kristin S. here for her awesome hair transformation (8 inches is a lot, girl!) I just had my second hair cut here today, and I was just as happy this time as I was the first time around. First of all, the service is top notch - they take care of you quickly, kindly and enthusiastically. They are not snobby, which is a welcome relief when living in Scottsdale. I have always felt welcome and comfortable here. Moreover, the prices are amazing! I have very easy and basic hair, and they charge me $45 for a hair cut - if you want to spend more, you certainly can, but I am fine with the "stylist" level (who charges $45). In Tampa I paid more like $65, but I much prefer Par Exsalonce. This place is a well oiled machine, and they know how to run a salon. They carry B&B products, which are fun every once in a while.I really love this place and will not look for another hair place in the Valley. This place knows how to treat customers, style hair and create a pleasant experience. The Market Street location is a bonus, too, because you can even do some damage shopping when you bounce out with your new 'do.~~#~1
I still really love coming to LGO...especially to relax on their patio with some good food and good drink. I love that LGO sells Framboise and I love the hectic and busy atmosphere. HOWEVER, the time has come for me to drop a star. I am a regular fixture at LGO and lately have noticed that they seem to be running out of some of my favorite items on a regular basis. For example, the MJ Cookie...it is one of the few items that makes my mouth water at just the thought of it. It's like a brownie and cookie rolled into one. So heavenly. Unfortunately, LGO has been out of the MJ Cookie 4 out of my last 5 visits. And these visits are at all different times of the day/week. I know they get busy and I know a restaurant can run out, but it seems to happen so frequently and every time it's a big, BIG let down. And sadly, the cookie is not the only item that they run out of regularly. Lately, I've had a hard time finding the pre-made salads that I like too.My other issue just occurred and I cannot seem to pull myself out of the depression that it has caused. They no longer serve the green chile mac and cheese! Seriously. When I stopped in recently for lunch, I was so disappointed that this has been removed from the menu that I thought about walking out. I know that seems like a silly reaction to macaroni and cheese, but their green chile mac and cheese was by far one of the best items I found on their menu. Their sandwiches are tasty, but almost impossible to hold together. Their pizzas have great fresh ingredients, but always seem to be lacking something. And now this...no more mac and cheese. And they're always out of MJ cookies! It is a sad sad day at LGO. =(~~#~0
Sure the place has atmosphere and a good drink menu, but I prioritize the eats. We went on a Monday night for a friend's birthday with a semi-large group and they did a prixe-fix menu. I left hungry after paying more than the meal deserved. The bad: Shumai was just ok, duck mint salad had an unharmonious flavor and I refused to eat it, chicken with wasabi sauce was dried out, lychee wrapped bacon was soggy and a strange proportion, cream and goat cheese dessert with peach was not fun. The good: the Hong Kong rice noodles and fried tofu with pinapple sauce were the highlights and only things I would eat again. They were really tasty. But I won't be eating them again, because I don't plan to go back. I'm sure there's some gems here, as we found a few, but I need a better batting average and, oh, I dunno, to leave full with a few bucks left in my wallet?~~#~0
How could you not love this place?  Not only is the food fantastic and consistent, it has a great atmosphere and an adorable "grocery" shop next door.  It's a great place to people watch!  (Don't forget to check out the wine section--not only is the wine random, it's affordable and a great conversation starter with all the cute names and labels)After moving here from San Diego, I've been so unimpressed by all the breakfast spots in Phoenix.  This is the one place that I LOVE!  I think it offers something for everyone, however my go to is the Venice Beach Burrito.  It's such a casual spot--you order from the counter, find a table, and wait for them to call you to let you know your food is ready to be devoured.  There's tables both inside and out, and you can peruse the store while your stomach rumbles!The only thing I've ever been disappointed by is the sangria, but then again I'm not a huge fan of white sangria.  I will not be ordering it again but I have girlfriends that love it.I had never been here for lunch until this past weekend--it was always my late morning brunch spot.  Technically, I believe its a pizza place, but I've never had a pizza.  Although, they look quite good!  I ordered their tuna sandwich this past weekend, which came with a side of fruit and pickles.  The bread was thin and grilled panini style, and the tuna salad definitely did not disappoint!~~#~1
I will never go back to this establishment because all of the bouncers and wait staff are unfriendly, unprofessional and disrespectful.~~#~1
I think my fellow Oreganymphos would agree; this is single handedly one of the greatest places on earth to gorge yourself with some of the most delicious pizza, pastas and desserts AZ has to offer. If you wanna take my word for it, dont even look at the menu and order my usual orgasmic order:Appetizer: CalimariDinner: Big Rig Pasta w/ Chicken Dessert: White Chocolate Chip Macadamian Nut PazookieFYI: Whenever your taste buds feel like going on a culinary roadtrip, make sure you hit up any of the various Oregano's locations located around the state; my personal favs are the Flagstaff and Tucson locations.~~#~1
I finally tried Spicy Pickle last week. I like the name and was intrigued about their menu. Paninis, soups, salads, pizzetas, nothing out of the ordinary. I had a half sandwich ( Sausalito Bandido?), half salad combo( Spinach salad). Food was fresh and good. The sandwich could have stand a little more meat, it was truly flat. The salad was crisp and dressing was on the side, which I appreciated.  On my way out I got a chocolate chip cookie that was OK. I love cookies and they have to be pretty bad for me not to like them. This one, I kid you not, must have had maybe 3-4 chocolate chips? So if you're craving chocolate, this is not the cookie for you.~~#~0
On an evening walk through Roosevelt row during the monthly First Friday event, I overheard what could only be Jazz funk pouring out from the door just up the way. I walked by and someone sitting out front invited us in for a listen to their free music event. Once inside, the wife and I were greeted by the snack bar ladies asking us if we would like one of their cookies, candies or sodas in the bottle; we got a diet coke for a $1. The Nash a decent sized venue with about 12 or so four seat tables to sit at, none of which are particularly better than another, with the tables in front being the only exception. The music was good, if you like Jazz music as I do, but I think the band playing this night put together an oddly slow paced set with more of a blues and 'experimental' Jazz than I would have liked to hear. From the amount of people walking out during their set, seemed like others also harbored the same opinion. I usually like my jazz with a little side of funk; a thick base line, Jazz guitar, and complimentary piano and horn of some type. We stuck around for about 5 songs and decided to move on. It was First Friday after all.This place could really use some Kool, and maybe even the Gang. I imagine the music is subjective and changes on an event by event basis. I feel they really could step up the quality of foods, snacks, and drinks. The venue seemed more like it catered towards a teenaged crowd, especially considering their food choices were chips, candies, etc, and no adult beverages in sight. Although I can't see many teenagers running out to listen to a night of Jazz, I could be wrong though.If I find that someone worth listening to is playing at The Nash, I will likely head out again; but I don't think I would plan on just dropping in randomly for an evening of Jazz.Happy Yelping Phoenix. I can't get enough of that funky stuff!~~#~0
I hate being disappointed by bars bragging about their "huge" number of taps... while I can't dispute that they have 52 beers on tap, I can tell you that very few of them are worth drinking.. and that the prices here are on the ok to high side... I would never come back if it's not happy hour or late night pricing. I asked general questions about not discounted pricing, nine dollars for a Manhattan made with Jack Daniels and beers ranging from five to seven dollars... if I'm paying seven bucks for a pint at a sports bar in Tempe it had better be something from Russian River or a Stone anniversary brew... and a nine dollar Manhattan seems out of place... this isn't Scottsdale or a hotel bar.   Well the good news, Thirsty Lion is quite lovely inside, plenty of seating and dim lights, really not a bad place to relax and mellow out. Plus, the food was great, everything we've had has been very tasty, now it's all been off of the happy hour menu, but that's the only time I'll probably be here, the scotch eggs are delicious and my main recommendation. I'm hoping that in time prices will drop a bit and more craft breweries will get represented, but aside from the nice interior and spot on happy hour menu, Thirsty Lion just doesn't stand out enough to steal me away from Boulders or Taste of Tops...~~#~0
Best chocolate ever!  I tried Leonidas for the first time in Europe and have been looking for it ever since in AZ.  I'm so surprised they opened a store here, would recommend it in a heartbeat.  Also, staff was very friendly, a great place to get gifts!  I just got an assortment of chocolates and was very happy with my choices. The banana creme was surprisingly good and so was the champagne flavored...~~#~1
We have been here several times and each time has been excellent. Our first time was in Hawaii and we were happy to see one in phoenix.         Me and my Fiancee had a four course Valentine's day dinner here. Dinner was great.  Food was timed right and our server was on top of it.   Our server sent us a personal handwritten post card thanking us.  Dinner came to be a little over $200 with drinks, so yes its pricey, but my fiancee and I loved it so it was worth it.~~#~1
This place was just 'eh' to me!  I was just whelmed, not over or under!  The service at the bar leaves little to be desired!  I am not sure what it is about Scottsdale restaurants thinking they have to be snobby to people.  We ordered drinks from an un-friendly bartender and then waited another 20 minutes to even be acknowledged again!  The food was ok!  The bf had the berrimundi which he liked but wasn't wild about the side it came with.  I had the meatloaf, which was good.  The gravy and mashed potatoes had a great creamy flavor.  My sister had the lamb burger with fries that were cold and not very tasteful.  There is not much on the wine list either.I probably would not come back here because I dont think it was worth the hour wait for the crappy service at the bar.  I would rather venture down the road to Olive and Ivy.~~#~0
Back when I lived in Phoenix this was one of the only places I bothered with eating at. Started by a Chicagoan who moved to Phoenix, they get deep dish right and make just about everything else in the style of delicious. I was in town last week to hike the Grand Canyon and stopped in. Man, I miss their food. Thank God I live in Chicago and can get something similar! Be warned though. Their food is BIG.~~#~1
Consistent offerings of service, food, atmosphere and drinks is what makes this franchise successful. No matter whether I've been to Fogo in DC, Baltimore or here in Scottsdale, I get the same gut-busting food and well-made drinks in a place where I could either wear a suit and tie or jeans and a t-shirt.A specific note on this particular location- there were a lot of families with small children on this particular Friday night. No judging, but I've never seen that at any other Fogo. Fogo back east is really "date night" or the kind of place to pre-game for a bachelor party or a business dinner, but not to bring infants and toddlers. Possibly a by-product of its location on Scottsdale Road in a strip mall near a few hotels. IMHO, this is not the place to bring kids, but I respect the rights of anyone to do so. If I was traveling w/ kids in tow and I didn't have a Fogo in my city, it'd be hard to pass up. In any regard, it did not bother me in the least. I was too wrapped up in my company and the food and those drinks. You will easily spend over $75 per person here including tip, so prepare to camp out, eat slowly, enjoy your meal and be treated like royalty.The house special sirloin will make you rethink how to prepare sirloin at home, it's that good. Don't fill up on salad at the salad bar- you can do that at Olive Garden- but do enjoy the cheeses, mushrooms, vegetables and cold cuts which raise the salad bar. Did you see what I just did there?Nice wine selections here. Ask for a Brazilian red to enjoy with your meal if you have the coin.~~#~1
Let me first say if I could have given 0 stars I would have.My wife and I went to this place and were EXTREMELY disappointed. We had gone to a different Pancho's many years ago and were hoping it would be like that. The choices were very very limited and basic. There are so many amazing Mexican dishes yet my only choices were a tamale,taco and some horrible tasting enchiladas. How does a Mexican food place not offer burritos...have you guys heard of a bean burrito? Its pretty popular and would be a good choice to offer.The only food here that is worth eating is the baby churros and the Sopapillas, which actually were good. Unfortunately I didn't go to this place to pay $20 so my wife and I can eat Sopapillas. Please listen to my advice when I tell you to avoid this place. Take your money to taco bell and get a lot better Mexican food at a fraction of the cost.~~#~1
Their frozen drinks carried me through last summer. They have free air (for your tires) and water (for the radiator) at every location I've ever been to. Their hot sandwiches, though greasy, aren't TOO greasy and actually taste like food. The coffee is pretty good, and they have more ways to tart it up than Starbucks does. QT frickin' rocks.And BTW, the QT stands for Quick Trip.~~#~1
North Glendale's cool new  hangout.  Formerly Cactus Willy's.  Completely remodelled!  Follow us on facebook at Justin Willys!~~#~1
Chicago style hot dog?!  Sign me up!  I just moved here from Chicago, and I've been dreaming of Portillo's since I left.  Where am I going to find something even close to that in AZ?!  I was hoping this would be it.  The hot dog wasn't that bad.  The fries on the other hand, weren't so good.  My husband ordered a beef with hot peppers (giardiniera), and they were far from hot...almost tasted pickled.  And the sandwich?  TINY!!!  It was like a 4" beef sandwich!  I didn't taste it, but he said that it just tasted like a roast beef sammy...not the Chicago beef that we are used to.  One of these days we'll find a decent "Chicago-style" restaurant out here in AZ.~~#~0
Very good place for breakfast and their pies are to die for.  We've been here about five times and they never seem to be crowded, which is a shame.  Their staff is always friendly and the food is always good.  It's like a Dennys-type place, but I think the food tastes better.  I've honestly never had a lunch or dinner item but I don't think that's what you go here for :)  The prices are very reasonable.  Once again, pies are TO DIE FOR! We've had their strawberry pie (x2), pumpkin pie, peanut butter chocolate pie and most recently, their mixed berry pie.  We're going to be moving across the valley and I'm actually a little upset this location won't be coming with us.~~#~1
The best breakfast place, bar none!  I love that it is a local, non-chain place and they do everything delicious!!  The french toast is to die for and the plain and simple (eggs, bacon, potatoes) is perfect!  My husband and I split these two dishes and it is plenty.  We always leave stuffed!!  Be sure to make reservations for a Sat or Sun morning breakfast, otherwise you'll be waiting at least an hour!!~~#~1
My husband and I eat out a lot and we had the best dining experience ever the other night! We sat at the bar with the bartender AJ and he was such a delight! We had happy hour which was probably the best deal in town! 5 dollar glasses of wine and half priced appetizers!?! My favorite was the steamed mussels. We loved it so much we also had dinner. The classic pasta deal was the best. Getting to take one home gives you at least two more meals, the next day. It's hard in this economy to get more bang for your buck but Maggianos they are doing it right! We will defiantly be back for more!~~#~1
My dear love and I went to the museum on a romantic date, and had such a lovely time. I hadnt been to the museum in years and it was a lot of fun to see some paintings I remembered from my childhood like the Frida Kahlo. They firefly room is utterly transporting as well. Frankly, I dont know if it was the art or my dear love that made the evening so wonderful, but we will go again soon. I strongly recommend a strolling date here. Wednesdays and maybe one other night are free. Oh and here's a tip-if you cant find a space, park across the street at the Viad Tower. Its free if you exit from the north side.~~#~1
This is a great dog park.  Plenty of grass to run around on, and there is always a good crowd to play with.  And drinking fountains and places to sit.  The majority of the dogs are nice, but there are a few Scottsdale poodles who think they are the shit and their owners just ignore their bad behavior.  I just stick my gum in their curly hair and go on with my day.The best part of the park is when I get home and the dog takes a nice long nap, and I can do chores in peace.~~#~1
Good food, but very expensive for a simple breakfast joint ($8-10 for most breakfast items). Also, the menu has very few healthy options...which isn't a problem for me, but is for my wife!  How about putting an egg white omelet on the menu?Seems to be family owned and does have a good atmosphere. But at these prices, I wonder how long it will be around. There were lots of empty tables on a Sunday morning, which has to be the bread and butter of a place like this.~~#~0
I was told to see Greg after a local shop diagnosed my exhaust problem.  He took a few minutes to look at my car, told me what I needed and what it would cost. I went back a week later, he did the work in the time he told me it would take and there was no surprises and my car is doing well. I would recommend this place over ANY muffler shop. Plus you support local business and not a chain.~~#~1
My experience here was awesome from start to finish.  I was greeted by an extremely friendly, smiling man (I believe to be the owner) who helped me with my order decision, took my order, then asked me to "please, sit down, be at home".  Awesome.I inquired about the salad and asked if they put any feta on the salad (they don't), he followed up informing me the sauce they serve has dairy, but that he would substitute garlic sauce instead.... now this might not seem like much, but to someone who has food allergies like myself, having someone with intimate knowledge of the ingredients and the care to make sure they don't serve you anything that might not agree with you is really a blessing and gives you assurance when you eat there.  Huge bonus.I had a half chicken shawarma and  half gyros plate which came with hummous, salad, rice, cucumber (substituted instead of pita since I don't eat wheat... nice touch) and a side of garlic sauce.  I do not normally enjoy chicken shawarma, but he insisted I try.  Well, he was right, I will say now I love chicken shawarma, Aladdin's chicken shawarma.  Their gyros was awesome too.. homemade, not the typical Kronos Meat Cone variety.  I paid after my meal and was welcomed back with a handshake.  Service was awesome, food was awesome, and they were able to easily cater to my picky food needs.  A+!~~#~1
I am disgruntled by the reviews I have read about Sapporo.  I have a few things to say.1.  I am tired of people complaining about the prices at Sapporo.    When you compare price vs. quality you will always be in a favorable position.  If you cannot afford Sapporo perhaps you shouldn't eat there. I am not trying to sound arrogant, but you truly get what you pay for.   Sapporo consistently prepares the best  sushi I have had in Arizona.2.  I understand wait time may be an issue.  I suggest that you arrive early and anticipate a wait.  Honestly, is thirty minutes on a Friday night going to bother you?  The food is well worth the wait.  3.  Please stop wearing flip-flops and bathing suits.  Perhaps this is the reason you are experiencing "rude" service.  A pair of jeans and a polo is fine.  Sapporo is a Phenomenal restaurant.  In my opinion, Sapporo serves the best Sushi in Arizona.~~#~1
I love Greek food, but I need to stop letting my friends drag me to this restaurant. The staff is extremely friendly and the place is comfortable, but for me the food is always a disappointment. I know I know, it's a chain... and maybe I just have high expectations, being that I'm from back east where we have small family-run Greek restaurants on every corner.~~#~0
Falafel is outstanding here, dark exterior with green interior, and a nice spicy peppery taste that is satisfying.  Cooked just right too for texture.  Fries are a nice side.  Prices reasonable here, plenty of parking, and a few atypical sodas available in the fridge.  Note that there's just a few seats inside, since this is also a grocery place.  To-go will probably be my main strategy for this great Falafel destination.~~#~1
When I'm casual but want to feel NYC I go to Christopher's.  We go here for a special occasion dinner or on the fly happy hour...which is the best HH food in town!  Let me repeat that - best in town!!!  Hamburger with truffle fries, brick oven pizza or a perfect salmon salad plus a beer or glass of wine for about $10/person. Can't beat it!  Sitting at the open kitchen makes me appreciate the setup and organization required to run a restaurant as well as the chef's tatts!?  If you dont want the blaring heat of the brick oven, don't sit at the corner next to it...Phoenix is HOT enough in the summer, so cool off and let someone else do the cooking!~~#~1
I love this store!  They have an amazing staff and the most modern clothes!  I set my appointments with a few of the employees and I always get compliments on my outfits when I go out!!  Hats off to the Ted Baker team in Scottsdale Fashion Square!~~#~1
This is our neighborhood restaurant.Whenever I want Margarita Sunrise and desserts, I went to Switch. I never disappoint.~~#~1
The best example North Scottsdale has of traditional Phoenix sonoran mexican food.  Los Olivos restaurants have been around forever - at least since the '60's.  The food is great if not fancy, and the place is pretty free of gimmicks.  You can get your fix of cheese crisps (aka quesadillas for you CA transplants), deep fried tacos, chimichangas, combination plates with so much sauce and cheese you can't tell what's underneath but it all works together to taste so good.  Los Olivos still plops down the free chips and salsa right when you sit down so you're good an full when that combo plate comes and glad for it.  The atmosphere is more like a nice mexican diner than mexican cantina and service is solid. They often have mariachis playing on weekend nights.  Margaritas aren't great, but the beer is cold.  Don't bother with dessert.  Cheap eats for all the food, especially since you won't be hungry for another 24 hours.  If you're in North Scottsdale and in the mood for traditional Phoenix style mexican food, Los Olivos is a great choice.~~#~0
I'd read about this place before (on blogs written by people from Utah) so when I was driving down Baseline and hungry and saw it I decided to try it out.It is set up a lot like Chipotle, however the process of ordering is somehow not quite as clear. Additionally I wasn't sure what went with my meal and what cost extra.That aside the salmon tacos I got were really tasty. I don't think I've had salmon as the fish in fish tacos at a restaurant before and I enjoyed the change.The price seemed a little high, but not so high that I won't visit again if I'm in Gilbert and looking for a quick meal.~~#~0
The Phoenix Art Museum was a day well spent. The atmosphere was inviting and it was like around every corner was a surprise waiting to be discovered. Admission was free for me. How you may ask? Our local library has cultural passes for various museums, try checking out your library next time you go. The museum was inexpensive adventure that took me across the world.  All the different exhibits kept me intrigued and interested. There were paintings, drawings, photography, and sculptures galore. There were even some animated pieces. I even stumbled upon a piece you could actually walk through. The layout of the museum is very easy to follow, as they give you a map and everything is labeled. You can go from the Asian culture, to English within a matter of feet. It is mind blowing. The whole world seems so much smaller, and it's brought together so beautifully.  They offer guided tours, or you can walk around by yourself. There is also a children's section to the museum. I have nothing bad to say about the museum itself. I am extremely happy that I went, and would recommend that anyone go. It would be a great date, or family day, or even a day by yourself. The Phoenix Art Museum is a place that I think everyone should visit while in Phoenix. It will really open up your eyes and make you think.~~#~1
As much of a sweet tooth that i have (dark decadent chocolate is my weakness)..Toffee was never my thing ,never on my mind ..And then i sampled Goodytwo's toffee ..wowzer !Sweet and salty toffee is regoddamndiculously good ..seriously good !They have a toffee topped popcorn ..these gals are killing me ..oh ,oh the twozels sinfully delish magical pretzel mix with kettle corn ,nuts and chocolate .Listen ,you can't put a price on happiness ,ha ha Everyone i love is getting their stockings stuffed with a box of salty-sweet love from Goodytwo's.Nothing more delicious or sexy ,ya sexy then a salty sweet combo ..it is a heavenly pairing ..Goodytwo's has perfected this,worth every penny !Rock on ladies !~~#~1
Doesn't get better than this, the guys at the Chandler Mall location do it right, every time!~~#~1
Whenever I start leaning toward being a vegetarian like my daughter is, I remember the smell and taste of that scrumptious, melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon at Durant's. And the hot fudge sundae for dessert? Dang, just can't beat it. The bartenders are old school--not too aloof, not fawning, just professional and classy. The best.~~#~1
Got to love the concept, coffee, art and a co-work space friendly for start-ups.  OSP has that feel of old college dorm meets painters loft.  The coffee is good, the WiFi is fast and the staff is friendly and they don't harass you, I couldn't ask for more to get work done!~~#~1
I came here on the opening night when someone from Gin Blossoms played on a makeshift stage, the beers were 25 cents and there was no food (but you know me, we ordered a pizza from a neighborhood pizza place.) Since then, they have added a full kitchen and the food is amazing (chicken strips that were designed for diners who appreciate tempura-like batter and are over the age of four), the beer is astounding (one word: Kolsch...makes me swoon) and the people are great. It's worth the walk wherever you end up finding a space to park--even better, ride your bike over like we do! The Sunday brunch is great. All of my friends sit and wish they had a student loan that would enable them to spend at least half of the day drinking here daily. I don't blame them.~~#~1
The classic example of why we need half stars.  Doesn't merit a four star endorsement but slightly better than the three star Meh.  The hot dogs are decent but you'd expect more due to the pedigree of the owners.  The place also doesn't feel well put together and like it's been neglected in recent times.~~#~0
I think the Living Room is fine! Like another reviewer said, it's nothing particularly exciting or mind blowing, but it is a nice neighborhood restaurant that has solid food. I like some of their bruschetta options more than Postinos. I do agree that the music is too loud! The atmosphere is more ambient and I wish the music was commensurate with that. I always forget my server's name but he is very nice and helpful - no complaints there!~~#~0
It is absolutely no fun to have a connection at this airport! It was definitely  not designed to be "post-911" friendly. Let me give you an example so that you will know what I mean: We fly in from San Francisco and are told that we will have to go to another building via a bus. We get off the plane and walk...and walk...and then walk some more, looking around trying to find where to go to in order to catch this bus. Finally, we found someone who told us where to go. We walked and walked, and then walked some more until we finally caught the bus. We then had to find the correct gate and go through security again... Flash forward 8 days. We fly in and go through customs. (This, BTW, was a great experience because we were the only international flight going through customs.) We rechecked our luggage and are told that we have to go to another building. Yep, you know what I am about to say...we floundered around, having to ask where to go several times. Finally, we found the right place and got on the bus. It then proceeded to go to various parking lots, dropping off and picking up other passengers. My husband and I looked at each other, worried that we were on the wrong bus. Since it was already 4 p.m. and we had not had lunch, we were getting very worried that we would not have time to grab lunch. Finally, my husband asked the driver and he indicated that we were indeed on the right bus. We continued going around parking lots until we came upon another bus. The driver told everyone on our bus that we could sit around and wait for 10-15 minutes, or we could get on the next bus and get there quicker. Of course, we all grabbed our suitcases and boarded the next bus, which proceeded to take us to the correct stop (after picking up additional passengers along the way.) Next ,we entered the terminal and jumped on an elevator to take us to the security line. There were only 2 lines and of course, we got in the line with the family who had to go back 6 or 7 times because they kept trying to go through the security line with belts on, shoes on, liquids in  their suitcases...you get the picture! Anyway, we finally got to our gate and were able to grab a slice of pizza before boarding our plane (not before enduring the antics of a 70-year-old United Airlines power-hungry granny who couldn't seem to get her act together, but was determined to show everyone who was boss...)~~#~0
One word to describe Over Easy: disappointing. It would've been an OK breakfast place if it wasn't for all the hype. I've been trying to visit this place since I found out it was on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, so when I saw the deal on Doozy of a Deal, I purchased it right away. I made my own omelette with chicken, garlic, and spinach. The chicken was overcooked and the omelette and my hash browns were terribly greasy. My cousin ordered The Wolfpack and was also disappointed with her meal. It just didn't seem up to par with a place that was on Food Network.The icing on the cake was the Over Easy Ice, their iced coffee. They could've given me a cup of water and cardamom and it wouldn't have tasted any different. We couldn't wait to get to the car to get some gum, to get the taste out of our mouths and even that didn't help. After reading other people's reviews, it looks like they hardly had any caradmom; so looks like Over Easy needs to figure out a way to uniformly make their coffee.Sorry Over Easy, you were quite disappointing.~~#~1
As a regular shopper of Last Chance, I must equally love The Rack. I am a cheap shopper, so Last Chance has the lower prices, but like I have said before, the product can be a bit beaten up. At The Rack it is a much more relaxed environment, way more organized, and the staff is so much more help full. I usually like to shop for shirts, dresses and jackets here. They also have a great selection of shoes, underwear, and pants, all a bit out of my price range though. Last week I found the greatest find! I found the best pea coat ever! It is black with double buttons and a belt, not too long and it has pockets in the perfect place. The best part, it was originally $160, their price was $59.95 AND all their wool coats we 25% off. Score! Now I will be warm in this Arizona winter. Haha Check them out. The parking lot can be crazy this time of year, but what parking lot isn't. There is a rumor that Santa is stationed right outside the store as well. :-)~~#~1
A bit slow for an airport setting and the staff were blaming each other for an order gone wrong for the customer in front of me...tacky.~~#~0
I've been here 3 times.  The first was fair, so I gave it another shot, second time fair again, third time (kyoto was closed soooo....) let me start by saying, I've been in the service industry for awhile.  I know the difference between good and bad service.  If they had been busy this would be one thing, but there was us and a few people at the bar.  NEVER HAVE I WANTED TO THROW MY BURGER AT SOMEONE AS MUCH AS OUR SERVER.  The server was an idiot and the food was ALL burnt... medium burgers are not CHARRED on the outside and RAW on the inside.  Steamed veggies are not CHARBROILED asparagus... everything was so horrible.  We didn't complain, but we did ask about the charcoal that was our veggies....  Which we were given a crappy attitude in response.  We weren't even looking for it to be taken off our bill, just a recognition that the food was TOTALLY burned and half our orders were wrong. BTW there was no offer made either to fix anything...  in times like these SERVICE SERVICE SERVICE AND QUALITY / CONSISTENCY will get you through.   if you don't know what a good meal is and you want to think you're cool cause you hang out in a place that looks like it was furnished by IKEA, you should try it.  There are better places to spend hard earned money.~~#~1
I think Zipps is alright. I fully remember this being the only decent restaurant near where I lived in North Scottsdale, so it was this or nothing.Food here is good, though they messed up my order and put sour cream on it...ew. But that's a common error, whatever.I'm not really a fan of sports, and it was loud in here, (which is to be expected), so that's not particularly my taste. However, I found it to be staffed with friendly people, which brings it from 2 to 3 stars in my book.~~#~0
I thought this place was outstanding! The staff was awesome, the food was excellent, overall appearance of restaurant was nice!~~#~1
We have been back several times since my initial review and the service and food have been consistently excellent for both lunch and dinner. Love their green chiles!!!~~#~1
Great beer, Good atmosphere, Non annoying music and great wait staff make this my favorite place to spend an evening.~~#~1
First, I'm a regular here. Sunday afternoons at Charlie's are something like church for me in the Arizona springtime. Cold beer, good friends, warm sun and boys playing volleyball in the back court (although it troubles me to see so many of them playing barefoot in what amounts to an oversized ashtray. PLEASE keep your shoes on, boys! It reminds me of playing volleyball in an enormous cat litter box.)Charlie's is NOT for the gays who like to put on their tightest T-shirt, gel their hair up and pretend like they just saw someone they know so they can do anything but make eye contact with another human being. It IS for the gays that are comfortable with themselves and enjoy talking to other gays that sometimes are cowboys, sometimes are drag queens, but are almost ALWAYS friendly (even if they're a bit tanked). The small pitchers on Sundays have kind of become a tradition. And it's fun to watch people two-step on the weekend nights. Downsides? Sometimes the crowd looks like the crowd at the rescue mission. The Arizona anti-smoking law somehow doesn't apply to the COVERED patio in the back, therefore making it uncomfortable to breathe back there. And, PLEASE take a cab if you've had too much to drink. Cops hang out waiting to nab ya later on at night. Overall, it's a fun, if somewhat tired, staple of the gay nightlife in Phoenix. Also have "branches"  in Chicago, Denver and Las Vegas.And, it's always a sure-fire hit with straight sisters, brothers, kids and moms (yes, I said moms) that are in from out of town. Especially if they two-step.~~#~0
I really just come to the fair if there is a concert I want to see. It is fun to walk around and see all the sights. I did like that if you got in before 6pm it was half price. More money to spend on goodies. The piggly wiggly currly cheese fries are good. Loved the kettle corn and fry bread. But you can't beat the really cheap concerts and usually every year there is one person that you are like eh 20 bucks is worth it to see them!~~#~0
Can someone please tell me why people go here???Went to breakfast with Deb L, and she had a Living Social deal or one of those deal thingies. The place was packed, probably because it's a holiday week.That doesn't excuse the EXTREMELY poor service. We sat down and waited. And waited. Servers walked by every few moments, nobody stopped to fill our water glasses or take our order. Finally, we both said something to a girl who walked by. She seems mystified that there was a job to do. With that many people working, getting a cup of coffee shouldn't take 15 minutes. Yes. 15 freaking minutes.Food? Mediocre at best. I got the traditional eggs benedict with home fries. The only saving grace with the amount of ham on it. The English muffin didn't seem to be toasted. The eggs were *ok* but nothing great. The home fries? My 9-year old niece could do a better job. My burps right now aren't even good enough to brag about.I'm sure if the service had been better, I wouldn't be so miserable right now. My food coma isn't satisfying. I will *never* go here again. Ever. I felt stupid leaving a tip, it was THAT bad. Total. Fail. Blech.~~#~1
Holy crap is this place good.  With the gazillion milkshake flavors to choose from, I had vanilla....... kinda anti-climatic I know. Next time though.  The burgers were huge with 20 some odd topings to choose from. I had onions and pickles...... I know, another let down. Next time I sware.  Also the onion rings are tops here. Fries looked good too.The decore is a nice 50's diner type with very friendly staff.  Outdoor seating is nice when it's not hot out and it's very close to the theatre which makes it the perfect stop before seeing Mama Mia........ J/K on that one. Saw Batman.~~#~1
I love this place. Food is ALWAYS fresh, cook correct and service is great. Not to mention their lunch specials!!! My husband and I always spend less than 20 bucks and get full and satisfied EVERYTIME!!!!~~#~1
The Jury is still out on this cleaners. Took in 6 pieces, I expected to pick up six pieces the next day. They did a nice job of 5 out of the six garments, ranging from mens slacks to sports coats to dresses; but destroyed one dress. Shouldn't have run it through the dryer - who knew - I expected Catalina to know. Still don't have the problem resolved. So - this is a mixed review. Very happy on 5/6ths of the job - never have had a sports coat done for $2.50 before - but still looking for closure on the last item. Who knows - they may delight me.~~#~0
I've eaten here twice, and both times enjoyed myself immensely.  First, note that this is the smaller location; the one in Mesa has more tables and space. This one is closer to me, so this is the one I go to, but if you are looking to have a large group, you may wish to go to the Mesa location.   That said, I really like this one. The mood is very raw, because of the small size, even at a table you can see the cooks behind the bar, hear the clatter and clang of the kitchen. That said, you can still have conversations here without issue; you just have a bit of background noise.   The food, though...the food is spectacular. Seriously, look at that menu, look at those pictures. The first time I was there I had the chicken tikka masala pasty. Not as good chicken tikka as a straight up Indian restaurant, of course, but still phenomenal, and the pasty just made it that much better. I also snagged the bananoffee pie. It could easily provide dessert for two people; I ate the whole thing. It was just that good. Not too sweet, very banana-y...   Eat here. It's really that simple.    Also, as a tip, there's a parking lot 'round the back that is usually not full, unlike the one on the front. And, though the address is off of University Drive, the front is really facing Hardy. Threw me a bit the first time I was looking for it.~~#~1
Great Italian food with portions designed to share.And it was a good thing our waiter brought that to our attention (he must have heard our comments on the prices).  We ordered 2 half portions and one full (lobster ravioli, a brick of lasagna, and something else I couldn't pronounce) and it was just enough for the 4 of us.  After the alcohol we even kept the bill under $100.  I would definately recommend this place, just be sure to bring a few friends and an appetite!~~#~1
Sometimes things happen, and when they do this is the place where you want them taken care of. The orthopedics department and trauma department have some of the best, and nicest Doctors you'll find in the state.~~#~1
i absolutely LOVE maxim and i have eaten there approximately 2 times a week since i learned about the restaurant a year ago.  the atmosphere is pretty awful, but the food is amazing.  i get a #86, which is a noodle, tofu, and vegetable soup (the broth is meat based).  it is comforting and cheap and always improves a bad day.  everyone i have taken there has enjoyed the food as well (though they tend to enjoy the vietnamese dishes more than the chinese ones). highly, highly recommended.~~#~1
Pet smart did a better job at grooming my dog than my last mobile groomers. They cut and wash my dogs hair just how i like them. Service was nice the young ladies were always helpful since two dogs on a leash can be difficult. I shall return to get my dogs groomed here.  Would recommend.~~#~1
If you are looking for a great location for bulk specialty flours and grains, beans, Freeze Dried fruits, vegetables, meats and dairy...they have a wonderful selection. They also have water storage and emergency supplies like solar ovens. I'm a big fan!~~#~1
I was looking for a place close to where I live for eyebrow waxing and I was referred by About Face Salon here.  (According to AZSpaGirls, About Face are the eyebrow experts but they no longer offer the service....)  They were great about squeezing me in the day I called.  Angela was fantastic, she worked very quickly and with a very light hand.  She is so good with the wax that she doesn't need to tweeze at all, which for me is always the worst part.  (Granted I don't have very um, complicated, eyebrows).  She was very sweet and for $15 I will be returning to her.~~#~1
Now open on Saturdays!!!! Yes!!!!!~~#~1
Decent sports bar.  Don't get me wrong, they have tons of beer choices, decent to good service, and plenty of pub fare...  Few things that bugged me last time..No waitress for about 5 minutes after I sat downSouthwest egg rolls, while good, were tiny compared to other placesToo many tv's had the volume on..  the football game was impossible to hear..I'll be back though..~~#~0
I've been using mineral makeup for a couple years now and Bare Escentuals is the best in my experience. You can order their stuff online as well and it's free shipping after a certain amount, but I like being able to ask questions and compare things side by side before I buy, and the salesgirls are always really helpful with that. Once I find a product I'm loyal to, then I do the online thing. This stuff just feels much better on your skin and doesn't clog your pores. It seems like an initially pricey investment when you're first getting started, but mineral make-up keeps much better and I can use less of it to achieve the effects I want.~~#~1
When I say a certain food contains ingredients such as blue cheese and bacon, what comes to mind?No, I'm not talking about a salad, I'm talking about an ice cream sundae!Sweet Republic is an awesome little ice cream parlor located in a strip mall in Scottsdale, Arizona. This amazing place makes all their ice creams and sorbets in house. Sweet Republic makes some pretty creative flavors. These are just a few examples of what we sampled:Basil Lime SorbetSalted Butter CaramelApple PieDessert HoneyMaple PecanAlmond ButtercrunchCashew TurtleAll of these flavors were wonderful but there was one more that really got me all hot and bothered, and that was their Honey Blue Cheese. That's right, Blue Cheese ice cream. When I first saw it, I did not know what to think but after my first lick I was hooked. It tasted just like a sweet vanilla / honey ice cream with blue cheese crumbles mixed into it. I know it sounds weird but this ice cream is phenomenal. It was sweet, tangy and somewhat salty, all at the same time. Instead of just enjoying this ice cream alone I decided to make my own blue cheese sundae. They have many toppings to choose from, including bacon brittle. When all was said and done my creation contained two scoops of their Honey Blue Cheese ice cream topped with a salted caramel sauce, bacon brittle and a homemade marshmallow that was toasted with a blow torch. This sundae was exploding with flavor. Every bite was crunchy, salty, sweet, tangy and delicious. My fiancé had a waffle cone sundae that contained Salted Butter Caramel ice cream, Almond Buttercrunch ice cream, salted caramel sauce, brownie bites and a homemade marshmallow. Hers was also amazing.The service and prices here were both great. The girl working the night we visited allowed us to sample as many flavors as we wanted and was really friendly and patient with us. The prices here are similar to  Coldstone's. I'm absolutely in love with Sweet Republic and would seriously make a special trip to Scottsdale just to have their ice cream. I shouldn't be telling you all this, for fear that you all would think I'm a pig but I liked their Honey Blue Cheese ice cream so much that after I finished my sundae I ordered a Honey Blue Cheese milkshake to go. It was so yummy!~~#~1
This airport is the most confusing airport I've ever been to.  Obviously it was meant to be small and was originally probably very efficient, but since they have added terminals it makes no sense and you will see the sign you need as you are passing it, instead of having a sign a mile or so ahead telling you were to go.~~#~0
Soggy flavorless pizza served on unwarmed ceramic plate. Carbonara was watery and made with cream instead of eggs. Gnocchi was tough as opposed to light and airy.~~#~1
Special. Not on menu. Chicken strawberry raspberry blackberry blueberry goat cheese salad with raspberry vinagerette. This was THE best salad I've ever had, and probably top 5 best meals in my life.~~#~1
Good food at a good price.~~#~1
Beautiful church. My husband and I were registered members and regularly attended mass here. Fr. John Auther gives excellent homilies. The Marian gift shop has beautiful religious gifts. We got married at this church, but unfortunately had a bad experience. Communication with church staff was poor and we got little support during the stressful planning time. We have since moved to Gilbert, so now we are attending St. Anne's.~~#~0
I didn't go back again.  The haircut turned out to be worse than I thought, being quite unmanageable.  I ended up going back to the local Mexican barber, who charged 12 bucks for a pretty decent haircut.I think they gave better massages than they did haircuts.  Still, it wasn't a bad place, and one could do worse.~~#~0
I went with my sister 2 days ago. It was my first time eating Famous Dave's. I got a hamburger and got some mac & cheese. They were both okay, I tasted better. Now the hot wings & onion rings were better. the place was packed we sat outside.~~#~1
Water park is OK.  However, the parking lot has ZERO security.  No security patrols, no cameras.  My catalytic converters were stolen off my truck in the parking lot at Big Surf Tempe today.  Sawed right off in broad daylight.  According to the cops, car break ins and catalytic converter thefts happen frequently here.  BEWARE!  The water park management doesn't give a shit.  Even the cop laughs because they always say the same thing:  "Our camera is broken but it's getting fixed next week".  What a joke.  If you go, have someone drop you off.  You've been warned!~~#~1
So, I have to admit that I once threw up in the Pita Jungle bathroom, but it was not Pita Jungle's fault - it was definitely something I ate the night before.  It certainly made for a memorable first date experience with my now husband, and we have been back many many times.Oh, how I love Pita Jungle.  I haven't tried anything that I wouldn't have again in a heartbeat - currently I am hooked on the Potato Pizza.  yummy!Their breakfast options are wonderful - definitely try it on a lazy Sunday morning.  There is usually no wait.The ambiance is fantastic, casual and arty, with a little bit of crunchy granola thrown in.A++ for vegetarians and meat-eaters alike.  Eat hummus and pita.  Try falafel.  Try anything on the menu, because it is all good.~~#~1
I absolutely love their personal hotpot room! I tried it for the first time Sunday...and went back Monday again!Their item portion is big and fresh! Only downside is that there isn't any sauce that is pre-made...Other than that, this place is AMAZING~~#~1
You've seen the storyline play out many times - great athlete in his prime signs a multi-year mega-contract, but eventually his body betrays him and he's parked on the bench, getting paid more than the starters.Valle Luna, I'm looking at you.My family used to frequent this place - you could get a nice meal for $8 or $9 per person, and their food was fantastic.But Valle Luna has lost a step.  You see it here and there - the chimi sauce isn't quite the same, the beans are inconsistent, and the fundido just isn't as fun.  And to make matters worse, Valle Luna now demands superstar prices, asking for around $20 for a chimichanga dinner.  I hate to break this to you, guys, but I can get that - and done better - for much cheaper.  And don't even get me started on the rise of Rito's, Chipotle, and Juan's, all of which provide superior food for less than half the price.Their prices have become ridiculous - and I think Valle Luna knows it, because this is one of the only restaurants I can think of that creates a version of their menu WITH NO PRICES for their website.  I'm serious: http://www.valleluna.com/VL_Menu3.html  It looks exactly like the regular menu, just without any idea of how crazy expensive their food has become.  I suppose they figure that you can't (or won't) leave after you've sat down, ordered drinks, and eaten some chips?But much like that past-his-prime athlete, Valle Luna still has one move that reminds you of those glory days, like Jordan's fade-away jumper.  It was his best shot late in his career because it was the only shot he could cleanly get off.   Valle Luna's fried ice cream is so delicious, and since it's dessert, they can't charge $18 for it.   I wish I could tell you the exact price but that's censored on the online menu, too.   So go for dessert sometime soon and reminisce about the glory days, because I suspect it won't be long before the game passes Valle Luna by and they're forced to hang up the aprons.~~#~0
I've gone back a few times since my last review. Every single experience has been fantastic! The burgers are pretty good, BUT do yourself a favor and get the pork tenderloin OMFG!!! Sooooo freaken amazing! Also their onion rings are pretty much perfect! And the fried cheese curd...just get it! I was a little creeped out eating something called cheese curd, but holy deliciousness!~~#~1
We went on a Saturday night and the place was completely dead. There was only one other couple in the entire restaurant section. Very nice decor, but the food was mediocre at best. The only reason this place gets 3 stars is because the service was outstanding.~~#~0
Absolutely awful... these guys have NO idea what they are doing!~~#~1
It is my favorite vietnamese restaurant.It's small but clean. Their soups are great. They serve fresh and tasty foods.Portion is not big enough for me though.I wish they serve bigger size meals.~~#~0
Great pecan apple pancakes!  Superb decaf coffee.  Servers and counter staff are bright and smiling.  Restaurant was clean.  I have already recommended it to another foodie.IF you park in the public lot, just west of the restaurant on 3rd street and eat within 60 minutes, it is free of charge to park.~~#~1
I LOVE LOVE me some Joe's real bbq!!  They have the best ribs in town and their bake beans are amazing!  There's little pieces of meat mixed in with the beans and it's sooo good.  Their mac and cheese is great as well as their corn.  Pretty much everything is great here.  The first time I went here was when I first moved out to AZ back in 2006.  My fiance took me here because he knows I'm a bbq fanatic, and I swear I though to myself, "What is this place?  A cafeteria?".  I did not expect the food to be any good at all.  Well, was I took quick to judge!  Taught me never to judge a book by it's covers again!  Even though you get in line, pick up a tray and order your food like you would to the lunch lady in HS, the food is the best.  They even have an outdoor seating area with trees and lights.  It makes you feel like you're at a nice park having a nice bbq.Joe's is hands down my favorite bbq joint in the valley.  Nothing tops this.  Anything you order is amazing.Oh, and try their chocolate chip cookie.  Soft and melty and so so good!~~#~1
Do not go to this car wash. I dropped my kids off at choir and thought I'd run in for a quick car wash. Oh no! They locked my keys in the car. I couldn't get On-Star to unlock my Suburban because it was under a huge canopy and couldn't get a signal. Instead of calling a locksmith, the car washers tried and tried to get in through the window. Thankfully my husband was able to leave work early, go retrieve the kids from choir practice, and then come rescue me at the car wash with a spare set of keys. I was trapped there over an hour!  The manager then had the audacity to get mad at me because I was upset at their incompetence. They didn't even comp the car wash!  If you go here, don't pay for your car wash until your car is done!~~#~1
What an awesome sushi place! I highly recommend How do You roll, if you want some sushi done quickly and freshly and without wait. what a novel idea. I want to thank the manager Amanda for taking good care of me, can't wait to come back again!~~#~1
Love the atmosphere, the patios, drinks and especially the chicken lollipops.  If you haven't tried them, they are buffalo wings with a handy bone to hold on to while you eat.  The sauce with blue cheese dressy is one for the record books!I am also a fan that they serve breakfast 7 days a week and have free wifi.  This is a great place to meet for work or meet after a game.  Not too stuffy, but nice enough that it isn't just labeled a bar.~~#~1
i called them and they wanted to charge $30 for fingerprints!!!!!  What a joke.  I found a place on the other side of the air park who did it for $10.  Caveat Emptor!  If if could give them a zero rating, I would have.On the other side of the airpark off of Greenway-Hayden loop is Global Pi Security.  $10 for prints. Their address is 7807 East Greenway road, suite 9, Scottsdale, Az.  globalpi-security (dot) com.  Good luck.~~#~1
So, my husband and I went to to Bombero's for happy hour. Neither of us consider ourselves wine afficianados, but we know what we like. I told the server, Tim, that I wanted a heavy red, and he delivered. It was a wonderful malbec that had deep fruity flavor and a nice hint of vanilla. It went very well with the chocolate dessert that my husband and I shared. In the reviews, I see that many people complain about the bread and the bruscetta. I have to say that it was wonderful to have a bread with bruschetta  that did not destroy my gums after eating it. The bread was flavorful, soft and didn't feel like it just came out of a toaster oven. The toppings were very tasty, especially the Tapenade,  the Chimmichurri and the Brie with fig. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the ambiance, the food and not having to valet the car on Central Avenue.~~#~1
Average sushi but lots of fun.  I love just taking things off the conveyer belt.  Alcohol is also a bit pricey.~~#~0
Just called at 9:45 to ask when they were open until. Woman said they were already closed but website says open until 10 pm. Really?? Obviously don't care about patronage...mexican is a dime a dozen in the new NEW Mexico...no thanks. Next!~~#~1
I've been a fan of La Bocca for a long time because it served the needs of an underserved demographic on Mill Avenue. Canteen offers many things that La Bocca does...and more. What is that demographic exactly? ...Late twenties, looking for something chic and classy without paying a ridiculous premium for those qualities. Mill has plenty to offer for the ASU kids and the older adults, but for those of us who lie somewhere in between, places like La Bocca and Canteen are just right. Canteen one ups La Bocca, in fact, because there are menu items included in happy hour (50% off most drinks and select food items). Here are the highlights:The margarita. It's a real margarita! (It's not a lime daiquiri masquerading as margarita. Loads of sour mix does not a margarita make.)The chips and salsa. Both fresh and delicious. The pico de gallo is particularly fresh and delicious. The ribs. Sweet and spicy...the level of heat from the habenero is perfect and the meat literally falls right off the bones.The ambiance. It's chic but not pretentious. My friends and I really enjoyed the Latin music. Our suggestion would be to emphasize that music and minimize the clubby stuff (it verges on Scottsdale).To contextualize some of the other yelper's comments. I was glad to hear that one yelper didn't find Canteen suited to his beer and Jaeger shot needs. There's a bar (or ten) down the street for that. For the yelpers that found the portions to be too small, I suspect they didn't understand the Mexican take on tapas that the taco menu is going for (in fact, the whole valley suffers from a lack of tapas locations). Finally, the service complains...my service has been cordial and attentive, even when super-busy. Folks, this place is new, let's let it go through it's growing pains before issuing such harsh judgments that might jeopardize the success of a really wonderful place.~~#~1
Beer is awesome (first timers must do the beer flight sampler) and I have never had a meal that wasn't excellent!   A quick note, there isn't a/c in the building so keep that in mind during the summer months - although that doesn't stop anyone from going, the place is always jumping!~~#~1
Was in the area for a grad school interview and the BF was craving some red meat. Came here based on yelp reviews, left pretty full, content about the food. Service was friendly enough, but we had some trouble communicating what we wanted. We settled on the kalbi, bulgogi and the ribeye? steak meats, with an order of the tofu soup. Everything was a-okay but I think the only thing that stood out was the ribeye. Normally we like to cook the meat ourselves but since we didnt want to stink on our plane ride back to cali, we decided to let them do it for us. Side dishes were standard with the different pickled veggies, kimchi, potato salad, etc. Waiters were pretty prompt in bringing out replacement side dishes for us.   Since we don't know the area very well, the stars are good service, being open at odd hours (I think we got there at 4pm?) clean restaurant, decent food. -2 stars for small portions and no real wow factor.~~#~0
Loooove this place! Yes it's pricey, but good sushi usually is. The guys making the rolls were friendly. The atmosphere is nice. Hubby absolutely loved the quail eggs and I couldn't get enough of the spicy shrimp roll. Seriously, try it. You won't be disappointed!~~#~1
No rake, no annual membership or fees.  Just a fun "home" game in a strip mall minutes from my parents' house.  They have 1-2 and 2-3 NL games and the min buy is $40, max is $500. Everyone is friendly and they offered us snacks and drinks while we played.  Since there isn't a rake or fee, don't be cheap (like one guy there) and tip the dealer generously.~~#~1
Talk about an amazing experience...First off the office is well decorated and clean...the staff pleasant and helpful...Rene the hygenist is caring and gentle.  Dr. Keith is really personable and excellent at what he does.  They don't do extra work that doesn't need to be done, they are very honest.  The office takes many kinds of insurance and they are great with kids too!~~#~1
This has got to be the best barber shop I've ever been to in my 38 years on this planet.  I was always getting terrible haircuts at places like Great Clips and Hair Cuttery (when I lived in Virginia Beach), and I just assumed it was because I naturally had jacked-up hair.  After getting my first haircut from Israel (the barber, not the country), I know I'd have a hard time looking elsewhere.  I don't know if these dudes were ever in the military, but their attention to detail is top notch.~~#~1
There are so many good things for me to say about this place that I have no idea where to begin.The ambiance is so amazing no matter what time of day you go. The small, intimate bar area (with quite a few pretty men!) is lovely on a sunny day out, while the tables inside are the perfect place for a romantic date. The menu is so great, carrying lots of new age food items (quinoa, black forbidden rice bowl, kale,and lots of dishes carrying local food items). It does make me very sad that they do not have a lot of vegetarian/vegan menu items. One time I tried to order the wood-fired vegetables and the waiter *swore* it was vegan. As soon as I tasted it I knew it had butter on it, and the waiter subsequently learned he had no idea what "vegan" meant. We ended up having to call a manager over.The cocktail menu is so interesting it's hard to decide what to get. My favorite is the Dark and Stormy, which has ginger beer. *the BEST* cocktail around IMO. Do not pass up dessert. The bananas foster is amazing! Not traditional but good in and of its own.~~#~1
We had a great time. Had bottle service with Katie. who was super friendly. Our drinks were never empty, and that was nice because we were celebrating a birthday. The music and atmosphere were great.~~#~1
So yummy!  I got the low calorie yogurt with all kinds of yummy fruit in it & didn't even feel guilty.  Such a fun place to go with friends or as a nice dessert after dinner. I can't wait to go again!~~#~1
Asi-Asi ,Menza-Menza,Comme ci Comme ca...you get the jist .So -so ..(a solid so-so ).He liked the taco's ,i liked the steak salad ( it had a nice little kick to it) Service was good.The atmosphere just wasn't my cup of tea ,that said ,i can see why some people like it here .Drinks were solid,menu was decent .Good place to get hammered ,I suppose.I had a Pinneapple mind eraser that was ......~~#~0
I've been meaning to try this place for months and I'm so glad that the temperature has finally dropped to less than 100 degrees so I could take advantage of the outdoor patio for lunch! The service was kind of slow..not sure if it was on purpose so I won't knock any stars off for that cause the food was delicious! Got the chicken, goat cheese, bacon, apple, pesto foccacia and would def recommend it. Everything tasted really fresh! A perfect lunch spot :)~~#~1
I am leaving this store angry and can't resist writing a review! The staff is incredibly useless....if you can actually find someone to help you. The store is huge with very little signs to guide you. Therefore I always wander aimlessly looking for the one simple thing I stopped in for (even though I tell myself I will never go back) with no one to help me. Today they were out of an item I bought last week and need more of to finish my project. I asked the only 100 year old lady I could find to check the back and she told me they have nothing in back and to ask customer service. The lady at customer service was actually a reasonable age and when I asked her to call the Indian Bend store she handed me their number and said "well you can call them". I stormed out soooo mad and this time I promise to never go back. Hobby Lobby or Michaels is worth the drive!!!~~#~1
My sister was leaving back to Texas and I decided to find a BBQ place that may have a similar taste and feel. I found this place through a Mesa newspaper ad.Anywho, as we pulled in I was like I hope this place is good. We parked in the back and walked along the side where you can order your food to go. As we waited we decided to head inside and as we walked through the dining area to the line, I was already eyeballing other peoples plates. I could see the ribs and at that point I couldn't decided on a plate, but went ahead with the plate that had everything.I ordered Ribs, Pork, and chicken and as I was ordering I seen some sausage come out of their bbq oven. So I didn't even hesitate because every since I've moved here from Texas, I have yet to find a place to have the yummy peppery tasting sausage we have back home. I asked for a piece of it for tasting and was granted a taste. Needless, to say I ordered a quarter lb with everything else I ordered.The chicken was without a doubt great smoked bbq chicken I have always wanted. Great flavor with not an overbearing smoke flavor. Also the ribs were tender and packed with flavor and smoke taste. The smoked pork was smoke tasty but a little on the sweeter side, but that was nothing the Habenero BBQ couldn't accommodate. Which is offered on the side. Oh and the bread tasted like some homemade goodness bread. As if it was fresh out of the oven with a little garlic butter. Superb! The Mac and cheese was super duper great.In Texas, we have bbq joints in every corner. I have tried it all and I will have to say this is one place I would have on my top list if we had it there.BIG bbq sauce thumbs up for this joint!!~~#~1
Saw a show here last night. Stage is raised to a proper height, acoustics are pretty decent and the sound system is adequate for live acts. Three trapezoidal speakers flown above the stage provide good coverage and nice clarity. There's a couple of subs tucked beneath the stage. They have some moving lights(mirrors move not heads), and some LED par cans. Monitors are on the stage floor, and are JBLs so they seem decent. If it were up to me, I'd toss about 12 more cans on the front wash and add some side wash. They have the trussing to do it .Staff is attractive, and friendly. Knowledgeable about the area and eateries too. There's a patio where you can smoke outside, and they have heaters so you don't freeze your *** off. Drinks are reasonably priced for Scottsdale - and they had some good specials last night which ranged from beer to cinnamon whiskey to vodka - so your bases should be covered.I'd go back. Go early, or good luck parking. Also - note that last night was Christmas week, so even though it was Wednesday tons of cops were out and about, pulling over all kinds of people as they left Old Town Scottsdale. So word to the wise - Don't Drink and Drive.~~#~0
It is what it is. No frills. Fine front desk staff and general cleanliness. I felt safe and the bed was comfortable. I'll tell ya - my favorite thing about this place is the bar Baer's Den at the end of the parking lot! The breakfast should not be $10, it should be included! I did however have a fantastic breakfast sandwich at the Safeway right down the street!~~#~0
This is a fun place.  It is a great place for a fast, cheap meal.  Is it truly authentic?  It is probably closer to being authentic to many places around the country. Wagamama-like?  Perhaps.  If you know how to order you will do okay here.  A great addition to restaurants in Tempe!~~#~0
Always good food and good service. Best gyros around. I know I always get speedy service so I can eat my food and not be there for hours.~~#~1
Excellent food! Agree the sizzling rice soup is a must try. I had chicken pad thai 5 of 7 spicy level because I like spicy food. Great you can request spiciness level on each entree.~~#~1
I have been here 3 times, and find it unique to Phoenix with a country French ambience without being "cute-sy." The patio is one of the loveliest we have here in Scottsdale. My daughter and I celebrated an early Mother's Day here recently. We were seated in just the right spot on the patio to tuck my grandson and his stroller in a corner next to the table. We splurged on some white sangria for lunch.....so pretty it had it's photo posted on Facebook. The Brie and Carmelized apples also came with grapes and strawberries and it was a very large serving of cheese. It could easily be a meal or feed 4 as an appetizer. We actually ran out of bread, because the Brie wheel was a nice large serving. The smoked ham sandwiches on crusty baguette are so good that I am craving them a few days later ....we used the still-warm gooey Brie on them, too. This place is just special! Plan an event, take a guest. It is a spot that will make it memorable. This was my first lunch as a new Grandmother with my daughter. My daughter is from the beach area in SCal, and she was wow'd. Thanks for the memories.......beautiful day.~~#~1
Just got back from lunch here, and I must say it was delicious! We sat outside on the patio which was very nice on such a pretty sunny day. I had the beef gyro which was huge and so so yummy! It came with a fresh greek salad and a yogurt sauce and I couldn't have asked for anything more.Definitely recommend coming here!~~#~1
We went here for my wife's birthday, and it's a rare 5-star review for me. They scored on food, presentation, service and atmosphere. We sat indoors - it's a bit hot out still - and loved the decor, including the fun pillows on our large booth seat. Service was prompt, friendly, and attentive - but we never felt rushed. They make a killer mango mojito that perfectly balances the mango, lime and rum flavors. The kurobuta pork was perfectly prepared. And after having some disappointing lobster (in Maine of all places) the Maine lobster here was done just right - firm but not tough. They serve it "lazy style" and did a great job with both claw and tail meat coming out perfectly. A special birthday souffle topped the evening off. Expensive but absolutely worth it for a special occasion.~~#~1
I agree with the other reviewers.. Ink bomb is definitely a shop that has a family vibe. All the tattooers are down to earth and have you, their customer in mind. There are usually 3 or 4 tattooers there, giving you a wide variety on technique, style, and experience.. all of which are important when picking your tattooer. I suggest always going in and having a consultation and looking at each persons portfolio to choose someone who fits your style whether it be "New school" or "Traditional"   This shop has on open layout and a friendly vibe which allows your to let your guard down a bit.. because we all know tattoo shops can be intimidating....I will definitely be recommending this to all my friends and family.~~#~1
New N. Scottsdale location, Baaaaaaad!  The were 10 staff members milling around and there was no manager on sight.  $10.00 for a mediocre burger, with an uncooked, tasteless bun not large enough to encompass all the arugula.  They forgot the sauce, which apparently is the main ingredient.  The upgrades are ridiculous.  $1.00 here for cheese on an already "well priced" burger (btw Flemings blue cheese/bacon burger $6, best in town), $5,00 here for fries.  C'mon.  And, it's the same two hispanic guys, who don't have any idea about chef inspired food, cooking in the kitchen as every other restaurant, there is no chef For the price, you want to see the chef/owner representing, especially at a new location, and, you want competent staff who treats you as #1, and not their conversing with the other staff members as #1, and you want to enjoy what is supposed to be one of the best burgers in town!  What a disappointment.  The lack of top down management care and supervision carries through in all elements of the poor experience.  Take a pass.~~#~1
My go-to restaurant for very tasty, genuine Thai food. Great lunch specials.  Favorites from the dinner menu: fish cake, tom kha soup, pad thai, hot basil, Thai iced tea~~#~1
HELLLLLLLLO GOLFERS!   What a sexy course this is.   This ranks up there with some of the best courses I've ever played, and THE BEST desert course I have ever played!    Yes it's desert links style golf, but you're in the desert so what do you expect?  It's kind of a trek, but it'll be worth it.   From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave you'll enjoy the service and scenery.  A real private club feel.As mentioned earlier this is DESERT LINKS GOLF!   No adjoining fairways, and all the crap plays as PGA desert (lateral).   The fairways are pretty wide for the most part, so you can spray the ball a bit, but there is definitely some carry involved on some of the tee boxes.  Hole 18 is a very hard core par 4.   Long carry on the approach to the green with a TON of water along the right side of the fairway and green.   This is the kind of hole that can ruin a good day on the course real quick.   Don't be afraid to lay up.  :)    Oh, and there are mens ratings for ALL the tee boxes, I'd recommend higher handicappers play from the forward tees, because this course could be really hard if you're a mediocre golfer... Maintenance was perfect, even in September after baking in the Arizona heat all summer.   The fairways were well manicured, and not too hard.  Nice rough, but not too tall.   A slightly errant shot will be caught, but you won't have to worry about searching for your ball for 5 minutes either.   The greens were also perfect.   Nice and fast, and TRUE!Ok, I'm done gushing about this course...   Give it a shot, you won't regret it.~~#~1
very laid back, very clean. This was my first piercing since I was a little kid. I had my tongue piercing it was very professional and they answered all of my questions. I went to this place specifically because of the good ratings they had online. My friend also had a tragus piercing here that went seamlessly also. I felt very safe and comfortable.~~#~1
We tried this last night for our date night.  We were impressed.  The waitress was amazing in explaining the menu and making suggestions. This is a great place to relax and talk.  The food was great.  I had the Tartiflette...WOW it was so good.  My husband had the La Potence, which is their speciality.  He thought it was great...We will be back...~~#~1
Wanted some mexican that wasn't taco bell. The hotel recommend this place. The restaurant smelled like the inside of a tomato sauce can. I was turned off almost immediately. I decided to sit on the patio and try it out anyway.I ordered the Chipotle BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad with a light cilantro lime dressing. It was okay. The chips and salsa were okay too, nothing to brag about. The salsa tasted like it came from a can. I'm happy I ordered a salad. The redeeming factors were the Arizona Sunset Margarita and the good service. I think once restaurants turn into chains, they seem to lose their original character.~~#~0
The food isn't all that. I order an Ahi Salad, which was barely touched. On the other hand, the chicken Popsicle my friends ordered were quite delightful. all in all, that atmosphere was surely enjoyable.~~#~0
Best breakfast in the valley. Dinner sucks. Well, let's clarify a bit here. We've ordered blueberry pancakes, stuffed french toast, muffins, and a few other b-fast items. They were all stupidly good. For dinner, we've tried a couple dishes such as the recommended jumbalaya - SUCKS! Stay away from that canned garbage. Back to breakfast...dang, that's incredible!~~#~1
I heart Sky Harbor Airport Parking...Of course, it's always nice to find a ride to or from the airport but when you're all out of favors and you have only yourself to rely on, it comes down to driving yourself or getting a taxi.  Sky Harbor Parking to the rescue.  For $8 a day or cheaper if you print the coupons from their website, the folks at Sky Harbor Parking make it easy to drop your car and get to your gate in no time... and I've used them a handful of times solo and with the BF so I know it's door-to-door consistent service.  If you are interested in covered parking, call ahead, but otherwise, just drive over to Washington and 40th and they will take care of you from there.  Also, I recommend calling from the airport once you have your bags and they are always good about picking you up within minutes to take you back to your car.I hope you'll find Sky Harbor Airport Parking as useful and convenient as I do... safe travels!~~#~1
I LOVE Kona's happy hour. Amazing deals on great sushi rolls, and the diner can always count on fast and friendly service. I am always happy with my experience at Kona, and find myself comparing it to other sushi restaurants. None can compare to Kona. Kona is the only place that offers my cherished Skinny Cucumber Mojito, and I come here often for it. I ask for this drink at other places and am always shocked that most don't even offer a skinny option, let alone the cucumber mojito. I have dined in the Scottsdale location as well as the Cherry Creek location in Denver, and both have equivalent high marks in service and food quality.~~#~1
Wanna try it? Now is your chance! One more day of this LivingSocial deal: 12 days for $49http://t.livingsocial.com/deals/453990?ref=email-jp&rpi=85154658~~#~1
If you want a dog and are in the area, this is a pretty good call. Having said that, it is probably not worth a special trip. You can find a better hot dog or brat at a ballpark or in the supermarket.~~#~0
Love love love this place.  Great appetizers and cocktail menu.  Must visit in Old Town Scottsadale~~#~1
I love this place. I just tried the other Ethiopian restaurant in the Valley, and was disappointed, and my gratitude for Cafe Lalibela multiplied. The food here is fresh and authentic, and the staff are really nice. I'm so lucky to live down the street! Tons of vegan options, too.~~#~1
I wrote a less than stellar review about this place some time ago and decided that my prior awful experience might have been a fluke and as I love great BBQ, decided to give them another go .....  I was right the first time!As before, the food was ho-hum at best, the prices too high vs the product quality but the death blow to me was once again, their customer service or shall I say lack of customer service?We had to ask the bartender if we could get a drink (That's odd) and all the wait staff acted like they were doing us a favor by waiting on us.To top it all off, they had little to no air conditioning so it was brutal to sit through a combination of bad food, crummy service and high heat!!!For me, this place is officially off the books and we sure won't be back. Lesson # 1: "Your in the service industry, try and acy like it"As a BBQ fan, I'll try elsewhere ...............~~#~1
I been to many stadiums and this is one of my favorites. I attended a game against the Atlanta Braves and it was a great experience.Food prices are typical for any MLB stadium but get the combo meals and it seems cheaper. The bigger the beer the cheaper it seems. There really isn't a bad seat inside the entire place. Get there early enough and you can go down tot he bleachers during batting practice to catch a homerun hit. The staff is very friendly and talkative.If I lived in Arizona I would get season tickets. The merchandise pricing is pretty cheap too compared to most stadiums. $23 for a hat compared to $41 at Dodgers Stadium.~~#~1
I enrolled my 2 year old son and 4 year old daughter into Hubbard. They've completed 2 swim lessons each and the results are dramatic. They have made huge strives in their water skills. Plus, it seems to enable them with confidence and self esteem after each lesson.~~#~1
You want to go to Four Peaks. Trust me.~~#~1
If it was possible I would give 3.5 stars.  I rounded down because the first time I ordered from here they screwed up my sandwich (I ordered a cheese hero and they gave me a ham and cheese hero - ham-stink is permanent and since I detest ham, it was a whole sandwich killer).Meatball hero was pretty good though I would not rush back to get another.  When I finally did get a cheese hero, it was delicious - this I would rush back to get.  Husband loves the Bobby.The service is a little slow so I'm going to try ordering through their website the next time.  Capriottis has definitely earned a spot in my sandwich place rotation.~~#~0
We went here once a week for the year my husband was in grad school.   The food is a 4, but the waitresses are a 5.   It was a half mile from our apartment and so we would walk there and walk back to work off the huge portions.    This is the only restaurant in my life where I could consider myself a regular.   We never really talked with the waitresses or knew their names, but they always knew what I wanted; I didn't have to order.  They always gave me water with no ice no lemon, my husband's with ice and lemon, gave me my panang curry with chicken medium and waited for my husband to choose what he wanted. He probably ordered most of the items on the menu.  They refilled my rice if I ran out without asking.  Our bill always came to $19.53 for dinner more times than I can remember.  We went maybe twice for lunch, but almost always for dinner.  My husband graduated last month and we moved from Tempe but we miss this place dearly.~~#~1
Service was great, and always an interesting time on a late Saturday night.~~#~0
The restaurant has 6 tables which make it possible for you to eat-in, but this place is definitely more suited towards take out or delivery.  Just don't expect service if you eat-in.  You order at a counter and if you choose to eat-in, you will get your soup in a take out container, eat on paper plates and styrofoam cups, but get your entrees served on platters.The house special won ton soup was pretty tasty and was loaded with a variety of fresh veggies, as well as chicken, pork, and shrimp pieces.  However, one key ingredient was missing - won tons!General Tso's chicken was fried and served with broccoli and sufficient sauce.  The Mongolian beef was more Mongolian and less beef.Overall the food was OK, except for the disappointment of the missing wontons, and I would probably consider this place again for delivery.~~#~0
Preface: I'm being nice3 stars is an OK rating and I don't want my opinions to skew the rating scale but a 2.5 star option if available would be welcome, again I'm being nice.This place is terrible. (I might be exaggerating)  I have heard horrible stories about the brewery in Tucson, how the beer is fine but the food is absolute crap.  I figured hey they are moving to Scottsdale in an area with an insane amount of delicious dining establishments, they have to of retooled that menu ... they didn't.  The beer honestly is good not great 4peaks IMO is at least 2x better (again being nice) but I respect a local presence and craft beer so I cant knock them for trying and building a successful brand.That being said the food is really nothing special at all, they offer pairings like mac and cheese pizza (too gross to try) to things like salmon and steak (too fancy for here).  I tried a burger, usually safe with a mix of sweet potato and regular fries.  I also had the monkey shine which has the highest alcohol content (something I am supportive of) and even after that beer the food disappointed (how can that be?!).  It wasn't that the burger was horrible but it just wasn't anything special, it was bland and I got the western that had tons of stuff on it.   The biggest problem was the fries which ironically seemed to come out of the frozen food section of a local Frys Food and Drug (not even a signature, Kroger brand - house brand aka the worst).  A friend joining me had the wings, the wings were actually pretty good but they were wings and wings are gonna be good in a place like this especially after some beer so I feel that we should take that for what its worth.With mediocre food at best and OK beer I don't see any reason to go here over 4 peaks.Improve your menu and I'll give you another shot. :)~~#~0
Live very close to this theater so I go there whenever I can. Went to one of the grand opening movies "Avengers". The movie was great but when using the restrooms they are very small for the amount of people going there (5 stalls) there was no toilet paper, one was out of order, long waiting lines and one soap dispenser didn't work . Went to get popcorn and watched one of the wait staff take one cup, pour something into another cup then replace the used cup back with the unused ones. The seats in the theater do make you sore after about a hour. They don't rock back and the seats are starting to bow in from constant use so you feel like you are arching forward.~~#~0
Groupon rip-off. Small salad, three extremely small plates of mediocre pasta desserts that cloyed the palate. All for an advertised value of $90. Will NEVER return.~~#~1
The fish tacos were good and the trendy atmosphere was nice. But, the whole thing was a bit too formula...like "restaurant in a box" concept. No outlyers, not much spice, fairly bland, middle of the road.....but wait, its in Arizona! Ok, no political jokes re Arizona. I was so-so with Blanco and will continue to explore on the next visit.~~#~0
Dr. Kanarish was exactly how I expected he would be by the other reviews I read on Yelp and Google. His staff was very friendly and the facility is extremely clean. I have an 8 year old Boxer that needed a large tumor type growth removed from his paw and was given very high estimates from different hospitals. Phoenix Mountain Animal gave me a very reasonable price on the initial exam and the actual removal, stitches, etc... ended up being much more affordable than any place I had called. I was originally offered care credit( a payment plan) but I ended up not needing it because the bill was within reason. I just picked up my dog and he was a little sleepy from the local anesthetic, so we will see how the next few days go. A great first experience and am planning on transferring all our future visits to see Dr. Karanish. It's great to see there are honest and compassionate Doctors around. I hope anyone looking for an exceptional Dr. will consider Dr. Karanish.~~#~1
I first saw them Saturday morning at the Phoenix Public Market and told myself that I would have to try them soon. I was too full from all the sampling with the different vendors. My coworkers and I went to check out the food trucks that gather on Thursday outside of Whole Foods by Raintree and the 101. I saw that Mojo Bowl was there and made my mind up right away to get their food.I decided to get the Red, White, and Kale salad. I love quinoa and kale so it was the obvious choice for me. I also wanted to try one of their smoothies out. I went with the Coco Coca. The description mentioned that it was like a drinkable Almond Joy and I was sold right there. The total came to $13, not too shabby considering the portions. I didn't even touch my salad because the smoothie was so fulling, definitely a meal in itself. Towards the end of the work day I was getting hungry and decided to try some of the salad. I was asked if I wanted a balsamic or raspberry vinaigrette to go with the salad. I told the guy whatever tastes better and he told me that would be the raspberry vinaigrette. The salad was delicious. The kale was chopped up so finely that it really didn't have a taste so if you're not a huge fan of kale you might still like the salad. The portion was huge, it was good for 2 meals. I try to eat healthy and like to support local businesses. Mojo Bowl definitely brings those two together for me. I can't wait to try more of their smoothies and food out soon!~~#~1
Went here and we had a groupon. The ambiance was awesome. Two stories down, you enter a cozy space. We were a few minutes early for our reservations and we hung out in the bar. Table was ready and I ordered the lobster dinner. It was delicious and they cracked it table side. We definitely will be back again.~~#~1
First off, I am not a Cubs fan.  But I came here to watch them play the A's during spring training and thought this park rocked.  Its cozy enough get within heckling distance of the players, but it has a lot of the amenities of Wrigley Field...including Old Style beer and florescent green hot dog relish.  All this and sunshine too!  What's not to like?~~#~1
we rode our bikes here today in search of a new place to try. the online menu looked like it had a few options for non-meat eaters (although it is very much a meat heavy menu). for an easter sunday lunch, it was very empty, not a good sign. but we had no wait and they easily passed the water glass test. our server was very attentive and checked on us throughout the meal without being overbearing. the decor is "country" but not like cracker barrel....more like neo farm dining. i had the blackened fish sandwich, which was cooked really well, nice and seared but juicy, topped with onion, pickles, tomatoes and butter lettuce. i had the jalpeno and cheese grits on the side and they were rich and creamy with just a slight hint of heat...nothing to burn your mouth. my wife had the tuna sandwich, which was also tasty and seared just right. she did have to navigate a big piece of fascia which is not that delectable, but it was her dish, not mine. her side of gigantic asparagus tasted wonderful. i would love to come back here and hope they are able to make it here. well worth the bike ride.~~#~1
I'd leave my Scottsdale bubble for a few reasons (and yes there are additional exceptions)1. Nobuo at Teeter House.2. Fez.3. My friends in various parts of the valleyand 4. Mekong Supermarket.I consider myself to be a huge fan of Asian cuisine. Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Korean, Indian. You name it, I'll eat it. I have my healthy moments, but I am a seasoned eater and I am not afraid of exploring the world through my palate.Mekong is the perfect place for me to massage my senses. The aroma and sensations from the exotic product. The stunning visual of a catfish being bopped on the head, and then cut up and packaged. The cheesy elevator music on the loudspeaker. The delicious taste of a spring roll from the hot food bar. This place has it all.I usually come here for my Asian condiments and live seafood. Want a live crab? Boom. Done. Want spicy mustard or sriracha in a large bottle for cheap? It's yours.To me, there is nothing like taking the 10 mile drive in traffic to Mekong because I know I am going to get everything I want. Make the trek. You won't regret it.~~#~1
Okay, I will start out by saying that I just picked this place out because it was near a bar we were going to afterward.  Boy Howdy, am I glad I found this little gem!  Upon entering I was overwhelmed with the idea that we were in an Italian friend's grandma's circa 1980's dining room.  It was quaint.  It was old school.  It kinda made me a little nervous!The general feel of the waiter we had was extremely laid back.  Traditional Italian dude who was a little tardy in checking back, etc.  Our water glass was NEVER refilled.  Got a little more nervous.They brought out really good looking bread and poured some herbed olive oil out for me (I declined because I have celiac disease and can't have regular bread.).  My husband said the bread and the olive oil was amazing.  I had called ahead and they said they had many gluten free options.I ordered the Chicken al Berto.  My husband ordered veal and a side of spaghetti with meat sauce.  We started with a Tomato Caprese appetizer.  The tomato was slightly under ripe but the mozza and basil made up for it...and in the center was a bunch of roasted red peppers which totally made the dish!  Nom nom nom.  The balsamic was excellent as well.  I must now do peppers with my Caprese!Then our entrees came out.  My chicken had fontina cheese, pancetta and spinach.  There was a little line of mushrooms in a marsala sauce which I'm not sure if it was supposed to be there or not.  I'm super happy it was!  This is close to if not the BEST chicken dish I've eaten.  The chicken was moist which is usually questionable in Italian restaurants I've found.  The quality of the Fontina cheese was impeccable.  The pancetta was crisp and plentiful.  Then I tasted the mushrooms!!!! OMG!!  Freaking amazing!  I may have to try the Chicken Marsala sometime just to have more mushrooms!  Divine.  It took a while to eat, mainly due to the waiter's "chill" attitude but we shall go back again and again and again.  I don't care if you don't get anything included with your main entree.  The portion of entrees were HUGE.  My husband loved both his veal dish and said the meat sauce was one of the best he's had.  Fresh, fresh, fresh.It's on my new list of first priority restaurants.  And I think the prices were pretty good.  Less than $15 for my chicken, $20 for the veal and $10 for the Caprese.  I'm so there next week!Oh, and put your phone on vibrate.  They kind of insist!  And that's okay too!~~#~1
I'm sad to say that I wasn't in love with MacAlpine's.  The fact that the building has never been restored is cool, in a dirty kind of way.  The floors will never be clean enough, because they are so old.  That may seem ridiculous, but cleanliness is important to me when I'm eating somewhere.Our server was odd, but helpful and attentive.  We spent a good amount of time oogling the random items displayed throughout and were entertained with our surroundings.The food is where I saw the problem- my Mac Cheeseburger was bland and tasteless.  My broccoli and cheese soup was below average.  I wasn't impressed one bit.We ended up having dessert.  I opted for a single scoop of Chocolate Malt Krunch, which I'd never had before and didn't love (total personal preference as my friend loved it).  MacAlpine's is cool, but I think purely as a place to get something sweet.~~#~0
I found Lisa G's while driving through phoenix with a friend. The exterior looked promising and we prepared ourselves for a treat. We were in for a a shock! We ordered the antipasto plate and while there were serious issues with it, it turned out to be the best thing we were served. I ordered the chicken rolatini (the special of the day) and it was just plain bad! The chicken was dry and under seasoned, the Rosemary potatoes were soggy  and the veggie medley  (squash, corn, green beans, etc.) was over cooked and the juices spilled over into the potatoes. It was one of the worst $17 meals that I have ever had! My friend ordered the veggie salad and it was one literal hot mess. Just horrible food! I see that others had the mini burgers and bowl of balls and found them to be tasty. I wish I had ordered those. As it is this is one place I would never revisit or recommend to a friend!~~#~1
I found myself in Phoenix for a week. I prefer Marriott, but a co-worker insisted on Hilton....and then didn't go on the trip. Nice.Anyway, the stay was a hodgepodge of experiences. Downsides: The room was nondescript on the whole, but the neck of the shower was pulled partly out of the wall and the shower curtain was partly torn and had red (?!?) mold on it. I didn't have a car, so the parking lot didn't bother me, but the area on one side of the hotel was sketchy and had a fair amount of undesirable foot traffic. The nearest station to get on the light rail was 3 blocks either way from the hotel.Upsides: The staff was friendly and super-helpful in recommending EXCELLENT restaurants, including hole-in-wall, genuine Mexican joints. The hotel has a shuttle van that will, if you reserve it or can snag a ridealong, take you anywhere within five miles of the hotel for free, and then pick you up again. Naturally you should tip the driver (also a great guy), but it still beats taking a cab. The driver gets bonus points for letting us jump out and grab a coffee on the way to our destination! It also is only 1.5 blocks from Fez, a fantastic restaurant. I was not knocked out by the facility, but the people were great. I'll still probably stay a Marriott user when I return, but I'll sure consider the Garden Inn again.~~#~0
Went here Sunday for the Rockies vs Dodgers game. We got some great free seats just to the left of home plate. Love the awning that provides lots of shade to people who just want to watch the game from the top of the seat section. I heard that the game was sold out, but it looked maybe 75% full. Parking wasn't too bad for us. We actually parked maybe 4 lanes away from the stadium. The food was ok. This place just didn't have the spring training feel l've come to love. This really is too far of a drive for me and I truly love the vibe and energy I get from the crowds at older stadiums like Phoenix Muni and Tempe Diablo and even Hohokam and Scottsdale. This just didn't seem to compare.~~#~0
So Weekends are usually hubbys choice and he decided on Rock Bottom.I don't mind coming here, I really like their Mac and Cheese.You can get it with or without chicken.........years ago the chicken was this really thin shaved peppered chicken and I thought it was awful so I have since always ordered without chicken.However today Hubby chose the mac and chicken and I was surprised that now they use real chunks of shredded chicken breast!! YAY! What and improvement!! It was really good! (see pics). I got  the Turkey Bacon Cobb sandwich minus bacon =Layers of juicy oven-roasted turkey breast on grilled sourdough bread with sweet peppered bacon, sliced avocado, roasted tomatoes, sprouts and mixed greens. Topped with rosemary dressing and Bleu cheese crumbles (see pics)It was better  than I expected, they forgot to put avocado on it though andthe bread was really really good and for being grilled it wasnt over saturated with grease.The onion rings could have been crispier but were OK.Lame waitress today she was new but whatever...she sucked!!~~#~0
A buddy of mine takes me to this place for dinner, usually, and once for breakfast. It's an interesting place. As others have noted, be prepared to wait a while for service and don't be afraid to go get your waiter if you're feeling abandoned. Also, there may be a wait for a table, and the environment is loud, so be prepared to shout a bit if it's busy. They have beer-tasting on certain nights. I did not partake, but my Dad (who was visiting AZ) did. The food varies in quality (or perhaps just varies in quality of recipe?). My Orange Table friend and I shared a 'special' pork chop dish, and that was pretty blah. However, I highly recommend their grilled cheese sandwich on some sort of yummy bread (the lower end cheese sandwich ~ I have yet to try the fancy one). As for breakfast, I don't recall it being particularly spectacular, but I think it was better than your average diner breakfast. I may have to go back to try again... The flavored iced coffee seems very evil and full of calories, but it is really quite good. That did stand out!Orange Table is recommended if you want a place to chill and chat with your friends. Just try to find out what others are eating so that you pick something good from the menu. : )~~#~0
I just celebrated my birthday at Oregano's.  I had the best server I have had the pleasure of meeting in a lonnnnng time.  ASK FOR ALEXANDRA.  Knowledgable, adorable!, attentive, funny, and charming to boot!  Amazing pizza and salad, fab cocktails we'd never heard of, and to-die-for dessert.  All per her recommendations.  Can't wait to come here again.~~#~1
There's just something about this place I don't like.I love the wine listI love dim lighting, caves, couches, sausage and cheese platters....Just can't put my finger on it, but I would rather sit at the bar at Cowboy Ciao then have to hang out here.  *Shrug*The bartenders were a bit snotty last time I was there... maybe that's it.  Hmph.~~#~0
The meat shop has 100% grass fed beef, which means that they also finish their beef with grass (alfafa) which cant be said for every place that claims to have grass fed beef.  This is great if you are trying to eat food the way its supposed to be, none of that factory farming...However the same can't be said for the pork.  The pork (or at least the bacon) contains nitrates which keeps me from eating it.  The farm that provides the pork also feeds the pigs grain.This place would be perfect if they were able to get pigs and chickens that are pastured centered and not fed grain as part of their diets.  Until then I'll stick to their great prices on the grass fed beef and obtain my chickens and pork from somewhere else.~~#~0
OMG try their breakfast burritos!!!!  Habanero's has good, cheap, fast Mexican food.~~#~1
Awesome pizza! Wednesday half off bottles of wine is great for a ladies or date night. Nice bar and patio area.~~#~0
Went there last night with no expectations. From the beginning to the end, including the "bread basket" with blue cheese butter and pesto on top, the lamb chop appetizer, the sea bass entree, and the creme brulee in a flaky phillo cup lightly burnt on top, it was probably one of the best overall meals I've had in years. Thanks Eddie for stopping by our table and checking on us and chatting a bit. Very friendly wait staff and no attitude whatsoever from anybody and very comfortable. This place is a model for how it should be done.~~#~1
I purchased the Enotria groupon when it was released last year and had a horrible experience at the restaurant.1) I ordered a cheese platter. The platter was very much overpriced at over $18.00. The most problematic thing is that Enotria ordered the food from another restaurant on Mayo Blvd and had it delivered to them. The same is true with Pizza. If you order pizza there, it will be delivered from another restaurant in the Mayo shopping plaza. Enotria is taking a significant markup on the food because they are paying another vendor for it. AVOID THIS!!2) Another disturbing aspect of the visit was that we were served disproportionately small portion because we were using a groupon. We ordered two glasses of red wine. The waiter (who also happened to be the owner) served us a glass that was 1/3 of what is typically served.The only positive aspect of Enotria is that they have a good selection of wines. To be sincere, you are much better off going to a more reputable establishment in the area like White Chocolate Grill.Oh, also keep in mind that the current owner bought the restaurant over a year ago. It has changed ownership several times and the overall quality is suffering because of this.AVOID.~~#~1
Well, apparently Netflix just wasn't down with the whole "Extraordinarily Happy Customers" and "Providing Tremendous Value For The Money" business model that I raved about in my previous review.They're now changing their pricing structure so the One DVD At A Time "unlimited" package is $7.99 and the Watch Instantly unlimited package is also $7.99. So $15.98 together. They used to be $9.99 together. I'm keeping the "Watch Instantly" package for now, but the $7.99 for "One DVD At A Time" is just ridiculous. Yeah, they have a quick turnaround, but it's still the mail. You'd have to be a pretty hardcore movie watcher to get a better value out of an $8/month "unlimited" Netflix plan than just renting 8 $.99 movies at Blockbuster or Redbox. So yeah, I guess they're okay. The Watch Instantly service is still a decent deal. But "One DVD at a Time" is a total rip-off, and I never thought I'd use the word "rip-off" to describe Netflix.~~#~0
Husband and I have been trying to go to Urban Cookies for a while now. For one reason or another we kept missing its store hours. We finally made it today, and boy, were we glad. I had a vanilla cupcake and he had the urban cookie, which has chocolate chips and walnuts. The cookie was the perfect balance of moist and crispy. The guy behind the counter told us that the vanilla cupcakes was a special, but when they rotated it out people yelled at them. After taking one bite, I totally understood why. The cupcake is the best I've ever had. The vanilla frosting is not too sweet, perfectly creamy and melts in your mouth. I just hope they get more business so they can expand their hours!~~#~1
3 stars on any given day, my server PAT made this a fun experience and was the extra 2 stars.  Pat is one of the few people in this world who really enjoys being good at what he does.  I asked him, "how long" and with much joy he replied, "I can get your food in 10-15 minutes".  Sure enough it took 9 minutes.  I value time and in my business my word is everything.  Pat understands this and when I eat here again I will insist on his table.  I recommend you do the same.  ASK FOR PAT!!!Top notch Pat.  Don't ever change.~~#~1
Five stars is truly deserved For Yasu. This is truly the best sushi in town and some of the best I ever had! I am a big seafood lover and there a lot of "chain sushi" places in Arizona that are decent and good for rolls, but if you want quality and authentic Japanese style fish and incredible Sashimi, you need to go to Yasu. There is really no way to describe it till you go, but once you do, you will become an instatnt fan! Best thing to do is sit at the sushi bar and ask Yasu to make whatever he wants! You won't be disappointed. The area and building are misleading... However, if you are the kind of person that thinks RA is the best thing since sliced bread and nothing can beat it, this is probably not for you. This is real sushi...Go try and enjoy!~~#~1
please please please do not stay here! i never do these reviews but i feel obligated to save someone the time and money and self respect by writing this review! the customer service is soooo soooo poor!! after having almost 500.00 held on my charge card after i checked out, i called to find out why this charge was on my account.  i was hung up on and after calling back was repeatedly hung up on and refused to provide his name to me or his managers name! i told him i work at a four star hotel and casino in las vegas (which i do). he called me a liar! .. and as of right now still out 500.00! what establishment hangs up on their guests? this guy should sit through some of the forbes training i have received! what if i was a shopper? do not stay here! save your money! they only received one star because you have to provide a rating.  aside from the horrible customer service, they stuck me with a 50 penalty fee when i had to change locations. that wasnt great, but whatever, the pictures do not resemble the motel. the "game room" is not a game room.  its a room with an atari in it.  the pool was small and dirty and if you like noise all night while you are trying to sleep, you can count on it here.  all these things, i could get over. however, the customer service the man (i cant even say gentleman) on the phone was horrible and penalty should follow. he is an embarrassment to all of us who work in guest services. do not stay here! you would have a better stay in a box outside on a corner.i should have known better for such an inexpensive place, but i was hoping if we cut back on the hotel we could spend extra money with the kids doing activities and going places... wrong! you get what you pay for... and worse!~~#~1
I have always enjoyed the quesdillas at Chili's. Try their happy hour where they offer bottled and draft beers. There chicken tenders are okay but they are breaded and I do not care for breaded chicken tenders but rather the grilled ones which they do not offer. The salsa here is not very good, I have tasted store bought salsa that tastes much better. The best thing Chili's has to offer is the happy hour.~~#~0
Chicken wings and cheeseburger meal... Yummmayyyyever since i've moved away from arizona, i can honestly say that china grill is what i miss most.. their chicken fried rice is really good and so is their cheeseburger.. their general tso's chicken extra spicy is my bf's favorite.. almost everything is good here!!~~#~1
I can't really say enough about Liberty Market. The place is beautiful, comfortable, friendly and the service is awesome. I haven't had anything that I didn't like. From the wood fired pizza to the delectable salads, everything on the menu is worth every penny. For me though, it's all about the Cortadito (espresso drink) and the pastries. These are completely off the chart awesome! You simply MUST try them!Another great plus to this place is that on just about any given day, you can visit and see Joe (the owner), hanging out, chatting with customers and all around having a great time. Joe is truly one of the nicest and most sincere people I have ever met. Makes Liberty Market all the more worth visiting.Oh! As weird as it sounds, you have to check out the bathrooms, they are the best I have ever seen. (seriously)~~#~1
Eh.It's alright. If you want to have a couple of drinks and watch chicks make complete fools of themselves on the mechanical bull, be my guest.  For food and other, don't bother.I suppose the crowd is a nice change of pace amongst Old Town's usual suspects but if you go expecting a bunch of cowboys (and cowgirls), best to turn around and go up north.  Somewhere.  Far.The food's crap, the service (at least the server we had) was nice but a little slow (or deaf? or on something?). I will give it 3 stars, 1 for crowd, 1 for entertainment, and 1 for just being different.  Word of advice, skip the nachos my friends.*** Edit: My boyfriend would probably give this place 5 stars for the music they play.  Lot's of rock, some heavy metal, old hair bands, and some new stuff mixed in there.  No Rap.I give it that much.  It was definitely good music.~~#~0
Michael came out today and he was great! Our patio door was a bear to open and he put new hardware on and voila! It seriously opens with 1 finger. He was quick, affordable, knowledgeable and very nice. Scheduling was easy and the office staff was kind. A+!~~#~1
I think the lady behind the counter didn't like me.  Could've just been me.  I don't know.  It's just how I felt.When my boss first told me about this place, I thought he said "Al Molina" and I was like, "You mean the guy who played Doc Ock in Spider-Man II?"I've been here a few times, today was the first time I'd been to El Molino in about 8 months.  I happened to be in the area, popping in to buy a backpack at Staples an decided to get a burrito to go to munch on when I got back to my office.One thing I really didn't like was that you had to ask for the key to use the bathroom.  That's something very typical of, like, a gas station that bums use to shit on the floor.  I went to the bathroom and it said I had to ask for the key.  I went back to the counter and the woman disappeared in the back so I kinda just did a little pee-pee dance until she came back.It was a little too expensive for what it was.  A thing of chips was like $4.50.  That's crazy.  Granted, the chips are really good and you get a lot of em, but... don't you have a thing of chips I can buy for a buck that comes with a much more reasonable portion?  I got all these chips in the fridge at work that won't be edible on Monday, probably.The burrito I got was very tasty.  The salsa they gave me was also super good.  Nice and smokey and spicy.  Seriously.  Man, that shit was spicy.  I kind of have a soar throat today so that spiciness felt super good to me.I had to laugh when I opened up my to-go back once I got back to work because I actually thought maybe I didn't get ANY salsa, but when I took a look they gave me soooo much.  I made a small tower beside my meal, like a Stonehenge of heat.Three stars:  Good.  Not great.  Weird bathroom.  Unfriendly lady.  Good food.  Too expensive.~~#~0
I had such high expectaions after reading reviews but I was so disappointed.  The food was not good, the service was awful.  They got all of our orders mixed upo. Will never go back and cannot recommend this place.  PS  one dish was good and some enjoyed the soup.  There are 100 places I will visit before returning to this place.~~#~1
Where else can you go in Chandler the will transport you to another country for free in a flash!!I like to shop here and explore the foods of other countries.  This is not just an Oriental Supermarket, they are a World Market.  Each aisle jets you to a different culture or country.I wish most of all their sake selection was better but oh well, they are bound by the limitations of their distributors.I will be there again soon for a mini-staycation!!!!~~#~1
This review is pretty much for the bra department at Nordstrom. They are amazing at their jobs. I finally found out that Victoria's Secret is that their bras suck! So I bought a bra online to pick up at the store, but when I went in and tried it on, it didn't fit. I thought that sizes for that brand ran a little differently. I told the sales girl, and she asked me if I minded if she measured me. I said sure and she followed me into the dressing room. When we got in there she told me to take off my top! I'll be honest here, I thought she was going to measure me over my shirt, and I almost peed a little. I decided to pretend like it was no big deal to take my top off in front of a total stranger, and just took it off. Not sure if she noticed my slight hesitation, but she probably did, oh well. I generally like to go on a couple of dates before I take my top off if you know what I am saying.Well guess what? That is the best way to get a good measurement it turns out! The salesgirl told me to wait a few moments and she would be back with some bras. She came back with two of the most wonderful, comfortable, and supportive bras I have ever owned! So instead of getting one bra that day, I got two.I have to say, my hat (or my top) is off to Nordstrom for training their staff to be great at their jobs, and for having fabulous bras. Ladies, please don't bother buying another bra at Victoria's Secret! Run to Nordstrom next time you need a quality bra to support your girls. :)~~#~1
If you want a school that cares more about your financial aid money than you, this is the school for you. Education is horrible. If you are a democrat, don't speak your mind; you will be considered a reject from day one. I got 100% on my graduate papers and think I did not contribute anything to the fields. This institution is a joke.~~#~1
I was there last week with my sisters and while we ordered our steaks cooked medium, all of them came out well done. Kind of disappointed, but oh well.So last night my fiance and I had a buy-one-get-one-free coupon, so we headed over. When I ordered my steak cooked medium, I asked her to make a point of it when she put the order in because of the issue last week.When our food came out, she asked me to cut into my steak and make sure it was cooked the way I wanted. I did and, while it was a bit more medium-well than medium, I was hungry and it looked good, so I gave it the go ahead and we started our meal. It really was a good steak.When our waitress came out again, she double checked that my steak was cooked correctly. I assured her it was fine. A few minutes later a manager came out and apologized for my steak being over done and offered to replace it. I assured him it was maybe a little overdone, but it was good and I was happy with my meal. They were being very nice and showing some great customer service, though a little overzealous. :)When the bill came, they had made my steak the free one for the coupon, even though mine was the more expensive of the two meals we ordered.Great customer service, and very good food.~~#~1
They serve alot of food.~~#~0
I love sprinkles cupcakes. I have also managed to go to every location except the 3 in so cal. Like every location, the taste and quality is consistent and delicious. I got the salt caramel, banana, and carrot this time around. Like always, it's delicious and lasts for as long as they say it does. My pup loves the pupcakes too. I would wait for these cupcakes any time.~~#~1
My favorite place by far and well worth the drive from Gilbert. Love the atmosphere, bruschetta, and of course the wine. Great place to catch up with friends. I can't wait for the location in Gilbert to open up.~~#~1
My husband and I went there for our first time today. What a mistake. First of all, the ladies bathroom had no soap or paper towels to wash/dry your hands. My husband had the steak sandwich and I had the chicken ranch. There was so little meat on the sandwiches that we were perplexed when we were finished.  The inside trash was overflowing. I have been sick to my stomach the last hour....never again.~~#~1
This place was the answer to my German grocery shopping dreams! I thank the Yelp community for leading me to Old Heidelberg. I was picking up a number of items for an Oktoberfest party I was cooking for and hosting at my house, and was able to fulfill most of my exotic German needs at this one stop. I picked up pumpernickel rye bread, authentic concentrated Maggi Würze seasoning (not the soy sauce-tasting stuff you find in most American grocery stores) and Knorr zwiebel-kräuter salat krönung. They also had lots of Knorr sauce mixes that you just can't find over here (for instance,  sauerbraten gravy).I stuck around for a few minutes to talk to the two women who ran the place (Andrea and Chris). I volunteered that I had lived in Germany for years, including Berlin and Bavaria.  They were totally friendly and even suggested some other places nearby that I could check out for German grub or rarer German beer selections. I promised I would be back... especially since I spotted that they had frozen leberknödel (liver dumplings). I made these once from scratch years ago but that was a lot of work. Knowing that they carry such delicacies has snagged me hook, line and sinker, as I am now destined to return and once again indulge my German food fantasies.~~#~1
Oh Porter, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways... I had a, ah, as in just one, porter and was feelin' fine. And I was extremely glad to have the sweet potato fries instead of the regular ones with my sammie. Our waitress was pleasant, prompt and next time I'm going to ask to be seated outside or at a high top table. Our booth was great for chatting with my friend, but I like a little people watching at the pub!Now, if you are avoiding SunUp because you remember that there used to be something called  the Sonora Brewhouse in that same space.... You're in luck!! The brewmaster, Uva, is still there, still brewing his witches draught. But now, you won't get them confused with the Sonoran Brewing Co. in north Scottsdale. Hooray!~~#~0
Barrio Cafe is a favorite of mine, the margarita's before you get seated are a must.  When in season the pomegranate guacamole is second to none.  A refreshing escape from the cookie cutter chain restaurants.  When you go go with friends and don't have a schedule as the wait can be long, but worth it.~~#~1
I will make this real easy for you. Just go to in-and-out Burger if you don't want to feel gross and poor.~~#~1
I'm usually one to prefer chicken - but when the only option for tacos is steak you go with it.  I ordered the taco and was rewarded with tender steak with lots of flavor.  Our lunch crew has gone back several times and the service is always fast and friendly.  For the size and price - order multiples.  Love the salsa bar.  Adding cucumbers is now my favorite treat.~~#~1
I have have given it 3 stars, but my partner gave it 4, just keep that in mind.I had wanted to check this place out from the first time I saw it, and when it came up on Groupon, it was fate. My partner is a sandwich lover, so it was perfect.Firstly, they didn't have a lot of vegetarian options, which I found disppointing. I'm so sick of my only sandwich choices being either tomato/basil/mozz or lettuce/tomato/cheese...and that's pretty much what they had here. I went with the caprese option.Warning; when they say fire roasted tomatoes, they mean WHOLE tomatoes on bread. Now, I'm ok with a few tomato slices here or there, but giant squishy tomatoes looming over a few spare pieces of (fresh) basil and (fresh) mozzerella? So not appetizing. I ate what I could, but was not impressed.My partner, however, made her own sandwich with Turkey, cheese, and some veggies, and she loved it. I agree that the bread was good, and I enjoyed the popcorn chips (rather than potato). The staff was incredibly nice, although the service was a bit slow, and the seating options were a bit odd (and not very accessible for those with disabilities).I wouldn't PLAN on coming here, but if we were in the neighborhood, I'd stop by.~~#~0
OH this shop makes me want to lose a hip or something just to fit into their clothing!!  I found not one thing in larger sizes, but my friend, who's a size 8, found LOTS of awesome vintage clothes...including, yes ladies and gentlemen, a 70s JUMPSUIT!  I am drooling and green with envy, but alas, I couldn't find anything.  Go here if you're thin (or just want to torture yourself by staring at all the awesome clothes that won't fit you unless you chop off some body part you probably need).~~#~0
I had lunch today at CASK 63 with a banker to discuss our collective power to create business in the Phoenix Market. I HAD THE ABSOLUTE BEST CRAB SALAD, I've had since leaving the Gulf Coast of Mississippi. Red Crab Salad....fresh, clean, sweet, crisp..light...in a very well appointed setting. Very  good iced teas as well....hard to find in Phoenix.....Go there...Eat there...you will like it..and we might see one another...who knows...be like nike..just do it...:)~~#~1
I woke up late on a Saturday, and I was craving Indian food! To my relief, it was almost lunch time! I remembered that there was an Indian restaurant close to me that I had been meaning to try. I headed to Flavors of India to try their lunch buffet. I walked in and I was immediately greeted. I noted the Bollywood videos playing in the background, I love those dang videos. The host was also my waiter. He invited me to help myself to the buffet. I'm not one of those people that knows the names of each and every dish. As I write this I'm kicking myself for not taking notes. As a whole, the buffet was a-ok. Nothing in particular knocked my socks off. I did notice that nothing was powerfully flavorful. It was kind of a "safe" seasoning restaurant. I would visit Flavors of India again. There was plenty of food, the buffet had a lot of variety, and the service was good!~~#~0
I really wasn't impressed. Came here with some friends to grab some takeout, and nothing really made me smile. The al pastor was 'meh', at best. The carne asada wasn't particularly noteworthy, and though the vampiro was tasty, there wasn't anything hugely redeeming about it. Nothing to write home about.Sucks, because my friends in Arizona swear by this place. I'm giving it three stars more out of courtesy to them, but my own personal experience here wasn't anything over two. The people who worked here were very friendly...  I've heard that the ceviche is the bomb diggity... I wish I could come back here and give it a better review, because I'm sure that next time would be better, but as it stands right now, I'm just not a huge fan.Sorry guys!~~#~0
"The office space, layout, presentation gets 5 stars, the customer service you receive from the employees at Corporate Office Center is a negative 10. They will scare your clients off, scare your own staff and make your life a living hell. Their office locations and space is beautiful but if a say, a client shows up at a time other than their scheduled time, they will be told to leave. They will be told you don't provide any services at the locations and if anyone could single handedly ruining your professional image, Corporate Office Centers can do this for you! BE AFRAID!!!! They are dedicated to working against, not with you."~~#~1
been coming here since birth~~#~1
This place is great but not if you have kids.  It mentioned on yelp that it is kids friendly, but they don't even have a table changer in their bathrooms.  I was there with my 2 year nephew and had to take him to the car to change his dirty diaper.  If you call a place kids friendly, you might think about accomodating and have a table changer in your bathrooms both in Potino and LGO.~~#~0
This place is pretty good for a chain, and it's very easy to find something for everyone here. The staff has always been friendly, and the menu is huge! The food is just okay though. Would return with friends or for convenience, but we would not go on our own.~~#~0
Cute place!  Nice drive-thru window.  Adorable, really.  Nice patio-dining/lounging.  Noise-level inside was a little loud, but there were eight people, six of w/c were talkative yelpers (ha!), plus Kyle and Chad, owners of D'lish (who were, btw, easy on the eyes... a great asset for any business!).One special request- please offer Maya Chai!  While Oregon Chai tastes OK, I'm allergic (I suspect there are "natural flavors" involved), and organic Maya Chai is multiple-times better (and, most importantly, I don't recall feeling negative effects after)!Great spot to unwind and rejuvenate.  Will come back soon to try the food!~~#~0
I've never had any real problems with this store.  It is your typical lower income neighborhood grocer.  What really bugs me about ALL the Fry's stores is their waste with receipts.  Call me a hippy, but more than half of the receipt paper has nothing to do with my purchase.  I buy 1 item and they hand me a receipt 12 inches long!  With all the stores doing that it equates to many thousands of pounds of paper wasted every year unnecessarily!  Hundreds of trees are dying because these guys just don't give a shit.Ya, ya, I know, it's probably the least of this companies waste issues, but it's one that's handed to me every time I shop there, staring me in the face.  I don't like it and I don't like supporting it.~~#~0
Well, what a pleasant surprise!  I stopped by with my children to check it out - planning to eat elsewhere because my daughter eats gluten-free, etc., etc.  Then I met Payton Curry and realized what he and the Brat Haüs are all about.  Great food and a desire to serve!  Payton delivered on fantastic organic salads that were gluten, egg, dairy, and soy-free and tasted great!  And he threw in a few organic surprises.  Now I have a place to eat phenomenal Moroccan lamb hot dogs while my daughter can enjoy healthy food.  On our second trip, Payton remembered us and came out to let us know he had made some falafel (in the shape of a sausage, of course) and offered my daughter one in a salad or a lettuce wrap.  She chose the wrap (more fun) and loved it.  I have NEVER had personalized service like this!  Cool place, cool patio, great beer selection, great-tasting unique food selections, and, best of all, great people!  Congrats Dave and Payton!~~#~1
It doesn't matter which location you go to, it's all the same and GREAT!!!~~#~1
There's the sweetest (and cutest) guy who works there and one time, my total came to 5.45, i had a 5 in my hand as I was scraping for change in my dance bag but he was like "its on me." and took it from his tips! I know its just 45 cents and i could probably find that under the seats in my car but he truly made my day with something so little like that! I LOVE this place!! :D~~#~1
Five Guys offers a decent burger, but it's definitely overcooked--they brag about serving them well done and there's no argument here: that's what they are. But I much prefer the flavor of Smashburger's meat. Five Guys seemed rather devoid of meaningful seasoning, or if it was there, it was killed in the well-doneing. I also didn't really like that it comes out as two carelessly charred mini-patties, instead of one, nicely cooked and seasoned burger.As far as Mill-area burgers are concerned, I'm at the following:1.Smashburger  2. Chuckbox 3.  In N Out 4. Five Guys 5. FatburgerAnd Chuckbox and Smashburger are awfully close. I've been a HUGE fan of Chuckbox for forever, so many I like the newness of Smashburger, but damn is it tasty. I also prefer the Smashfries to Chuckbox's fries, but I think I prefer 5 Guys' fries to both of them.Finally, the price is obnoxious. You're not getting that much in the way of a burger for $11 (drink + fries + cheeseburger). You get a MOUNTAIN of fries, but I don't NEED that many fries. You also get to top it with just about anything, but I don't want to subsidize other people's toppings. Let me pay $2 less to get mine with lettuce, ketchup, and mayo.Overall a meh burger. Not great, but better than Fatburger, if I don't want to walk to College for great burgerness.Oh, as for atmosphere, it was like a club in there. I really don't need to be bombarded with music at lunch when I'm going to talk to someone. I hate shouting and the few times when the song would switch and the grill would quiet was like the eye of the storm. Turn that shit down.~~#~0
Door clearly says drive-thru open 24 hours and lobby till midnight. Drove up at 10:30 and was told the lobby was closed...lame...~~#~1
Oooh, this is my favorite lunch place by my office.  Super nice staff, delicious bagels.  Go for the lox special thing, it's amazing.~~#~1
I came here with me sister Cher, who really likes this place. I'm so used to food being prepared by cooks and brought to me. So, I'm not used to having to prepare my own food via restaurant. I love to cook from recipes, so why should this be any different, right? As we arrived there wasn't that many people, I was relieved and allowed me to ask my sister 101 questions about what to do. I ended up making a concoction of beef, carrots, broccoli, rice noodles, sprouts with chef's favorite sauce. It turned out good but I know that I was missing something. I tried some of my sisters bowl and that was really good.So, this place is a build-your-own bowl, piled high if necessary, and watch it cook right in front of you.It was a little overwhelming at first, but if I continue to go there, I will get accustomed to the process.~~#~0
BEST PANCAKES!!! We want the recipe. They're newly remodeled and better than ever. Always great bagels but now they have added more menu items, more choices. Great food, great people!~~#~1
I have been trying to get into a consistent workout routine for years... I've tried it all! gym memberships, pilates, training for a marathon but was never able to stick with anything... until Karve that is! My husband found it for me on here actually and thought I should try it (not sure what he was trying to hint at with that... but i love my improved Karve body too much now to care :)Anyway, I went and am now hooked! it is the greatest work out ever - its hard but the results happen so quickly that its motivating... and its really the only workout routine that I've ever been able to stick with ever!  and with going multiple times a week I found that it even changed my appetite - I no longer feel annoying cravings so eating healthier is easier for me (a former carb/chocolate fiend)It really helped me finally get into a more active/healthy lifestyle - I know that sounds so cliche but I'm still shocked everyday that a lazyass/sweets-eating like me is actually working out on a regular basis - and its all bc of the great method of Karve.... plus the instructors are SO sweet and nice/friendly and supportive I'm honestly making friends there... all in all a stellar review for Karve Studio!! i'm a believer :)~~#~1
Whenever my brother is in town he always stays here so when the hubby & I were looking for a place to get away for a night we stayed here. We are the not the party crowd which is why we chose to stay here on a Tuesday after a holiday weekend. Here is my take on Hotel Valley Ho: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.Good:1) Gigantic, comfy bed. I slept like a queen.2) Private balcony with large chaise lounge and sitting area.3) Outstanding bathroom. The tub is separate from the shower which is and the toliet has a room all to itself.4) Cool decor both interior and exterior. Bad:1) Bed pillows were too squishy. 2) Toliet paper/bath tissue was surprisingly rough. I would expect a hotel of this caliber to have a softer tissue.3) The mini bar and console are fully stocked with an assortment of spirits, but no coffee or tea. Not everyone that stays here drinks his/herself into a stupor.Ugly:1) Parking is $15 per day, but you have the option to self park which doesn't cost a thing so I guess that's not really "ugly".Overall, we had a lovely stay at Hotel Valley Ho and look forward to our next visit.~~#~1
Coffee-meh. Not great, not horrible.Scone-dry.Service-ridiculously slow.The night we were there (8/11), the owner came and asked a group of people (who were clearly having some sort of meeting) to stop talking because they were "disturbing the guitar player." Chased 8 paying customers (at least I assume they were paying customers; they all had drinks) out the door. Weird!! Don't think I'll be going back.~~#~1
Took my family here for dinner.  The hamburgers were really good.  I had the regular charburger, and i liked it quite a bit.  It was better than most of the fast food chains, but I'd rank it below the higher end burgers from places like Fuddruckers or Red Robin.   For the price though, I was very satisfied.  My 8 year old really liked her charburger with cheese, but my other daughters did not like the grilled cheese at all.  I was not impressed by either the regular or sweet potato fries, but the onion rings were good.  We did not get any dessert, although the sundaes and milk shakes looked really appealing.  We'll try those next time.~~#~0
I would've gone 2 stars if I were more forgiving. I could reason that it was the end of the day, that a big crowd of wayward children had just come through, or that a hurricane had blown out the back of the restaurant. But then, I tasted it.It looks as if Yogurtini is pretty well-loved around these parts, and I'm sorry to report otherwise. It's was like a bomb had gone off. The tables were filthy, the machine handles were all gunked up, there was assorted debris on the floor. The two teenagers working were too busy gossiping about who knows what to do their jobs. When we walked in there were a few customers sampling flavors among the ruins, with no employees in sight. We grabbed some sample cups from the register and dodged napkins and froyo puddles (and other customers) to try some different flavors. The levers are the type that if you pull just a bit too far you make a mess all over your hand, especially when trying to squirt a tiny bit in a sample cup. This mess is then added to the greater mess of everyone else attempting this same operation, and no-one attempting to clean it up.The stuff was real overpowering, to where instead of tasting like what it was supposed to taste like, it was bordering on medicine or like a bad imitation of what it was supposed to be. Like, cheesecake doesn't taste like that, good cheesecake anyway... And neither does cake batter, or banana. Where did the yogurt part go? And how do you screw up cookies and cream, exactly? The two that were the best (and most edible) were the Irish mint and the red velvet, and that's what we mostly ended up with.The decor didn't add to our experience. Everything is a mint green, but it doesn't come off as retro or even minty, but more like dated and hospital-like. Some people really like it but I found it unappetizing.A surly teenager magically appeared as we approached the register, only to disappear again soon after we paid. We sat down at a dirty table and dealt with our choices while the two teens again made an appearance, half-mopping-half-attempting-to-clean while chattering back and forth about their dating woes. We finished our yogurt but both strongly considered abandoning the whole affair.I very well could have walked into Yogurtini at the worst possible time on the worst possible day, with all the factors stacked against them, but I won't be returning to find out if this was the case.~~#~1
I had the Gnocchi in Shitake Dijon Cream Sauce, and it was unreal.  Cute little place.  I didn't sit to eat so I can't comment on the service, but they were extremely amicable when I ordered my take out.~~#~1
The 3 employees were so busy talking to each other they couldn't remember what we ordered, kept having to ask, and still didn't get it right.  In the midst of the three employees continuing in their personal chaos, my husband finally said, "ok, time out! I'm the customer.  Make our sandwiches and then take care of your issues.". They stopped for a split second, all three looked at us, then they actually IGNORED us, finished their conversation, then finished our sandwiches.  We were the only ones in there and we really were shocked!  Good thing I like avacado, because it ended up on my sandwich & I didn't order it, and after telling the girl, she said, "I thought you said...". Still had the order wrong!  Whew!~~#~1
One of my fondest memories as a child is traveling to Alameda to visit my great-grandparents, one of which was Filipino. The food! Yum!!! It had been years since either my mom or I had Filipino food. We both moved to Arkansas 20+ years ago but I recently moved to the valley. The first time I came across Hey Joe was last Spring when my mom was in town and we visited the Old Town Scottsdale Farmer's Market. Pancit? Lumpia? I was beyond excited when I saw the truck. Yes, I get excited about good food.Everything was fabulous. I have since tried the breakfast dish which was absolutely delicious. Service is great, prices are wonderful. I will definitely be back.~~#~1
This place was the worst place to EVER live! I lived here from Aug 2010 to may 2011, i was always in the office see when the grates would be fixed?? the office always gave me the run around very rude. You would think after the gun shoots, assaults, and car break ins that they would fix the gates but nope and to this day they still aren't fixed. When we moved in they said they would be fixed in a week and they lied.  Also the gym is huge but NONE of the equipment works! living here was SO gross! nothing worked our neighbors are Mexican thugs doing drug cat calling at anything that walks it was gross. I hated living here!  But the worst part was a few weeks ago we get a call from collections saying we owe Scottsdale Springs $300 bucks over 10 months after moving out! I called them up like wtf, and they were SO rude said too bad pay it or your credit score will hurt, we even gave a fowarding address and we NEVER got a letter in the mail about any damages. They claim we never gave them a forwarding address which is bull. I really hope people read these reviews i would hate to see anyone else scammed by this god awful company!~~#~1
Thank you so much for the good reviews. I went here for a business meeting 8-13-2010. I ate soo much I hurt myself. Everything was great I especially loved the lamb and chicken curry. The staff was excellent and very kind. I will recommend my new favorite Indian food restaurant to everyone. ;)~~#~1
This is seriously one of my favorite restaurants of all time. I've been many times and it's always fabulous. I LOVE their Mahi Mahi Tacos - they are so good! I also highly recommend the Pork Osco Bucco, Smoked Red Chile Pork Roast, and the Cowboy Beef Stew. The nightly specials are often very creative and delicious. This place is also good for Sunday brunch. Good bartender too - drinks are never too weak.~~#~1
This awesome park and recreation center makes me wish we lived in Peoria. We were here today for a FRAG (reef tank geeks) picnic and the whole area is new and beautiful with lots of different amenities. We saw sand volleyball courts, a spashground (with critters spouting water) for the little kids, a skate park packed with older kids, picnic ramadas, fishing areas, baseball fields, batting cages, and a duck pond. There is even a Starbuck's.We were at the group ramada BBQ pavilion, the likes of which I have never seen before. It was a huge covered circle of about a dozen BBQ grills with ventilation hoods hanging above and a cement "bar" from which to serve on the outside circle and smaller cement "tables" behind on which to do prep work. There were also sinks in the center to wash up. Surrounding this circle of grills were corresponding ramadas with picnic tables numbered for your group. What a fantastic set up! Great job, Peoria!~~#~1
If you like P.F. Changs, you will love Pei Wei! It's essentially the same thing in a less formal dining setting, & Take-Out! I can't tell a difference between their Orange Chicken, or the lettuce wraps minus the price tag!!!My favorite dish here is the Dan-Dan Noodles! (It's Hot. Spicy, & Pure Indulgence Pleasure for under $10!!!)If you have not heard; "Pei Wei is not authentic Asian food!" Well neither is Panda Express, but I'll tell you Pei Wei is better than Panda Express & most Authentic Asian restaurants in the US! Yes I said most Authentic Asian restaurants! (NO MSG!)"Can you believe the balls on this guy!?"We'll I have had Chinese food in China Towns in San Francisco, LA, NY, Vancouver & Dallas! I've even had Peking Duck in Hong Kong; don't be impressed it was not that good! I love Chinese food, but I really love Asian Fusion! Roy's, PF Changs, & Pei Wei really wet my noodle!The other nice thing about Pei Wei is their take out! I have them on speed dial...So when I'm on my way home from work I'll call, & as I pull in I pay, pick up, and go! It's freshly cooked & No Wait!!!~~#~1
They finally just opened a Rita's location in Surprise!! I think it just opened yesterday or today, but it's just as good as the one on Union Hills and 83rd Avenue.  I told my co-workers about it and we basically have been driving by during our lunch break just waiting for it to open over the past few months.It's hard to explain the texture of the ice. It's thicker than the ice in a frozen margarita, yet it's not crunchy or unrefined like an Icee drink. Sonic has similar ice, but I feel like it's just not as good as Rita's. I guess that's why it's Italian ice. It's in its own category!There are 3 main types: Gelati's (custard-ice-custard), Blendini's (custard-ice-custard with mix ins like Oreos, M&Ms, etc), and Mistos (ice-custard drink). You can also get just regular custard alone or flavored ice alone. One of their most famous ice flavors is Swedish Fish. There's also a sugar substitute version of their ice and today's sugar free ice flavor was Pineapple. I tried a Red Velvet Cake Gelati today with vanilla custard and it was nothing less than amazing!The menu is a little confusing since there are so many choices. There are mainly only 2 types of custards though, vanilla and chocolate, that can be mixed with the 12 flavors of ice that consistently change. Before, I was solely a fan of ice cream and yogurt. Now, I am grateful that my sister-in-law dragged me here, because there is nothing quite like it yet! Now I will always compare Italian ices to this place.~~#~1
After several hundred professional massages over the past 20 years, I encountered today a first -- a massage therapist who explained that she could not do a massage involving any but mild pressure using her hands. It was an issue of "protecting the thumbs." When I told her I didn't like forearms and elbows, she explained that she'd never worked without using her forearms (and, I assume, her elbows, too). After just five minutes, when I asked for more pressure, she suggested we stop the massage -- that she wasn't the "therapist for [me]." She was right. What are they teaching these people these days, and why doesn't an excellent outfit like LifeTime Fitness insist on better skills among its massage staff? I won't offer her name, but, if considering a massage at this establishment, I suggest Casie as the only therapist here worth the money.~~#~1
This place has to get all five stars. Ok, the area is a little suspect I will admit; that can be countered with the excellent food and excellent prices. This is the kind of food that goes for $12 - $15/plate if it were located in an upscale area.  They have done a great job with the interior and the food is really wonderful.5 Top reasons I love La Condesa: ~ Beautiful food. Unique flavors.  ~ Great salsa bar: aver a dozen lovely hand made salsas; I liked them all ~ Price: you can spend under $7 and have a really good meal ~ Convelient: It is only a 2 minute drive from 24th & Camelback. ~ Atmosphere: the interior and the service create a great place to dine.***We eat out several times a week, and this place is now at the top of the list for my wife and I both.***~~#~1
Don't go to Dos for authentic Mexican food or stellar service, you'll be disappointed.  Go to Dos for a fun atmosphere, good Happy hour and cheap "bar" food... then you'll be pleased!  Dos usually hits the spot after a hot day at the baseball game or for a first stop before a night out on the town.  It has all the essentials, food, ATM, toilets and a huge selection of booze!~~#~0
LOVE it and so close to home!  Since Pita Jungle open in Glendale I have been at least once a week (Yes, really!)  The hummus and garlic dip are to die for and on my last trip I tried a Greek Pita-Oh my!  The fruit on the Caribbean salad and the fruit and cheese plate are amazing and the chicken combo plate is so large it's two meals!The ambiance is slightly different than the other locations but I think that is mostly due to the fact that two sides of the restaurant are glass.  Pita Jungle Glendale still features a revolving collection of art work and you can see the funky style of the other locations in the hand painted chairs and the cool artwork painted in the bathrooms.  The staff is also  extremely friendly.~~#~1
While the menu looked promising, have no idea if the food is any good since the hostess failed to even acknowledge our presence when we walked in the door.   We patiently stood there for several minutes while she walked around us to greet and seat two other parties.   Since we were still unable to get her attention,  we left and went to Tommy Bahama across the street.~~#~1
Awesome food and service!~~#~1
How did I not know this is right across the street from my house??I woudn't describe myself as a crafter or DIYer, but man this place has all kinds of fancy papers, from traditional to fun and contemporary! I bought these vintage anatomical papers that I plan to make posters from. The best part is that they were only $3.50!They even sell Japanese Copic markers, take that Az art supply!~~#~1
It was a little expensive.  $65.80 for two apps, one drink, two sodas, two entrees, and one shared dessert.Highlights:The Grilled Wings were very good.   Nice and crisp, charred but not burned, and not too fatty.  I could have eaten two dozen of them.The Cheddar Potatoes were a hit at the table, liked by all.The Creme Brulee was excellent, and about twice the size that Torched Goodness offers, for 5 cents less than TG charges.Lowlights:The hummus was just plain, and there was something else they put on top of it, something a little bitter - ??  Not sure what it was, but it was not impressive.The "half rack" of ribs were pretty tiny for $14.95.  Not a lot of meat.The Flatiron Steak was also tiny, and overcooked.  Not very tasty at all.Mashed potatoes and Mac-N-Cheese were very pedestrian.All in all, I might go back, have 2 orders of the wings app, and finish with Creme Brulee.  But I won't go with the kids again, not for $75 with tip.  We could have eaten 3 times at Los Taquitos for that price.~~#~0
Cashew brittle, almond brittle, bacon brittle!  Go now, before it's too late!~~#~1
Delicious gourmet crepes. Friendly staff. Awesome environment. Price is right. Eat here, it's good.~~#~1
Upon first look Pearl does not look like my type of place.  Trendy location/atmosphere often equals mediocre  food. Pearl is an exception to the rule. The sushi is creative and tasty and the drink specials rock. I love that they have different flavors for edamame, cheap bombers and did I mention the fish sticks are way to good. All of that would equal four stars in my book, fifth star is given to the staff. Steve is the type of bartender that others should aspire to be like. Knowledgeable and observant without being intrusive. Always goes the extra mile, I really appreciate how he makes my husband and I feel so comfortable. Overall great value and relaxed attitude.~~#~1
Excellent. Fresh and yummy!~~#~1
When I was growing up we called this the canal. In other parts of town it is still called the canal. In some places people actually fish from it. I think they die right after they eat their catch, which is why you don't see them very often. Over the years you periodically hear about dead bodies being found in the canal as well.  Google it.What is so annoying about this is that Scottsdale, is trying to make it seem like this isn't the same heinous canal that's always been there. When I heard about the development around the Scottsdale Waterfront, I couldn't figure out what they were talking about. What water? Then I started cracking up when I found out it was the canal.Come on Scottsdale, you can put a dress and lipstick on a pig, but it is still a pig. You are not fooling anyone.~~#~1
Service was slow and horrible. Got the steak and eggs.  Steak was half fat. Waiters response was "Oh!  We have a new supplier". He didnt take it back and charged us any way. Eggs were cold. Stay away from this place for eating. Bar looked happening.~~#~1
This is one of my favorite bars in the area.  The bar has a good vibe, the food is good, and the bartenders are attentive.  The prices are reasonable so you can have a good time without digging too deeply into your pockets.~~#~1
We really wanted to like Honey Bears. As far as BBQ goes, this was a perfectly average meal. My side salad was ok, corn was very good, pulled chicken was very dry and the roll it was on (got sliders) was store bought. No amount of sauce made the chicken juicier. Unfortunately the sauce had no character-was just sauce. While we are on that, flies were all around the sauce. My husbands ribs were ok but not very meaty. We are hitting all the BBQ joints in the area as we just moved here. We won't be going back here unfortunately.~~#~0
Wow! I can't believe this place gets so many good reviews. I was hauled here once by co-workers looking for a cheap meal. But, how much value does your lunch dollar have when you don't even want to eat the food? Dry and sticky rice; "white meat chicken" unidientifiable as such, and a sweet glaze that provided the only flavor. Quite frankly, it was disgusting, and none of the dishes my co-workers had looked any better (though they seemed to be fine with them). I should know to stay away from restaurants that have pictures of their menu items on the wall. The one star is only for the fast and friendly service.~~#~1
I liked the tiki theme and torch lights in the patio area. During the past few times that I came here, it was normally packed inside and I always ended up finding a seat outside. Since it was packed the last time I came, getting drinks took a while, but it wasn't too bad. Drinks were cheap and not stingy compared to CA. Music was not the typical main stream songs that you hear on the radio, which wasn't my favorite and the crowd consisted of older professionals. Definitely not a dress up type of lounge, everyone was dressed casually.~~#~0
This was a terrible experience.  You can not reach anyone via phone, you have to book online, which I did and also requested a phone call.  I rcvd no call and had an email in my email confirming a time for cleaning.  I requested a call then and got a reply stating someone would call me in 15 mins.  Still no call.  The cleaners arrived & I had someone let them in.  When I returned they were to clean the bathrooms & they were TERRIBLE TERRIBLE!  The sinks were dirty, with tooth paste splatters on sink, the inside of the shower had brown marks from some sort of un rinsed product.  I am so unhappy about this.  I have tried to reach them every day since & have not recieved a call back from a voice mail or email.  DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY THEY ARE AWEFUL!~~#~1
I had an amazing facial here! The space is clean, inviting and relaxing. Park in the lot south of the building, it is less crowded. After an hour of pampering my skin was glowing! They offer many of different services including laser treatments. I will be back for some more aggressive treatments to fix up my flaws (not that I have any)! Anyway, the staff is very professional. Before or after your treatment go next door for some great Thai food!~~#~1
Bliss, Delight, Contentment... words to describe our evening Monday night at Sens. I could go into a very fluffy review, but, with a nod to the simple zen-like restaurant, I will only address and highlight. ~Spa Like atmosphere - welcomed and enjoyed.~Attentive, but not aggressive server...great attitude! ~The Bar Menu I expect to see if I go to heaven. ~Homemade infused alcohol.. finally in Phoenix! ~Open kitchen, I was able to watch the chef CRAFT my meal. All items served "tapas" style... great opportunity to try many items! Food is prepared and served to allow the diner to choose the experience... either enjoy the food natural, or enhance with dipping sauces. These are not the heavy, sticky sauces of Pei Wei fame. ~Mango Spring roll.. light, fresh items in rice paper 2 rolls sliced ~Soup Gyoza, 4 little light dumplings filled with pork and a delicate broth..divine! ~Volcano Beef sear your own tender beef strips (5) on the hot stone, then wrap it up in a lettuce leaf with herbs and peanuts,... try a dip of the accompanying sauce...ecstasy, prepare to order 2 they're so good! ~Panko Shrimp - liken to little shrimp "hushpuppys".. very good, but not the highlight of the evening.. Mr Chu could improve upon these in my opinion. ~ Red Thai Curry - 4 unique, yummy curry / coconut milk dipped wings perched on a Asian "slaw" ~Spicy Wontons - Americans will love these.. familiar flavors, with wonderful dipping sauces. No-one in our party was disappointed... everyone was very pleased and anxious to return.  ** Personal Suggestion *** Have a food allergy ?? .. Use common sense when dining. Take personal responsibility and ask questions of your server BEFORE ordering.~~#~1
Picazzos is not very big and was filling up fast by the time we left. There is indoor seating, outdoor seating and a bar area. No exciting decor. Looks just like your standard Italian eatery.This place prides itself on  it's organic and local ingredients. Which is great, but the price definitely reflects this. According to our server, both the regular crust and marinara sauce are 100% dairy free, so I did a create-your-own pizzza with veggies and non-dairy cheese (I believe they use Daiya).The pizza was good, but not amazing. I like a lot of Daiya on my pizza, so when I go again I'll definitely ask for extra. Also, I ordered spinach on my pizza and I felt that the spinach wasn't fully cooked, just a little wilted. I like my spinach fully cooked because I feel that adds more flavor, but that's a personal preference.Our drinks took a while to come out, and for what we ended up paying we didn't get a heck of a lot. I'll definitely be coming back soon and see if I can't get them to veganize one of their specialty pizzas.~~#~0
Why review a fast food chain?  For me, this particular Sonic is close to where I work.  Because there aren't many options when pressed for  time I'm able to walk or drive here and grab a quick bite to eat.  Like most fast food chains it's about consistency, knowing what you're going to get and getting it quickly.  That's what this Sonic location does well.  Plus, who can pass up hot and crispy Tater Tots??3 stars because, on principle, I think that's the most any fast food place can reasonably expect.~~#~0
This is a great place to have a casual meal.  It's obviously a pub atmosphere but it's large enough to accommodate a lot of people without it getting crowded.  They also have many well placed flat screen tvs. (I just wish they would turn on the closed captioning!  Its one thing if you're watching a sporting event but when they have on an analysis show I want to hear the analysis!)   My husband had the beer sampler and enjoyed most of the varieties, the Raj IPA was his favorite (the 8th Street Ale and Kiltlifter are the more popular ones).  We had the soft pretzel appetizer which was ok, but I'm spoiled when it comes to pretzels having lived in Philly and lived on them for my entire college career.   I wish it came with a honey mustard to dip in and not just regular spicy mustard.  I had the French Dip which was solid - not the best I've had but still pretty good.  My husband had the Tap Room Tenderloin sandwich that he enjoyed - the onion straws and bleu cheese were a nice touch.Now this is just stupid.  (Saturday, 4/13) Ring ring ring. . ."Hello, Four Peaks""Hi, will you be showing the Red Sox/Yankees game?""Yes, definitely.""Even though it's being blacked out?""Blacked out?""Yeah, Fox won't be showing the game because the Diamondbacks game is on at the same time.

So the food at this place is good. Well the sliced turkey sud. But when it came to delivery and internet ordering. Oh my god the incompetence of these people. After and hour, 15 mins after the food was suppose to be delivered (the order was 2 turkey subs and garlic cheese bread.) I called and was told that there was no delivery guy and if i can come pick it up that they would knock off 25%. But the foods not ready yet, how long does it take to make 2 subs. So i pick up the goods and damned if i didn't check the bag they didn't give me the 2nd sub. Ugh they never checked the order. If you have online ordering  you need to follow though. So with a second phone call and a second trip to the place and 2 hrs after the original order i FINALLY get home and eat. The only good thing i got was a free lunch.  For that I give them a 1~~#~1
Cibo is a really adorable place, but I can't say that I think it is extraordinary.  The atmosphere and ambiance is totally five star, but too much goes wrong after that to give it an overall five star.  Food stuff:  I've been twice and both times I liked it, but it wasn't love.  We got the bruscetta plate and I wasn't really thrilled.  The traditional tomato one was the most solid choice, the bean one was strange and soggy and I don't eat pig so I can't comment on the third one (though everyone else seemed to enjoy it). The pizzas are pretty decent except that they lay out the toppings in a weird way, for example, if you order the vegetarian rosa pizza, if you like zucchini, it is all chopped up on two slices and so on.  It doesn't really make sense to top a pizza in such a way, to me.  I prefer draft beer over bottled beer, and all they offer is bottled.  I did enjoy a couple glasses of the Rossi Cabernet Sauvignon which was a solid wine choice.Service:  The host/ess was a pleasant person, and the time quoted was less than we actually had to wait so that rocked.  While waiting, we attempted to get a drink.  The bartender was cool about getting our drinks in a timely manner despite the fact that it was busy.  Our actual server was super attentive at first and then lost for a good chunk of time as well.  Too hit or miss.  Cibo is an adorable spot with awesome ambiance but it isn't quite that awesome when it comes to food and service.~~#~0
I love their beef sandwiches and thin crust pizza. It is just like being back in Chicago. Love it!~~#~1
The food is moderately priced and good, but the drinks are outrageously Scottsdale expensive.  I'll admit that they key lime martini was very delicious.  The Hell's Fire chips and Asian shrimp were perfect, and I would definitely recommend the food.  The lighting, more like a glow than a light, was quite awesome.  Service was pretty slow but professional.  The dj was great!  No one was wearing jeans, but there was a mixed crowd of some people in their 40's and many in their late 20's or early 30's.~~#~0
Zin, zin, zin - Yes, yes, yes!Several weeks ago five of us had a wonderful Monday evening at Zinburger with our delightful server, Candace. I arrived early, inquiring about the Left handed Polestar Pilsner, Candace offered a sample, very tasty - with three of my party eventually having it with dinner. We had a great booth - giving us a vantage point, watching the parade of customers & employees. I really like the airy, roomy, high energy vibe.With our drinks we had the delicious zucchini fires with two sauces ana subtle breading on the zucchini.We all tried different burgers, with some of us tasting each others, Candace made the split arrangements prior to serving us - nice touch. The meat is flavorful, melting in your mouth with a freshly baked bun.Fun, cool atmosphere & great food - made for a great get away, early in the week.My hats off to the Sam Fox team, another winner at ZinBurger.~~#~1
Visited the restaurant tonight and was very pleased.  I found the decor charming and elegant.  The atmosphere is amazing sans the hustle and bustle of most of the local chain like restaurants.  The place was devoid of the stereotypical Scottsdale element we prefer to avoid.  I found the prices easily justifiable in fact I though them quite reasonable.  We had the three onion tart appetizer, which was spectacular. For entrees we had salmon, filet, and a pair of lamb shanks.  Everything was wonderful.  The presentation was clean and the freshness and quality of the proteins, produce and accoutrement's was immediately evident.  Everything was cooked skillfully.  Had three of the four desserts on the menu.  The chocolate raspberry tart definitely stood out followed closely by the berry tart.  Delicately prepared and presented these were really an unexpected treat.  The environment is wonderful for Dining and chatting with people you actually like. The interior is intimate and it lends itself well to the cuisine.  I found the staff courteous, knowledgeable and professional.  We will be frequenting often and I encourage others to visit.~~#~1
This place is a hoot! A friend wanted to go to a movie that had been out for a while and it turned out that it was only still playing at this theater and one other. This is typically a $3 theater, we happened to go on a Tuesday and it turns out they have $2 Tuesday so it was even cheaper. You definitely get what you pay for...this theater has been around for a while but it's a great deal compared to the average movie gong cost. The concessions are also reasonable cost. Not the most comfortable seats in the world but you get what you pay for.The reason this place is a hoot? There are crazy decorations, life size figurines, games, etc, everywhere. I am sure I only really saw about a third of the decorations because it is just sensory overload. I hear they really deck it out at Christmas.So if you are looking for an affordable movie night and don't mind the seats from 20+ years ago this is a good option.~~#~0
This place has amazing pizza and great service. I've been 3 times and have not been disappointed. We've come for mostly group events such as bdays and going away parties, and you can do family style and share or get individual portions. Bruschetta and breadsticks are great starters, and I love the signature spinach pizza. Our waitress suggested getting it crispy to avoid getting soggy spinach and I'm glad I took the suggestion! Coworkers got Chicago style calzone with au jus and raved about it. Since there was a bday they comped a canoli and gave us an extra one for being cool :) pitchers are also half off on Thursday's so 7 bucks for 4+ glasses worth of fat tire made us all extremely happy!~~#~1
The staff of this "establishment" are some of the rudest, most condescending individuals I have ever met in my life. They will not give you ANY money, and you will have much better luck at Sunset Clothing Exchange, which is right up the street (Plus they actually have friendly staff). The people who are buying the clothes should not be buyers; judging from the way that they style themselves, they know nothing about fashion whatsoever. Everyone who has stated that you will not get any money from them for designer items is right... they would much rather have trite, "trendy" studded vests from Target than a pair of Miu Miu sunglasses.I was there about a year ago, and one of their young female employees was laughing, snarking and making faces at me. I had no idea who she was. It got to the point where my friend actually pulled her aside and said something. Today, their manager called me something that I can't even print on here. I had never seen him in my life, either. I have never done anything to these people except for sell my clothes to them.Avoid this place at all cost, they should change the name to Juggalo Exchange.~~#~1
Simply the best Ethiopian I've ever had.  Grew up in VA with DC as my stompin grounds (home of a large Ethiopian population) and even had a good amount of Ethiopian home-cooked meals by friends and none was as good as this place.  I go to AZ once a year for work and each time I am sure to stop in.  I usually get the veggie or meat-lovers meals since they tend to be such a good bargain, but have also ordered separate items as well.  The vibe is casual and the service is excellent.  The staff have always been very friendly --- another reason I keep going back.~~#~1
I'm somewhere in between three and four stars. And, I know there are Yelp "Talk" events taking place right this very second as I sit to type my review, and it is for this reason I appreciate what anonymity I have so I won't be egged as I walk out my door in the morning. And, it is possible that I expected something earth shattering within the vicinity of so much greatness (read: Pizzeria Bianco)First of all - I had to approach the bar for service, refills and a check. Granted there was one guy running the place at 3:30 in the afternoon, but my friends and I were three of five people at the entire property. They weren't busy. We sat out on the patio and watched all the folks across the walkway start to congregate outside Pizzeria Bianco in the rain. It was an unbelievable an hour and a half prior to opening, they have at least two seatings of Guests waiting in the rain - I swear there's got to be something addictive in that crust. I love Bianco, I do, but I am also (sometimes) very logical. Show up at 5 p.m., go find a great patio table at the Rose and Crown, or Bar Bianco and have some wine for a couple of hours prior to dinner - don't stand in the rain for an hour and a half!But, I digress...we're discussing the Rose and the Crown. Okay. Cute, compartmentalized rooms, yes. Homey feel, yes. Good selection of beer, yes. Good wine, no. Well made cocktails, yes. Menu, eh, okay. Service, eh, poor to okay.  Patio seats, rocking good! The trees changing colors, yellow leaves everywhere, perfect. People watching, phenomenal. Fish and Chips, pretty good. The friends I shared the experience with, too good to be true!~~#~0
Very run-of-the-mill, solid, nothing-exciting-or-surprising type of place. It's the kind of restaurant that's not your first choice, but when all your other options are closed, or too far, or too crowded, you come to Village Tavern and you end up not being disappointed.I was there today and had the $3 mimosas with the crab-cakes benedict. The potatoes that accompany the eggs are way too mealy, but the eggs themselves and the sauce are spot-on. Wished the crab-cake had a bit more flavor.Bread service is by request only, which I really like.Our hostess and our server were polite and efficient. Overall, a good place to bring mom and dad to on a lazy Sunday afternoon.~~#~0
Very impressed! $5 pitcher until 5pm, and excellent healthy food at a good value. Free valet parking.  I look forward to coming back.~~#~1
This is what I've come to expect from Waffle House. Great food with excellent customer service. My new home store since the one two blocks from my house is run by a cranky, sarcastic non-clean district manager (Kyle I was told is his name)~~#~1
The ever evolving menu changes again, But a coupon made it a decent buy.I will admit my co workers 2 for 1 coupon is why we went in. This means ~3.25 per burrito vs the usual $6 range.What I didn't like was that my vegetarian burrito did not have vegetables in it, it was just a bean and rice burrito with guacamole. I don't know how one gets the grilled veggies in their burrito but it is not by ordering a vegetarian burrito.The drink and napkin station here has always been a bottleneck, getting a refill or more napkins is nearly impossible.I do like the fact there there is Choula sauce in addition to the red and green tobascos. And I also like that the chairs are not nearly as bad as those at chipotle.The best tip this time is get in before 12, otherwise be prepared for a long long line.~~#~0
This place is absolute perfection.  From the setting to the service to the food, I loved every moment of it.  The only way I found out about this place was through Yelp.  You seriously are my trusty sidekick.  From the previous reviews I was a little worried that it might be packed, but then I remembered it was a Monday night so no worries.Walking in the restaurant, it is quite small, but just absolutely adorable.  It really does feel like an upscale country home.  Wood lines the whole restaurant and they have mini chandeliers hanging over every table.  Even the touches of place setting are just perfect.Our server was Gina and she was a complete sweetheart.  We started off with the Bohemian Sidecar and the Cucumber Vesper.  Both were absolutely delightful!  Then we moved on to appetizers, because while getting drunk is fun, I was really excited for the food.  We had the steak tartare and mussels in the saffron and white wine sauce.  I loved the steak tartare with the potato chips and fried egg on top.  Put fried egg on top of anything and I'm sold.  Put fried egg on top of raw steak and I'm in love!  The mussels came out just as we were finishing up the steak tartare, perfect timing!  The mussels were equally amazing if not more, and I am so sad that they only give one piece of bread!  Well that, along with the bread and butter.  But that still wasn't enough for me!  I wanted to soak up all of that saffron sauce goodness!After Gina cleared that out of our way, she brought out the glass of Bordeaux and Rhone blend.  I hate when I don't have a drink in front of me, and she made sure that never happened.  Then the entrees came.  The pork shoulder with the bacon for my bf, and the stuffed chicken with the pome puree and mushrooms for me.  Again, absolute perfection on both accounts!  I loved the mushrooms that were slightly charred and crispy, with the sauce and the puree and the chicken with goat cheese.  I'm getting hungry again just writing about it.  My bf loved his, but I still maintain that mine was better.  And both of these entrees were incredibly reasonably priced at $15 and $17.  Could life get any better?Well apparently it could!  After we polished off our entrees, then came dessert and after dinner drinks!  We had the souffle which was amazing with the creme anglaise.  And the berries with the creme fraiche.  Heaven in my mouth!  We finished that off with the chocolate martini and the pear tini.This review cannot do this place justice.  This is truly a unique experience that is far above any of the restaurants in Scottsdale.  Please go in and experience this for yourself, you will not be disappointed!~~#~1
Amazing work!My dentist referred me to this place just down the street from her.  I was super scared, as I always am at the dentist, but the staff made me feel very comfortable.  They treated me like a patient at the hospital.  They were my angel nurses.  When Dr Amin came in, the "nurse" was holding my hand and telling me when to breathe.  I was, of course, shaking like a leaf.  The Dr "popped" me three times in the cheek, and I was all numb.  When I say "popped", I mean it was an electric shock wave pop flowing through my face to my freaking eyeball that made me tear up a little.  (this was done by the needle of course going into my cheek)  It was the craziest feeling, but relieving at the same time.  I just breathed through it, and it helped.  After about a min, the Dr was working his magic.  In about 45 mins, he was all done, and I had like 4 canals.  And I didn't feel a thing!!  :)I was very pleased with the staff, Dr Amin, and the work they did.  I highly recommend this place if you need a root canal done.  Plus if you're a scardy cat like me, this place makes you feel comfortable.~~#~1
Just off University, but manages to feel like a little hide-away, and pulls off an enticing mellow atmosphere, suitable for intimate conversation.Fish Tacos and a Margarita again please! How many times before I can force myself to experiment?~~#~1
This place is cute, affordable, clean, and tasty. I would recommend this place for a quick lunch since the service is fairly quick and has a simple menu. Or you can bring your date here for a cute dinner date. The place is a fairly quiet place, and the lighting is very nice.~~#~0
This place is great! Just opened up on central just south of camelback on the west side of the road. ...AMAZING gelato and the coffee is just what I need! Family owned, really friendly staff, free wifi, flat screen tvs,....also just saw a flier for a monday movie night...I guess they are gonna have double features on mondays...even made a specialty drink for the night....sounds like fun!...cool little spot, dont hesitate to check this place out!~~#~1
Really?  Because it doesn't get any better than this.  For what it is and for what it's worth this place is truly unique.  A slight step up from a hole in the wall type of place, this quaint spot serves up good, tasty, and satisfying food hot from the kitchen.What is a pasty?A pasty's history can be associated with the tin miners in England.  The story goes that these miners were covered head to toe in dust and other nasty stuff and would eat these calzone like dishes as a means to have nourishment without the need to return to the surface.  Supposedly, the miners were able to eat the pastry like food by holding onto the "handles" and when done, discard the tainted remains into the mine thereby appeasing the spirits that haunted the mines.At the Cornish Pasty Co. I can first hand recommend the Chicken Pesto.  Very good flavoring and filling.  Or you can go with the more traditional route with beef, potatoes, and swede.  The sauces that come with your pasty are there to accent the flavors and are highly recommend to try as well.Pros* Good food* Originality* Portions* Customer service* Coat hooks at the barCons* Small interior~~#~1
Coming from a French family on my mom's side it is ingrained in my genes to love cooking, food, and shops like Sur La Table...oh and also wine and cheese...what a tough life I live!Sur La Table is a classy cooking shop which offers high end cooking ware, appliances, and also dishes. Somethings in the store can be pricey, but you can also find good deals as well. They offer many cooking things you wouldn't find at your average Crate and Barrel for more complicated cooking endeavors. I have also found some cute cookie cutters here for my mom's collection. The staff was all very helpful and knowledgeable. and many Sur La Table's now offer cooking classes!~~#~1
Why do people love this place?  MommaKat insisted on snacking here after a hard day of shopping, and I am not impressed.  AT ALL.I had to coerce the boy behind the counter to make a salad my way, not the normal recipe.  It was like pulling teeth.. no seriously, no cheese.  and I want this dressing not that dressing.  We stood in line for over 20 minutes at 4pm on a Saturday.  There were 2 couples in front of us.  LAME.There were no forks, and the cashier forgot to give me my brownie, and i thought he was going to have a conniption when I asked twice.Bathrooms were very nice and clean though.  Outdoor seating is very limited. Lame excuse for a panera-~~#~0
Today I went in for lunch and it seems the quality actually has gone down a bit it is still good pizza but the salad was a bit smaller and pizza just didn't have the same flavor.  You don't get that wood fired smoke taste which you would crave at a wood fired place.  I'll go back maybe today was a bad day as usually I like this place a lot.~~#~0
These guys have the tacos and nachos thing figured out. Great decor and hot, hot waitresses. We had lunch and it was pretty quiet. Good service. I'm sure things get crazy at night, though!~~#~1
Truly a hiden gem in Chandler. Located south of Chandler Boulevard, just off of Roosevelt (next to Archery HeadQuarters). Wanda's is a small yet quaint, twelve tables inside and 5 outside. Outside is for sure seasonal, as summers are too hot and dead of winter can be too cold. Wait times on a Sunday or Saturday can be 10-15 minutes during the "rush times", which is a quarter the wait time you would experiece at the near-by chains. The menu offers a variety to satisfy and hunger (except if you want lunch on weekends, it's breakfast all day, lunch from 11-2 during the week). The burritos are awesome. Ladies, I guarantee you will take half home! My husband likes the Biscuits and Gravy. The bacon is amazing and addicting often I have to smack my families hands away from grooping a piece. French toast, cinnamon raisin french toast and pancakes if you brought your sweet tooth =)   Build your omeltes are good too (tip, add a side of salsa, you won't be sorry, it is made fresh daily and goes perfect with a ham and cheese omelete). Service is exceptionally friendly, a lot of regulars and the servers know what you usually drink and sometimes can have your order written unless you throw a curve ball and veer from your usual. A+ Wanda!~~#~1
I have been coming here since discovering them after their opening week last year and I haven't stopped coming back. The food is predominantly Filipino; the Filipino-Mexican fusion comes in the burritos, flautas and quesadillas filled with Filipino meat dishes. A great starter would be the Chicken Adobo burrito. Karey's does it right by not dumping rice and fillings inside the burrito; they're served on the side. For those more interested in rice plates and combinations, Karey's serves daily prepared dishes such as Pork Adobo and Chicken Adobo (pork or chicken simmered in garlic and soy vinaigrette) and Beef Mechado (a type of stew with beef chunks, potatoes, and onions in a light tomato gravy) with either white rice or Garlic Fried Rice (yummy). There are also specials that rotate each day, which can be checked out on their Twitter account. This is a great idea as one can find out when they are serving Lechon (roasted pig)! Yum!There are dishes that can be prepared fresh but are not part of the combination specials.  The ones I've tried that I highly recommend are their Lumpia (fried eggrolls in chicken, beef, or vegetable) and Pancit Canton (stir-fried noodles with vegetables). The pork lumpia was great when they used to serve it, and I preferred it to the beef lumpia that they serve now...but it's still good ;)Not only is the food delicious but the warmth of the staff is something to always look forward to. Karen and Rey make you feel truly at home. The best thing about Karey's Kitchen is having a Filipino restaurant in Phoenix and not having to drive all the way to the East or West Valley!~~#~1
I love supporting such local businesses in my neighborhood- and you should too!  If I worked in the area, it would be in my lunch rotation.The customer service here rocks- it appears as if they actually care if you enjoy the food you have ordered.  I appreciate this and think they deserve a huge kudos on that one.  The hours are pretty ridiculous- they close at 5 on weekdays and are open from 10:30-3:30 on Saturday's.I've had the Route 66 (Buffalo chicken) and the Ringo Starr and have enjoyed them, but it wasn't true love.  Don't get me wrong, fair choices but no real excitement.  The Sirachi chili sauce helps out- but I love that stuff.A solid choice, although not mind blowing in any stretch of imagination.~~#~0
Sundae for Sunday.Pink spot helps me go through the summer heat.~~#~1
This place has a top notch tuna tataki app! Great rolls out quick regardless of how busy they are. Excellent service all the way around and very reasonable on price. Green tea ice cream for after dinner treat, I think so!!!! I forgot to mention I was in and out during lunch time spending 20 dollars.~~#~1
Earl's is Earl's - not great - not bad. If you're in the neighborhood and don't have anywhere else to go, go to Earl's. By far there are better choices, but Earl's will do when you're in a pinch.Typical bar food with no particular edge to make it memorable. The staff is very friendly and the service is very good. Just average, not memorable.~~#~0
Half the fun is the wait.....If you are going to go, you may as well get into it. We get into it, at their Italian place next door and drink tons of wine. L and I later that night had a hot kiss and she lost her precious earrings. I even drove back the next day to look for them somewhere against the wall. Just kissing, but hot, if you lose earrings.We went twice once alone, and the 2nd time with her sons and friends. We ordered every pizza imaginable. It seems almost every high end pizza now, is brick oven and more about the crust. I like everyone else will mention, I am from the East Coast and know pizza. Best in the United States, we have several that are at that level. You can flip a coin on which one is better.~~#~1
Love chickafila :) they're pretty pricey for fast food though~~#~1
Marcella's does have its downside, but today I'm in a good mood and I am recommending you stop in for the following three reasons:1.) They bring absolutely delicious bread (including olive oil) to your table almost immediately. I love this and I love their bread.2.) You can sit on a "patio" inside the mall and have the most amazing people-watching experience. Fashion Square shoppers can be quite entertaining.3.) The Amalfi Spritzer might just be my favorite cocktail of all time. Vodka + passion fruit + basil = HEAVEN. Plus, they use those cute little cylinder-shaped ice cubes that somehow make the drink even better.~~#~0
Let's face it, junk is the antithesis of glamorous.  When you've got a big pile of crap you need hauled away, any guy with a truck will do, right?WRONG.  You want someone that will be on time, is willing to clean up the area where the junk is after they've picked everything up, is polite and fluent in English, thinks of value-added services like emptying your trash bin, and represents a local business that you can patronize.Junk Guys ticked all these boxes for me.  THe guys were great and helped me out when I needed some items hauled away from a house that I had sold.  I'd highly recommend them over an unknown entity or a big corporate junk removal company.  So go get your crap hauled away by the Junk Guys - you'll thank me!~~#~1
Nello's is the best!  Great local feel, great food, love this place.You have to have:  (Gluten Free) Pizza, Garden Salad with Turkey and House Dressing.  It will soon be your go to feel good order.~~#~1
Wow, it must be a first-time mall experience for the reviewer before me.  Five stars for Arrowhead?  Are you kidding?I find this mall to be average and boring with many middle of the road stores (Dillards, Sears, Gap, Tilly's, Forever 21) you can find elsewhere at other Westcor malls in the Valley.   Nothing really strikes me as distinctive at this mall - other than the fact that it's the nicer of two indoor shopping malls on the Westside.  So for 500,000 people this is the only game in town unless they're willing to drive east.The store mix and food court are pretty typical.  In fact, I rarely go here unless I am in the area, need socks or undershirts and/or I'm trying to avoid the lines of the other Arrowhead Paradise Bakery.~~#~0
When I was recovering from surgery, I received of one of their arrangements. It was marvelous. The quality was unbeatable, with gorgeous blooms and fantastic presentation. They lasted for weeks. I am really pleased with this company and wouldn't hesitate to use them again!~~#~1
I remember when this place first opened.  I was very excited since it seemed so "humbling".I came here for lunch and thought this place actually looks "okay" at best.  Chicken Sandwich was excellent.  The bread was toasty and crunchy, while the Chicken and toppings were warm and buttery!  However, the soup can improve.  They only gave to you 2 options so I guess I had a 50/50 chance of getting the good one!  The place was loud and popping!  Not sure what to make of it since they had wine racks and wine, but then teeny hot pink tank tops hanging from the wines.  Is this supposed to make me want to drink more wine or should I buy a shirt for my GF?  Though I don't think anyone would appreciate a shirt that says PIE.  Service was good, I guess.  Our waiter was very nice and helpful, but he seemed flustered with a smile.  He didn't do anything wrong by any means except he was going about 100 more miles than I was.  - Enjoy~~#~0
I would just like to start off by saying that I love egg salad sandwiches. I have probably tried an egg salad sandwich anywhere that serves egg salad. Sacks is BY FAR, the BEST egg salad sandwich (entitled "The Dali") I have ever had in my life. I live in North Phoenix and I will literally drive many miles just to eat at Sacks. On top of the wonderful menu, whenever you order a sandwich from them, the meal comes with a little chocolate chip cookie, which is amazing all in itself. If you like their cookies, you can purchase the cookie dough. They also make other delicious dessert bars and salads that are for sale as well. I have been eating here for at least 14 years, and I hope they NEVER go away!~~#~1
I have found my new favorite sushi spot.I wish it was closer to Tempe, but it's worth the drive.You can tell by their menu that Hana strives to be an authentic Japanese restaurant, as opposed to the sake bomber joint that only has food so they can call themselves a restaurant. You know the kind; the Phoenix area is plagued with them. Hana is BYOB, and there are only a few ridiculous fusion rolls on their sushi menu: most of it is authentic, real sushi. On my first visit I started with my usual appetizers, and was immediately struck by how unusually fresh and tasty they were. The seaweed salad had just the right amount of sesame oil, giving it incredible flavor. The veggie gyoza were indescribably delicious. They made me realize I'd never had a fresh gyoza before; every one I'd eaten previously in my life was a pale imitation of these little bits of Heaven.The sushi came out fast, even though it was fairly busy this particular Thursday. The first thing I noticed, naturally, was that someone put a burning sugar cube on the tray. "Hey, fire!" I thought. It was a nice touch.Then I saw, nestled between the flaming sugar and the wad of wasabe, a small pile of what looked like pickle relish. I guessed what it was, and our waitress confirmed it: it was FRESH wasabe.Real, fresh-grated wasabe is something most people never experience. Most people don't even know the pasty green stuff that's standard in every sushi restaurant is just normal horseradish dyed green. The real stuff is just too expensive, and too difficult to keep on hand. But there it was, no extra charge. It adds a little spice and a wonderful, fruity complexity to the sushi. The sushi was great. They also have a large menu with all the other Japanese dishes you'd expect, but I didn't try any of them. Next time.~~#~1
Well...no worries for the continued bad service...awful prices...average inventory....and just overall bad experience....because the store closes forever this weekend. I have never cared for the place....so I definitely won't miss it. However if your looking for some decent electronic gear at 60-80% off....then this is your weekend to go. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends~~#~1
This little taco shop gets 5+ stars! The fish tacos were out of this world, breaded and fried to perfection. I also tried the al pastor taco that was marinated well and you can taste the marinade in every bite. I also tried molotes for the first time. The cilantro salsa and red salsa was homemade and oh so good and spicy. The quesadillas are like cheese crisps. I am so disappointed that I did not find this place earlier since it's so close to home. I have to try the other items in their menu soon. Price is very reasonable as their tacos range from $1-$1.50.~~#~1
I love a greasy burger joint so I wanted to try Smashburger.  I took my order to go.  The layout of the store is different than most burger place...a rather minimalist front counter.  The service was quick, and I received my food in a reasonble amount of time.  It was hot and fresh.  I ordered the 1/3 Smashburger with everything and Smashfries.  The burger was ok.  It was spiced in the same way that Hamburger Works or the Chuckhouse does their burgers.   The veggies on the burger were fresh.  The bun started to fall apart about the time I finished the burger.  overall...it was just ok.  It ain't no Lenny Burger.  I'd rather go to Fatburger then Smashburger.  The fries were crispy and flavored.  They were good.  When I first saw them I thought the portion was rather small, but when I took it out of the box in which they came, it appeared to be a normal portion.I won't avoid the place if people want to go there...but I won't make a special trip.~~#~0
I like to think of Trader Joe's as a "specialty food/health market." It is simply in a league of its own when compared to large commercial grocery chains. Honestly, there is no comparison! With that being said, this is the BEST Trader Joe's I have been too! (and I have shopped quite a few in my travels across the US) The sheer size of this store, in TJ standards, is IMPRESSIVE!  The isles are plenty large enough for TWO people (with carts) to maneuver through.  And more importantly EVERYTHING looks fresh and delectable!  Some of my fav's are: $3.99 Trader Joe's Coastal Cab...FABULOUS for the price! (Quite honestly though, I haven't EVER had a bad wine at Traders...they have an amazing selection that isn't overwhelming but isn't sparse either.) I also LOVE that they CLEARLY label each of the wines and/or regions so they are quick and easy to find! The Haircot Verts (French Green Beans) are simply delicious! Their Brussel Sprouts are the perfect size and quantity; just enough for two people at two different meals.  They even have Nulaid "Ready Egg" (i.e. egg beaters) for $3.69! At the grocery store the SAME stuff will cost you TWICE that!! Their cheese selection is delightful with almost ANY kind of cheese imaginable! Their artesian breads are so yummy...although not a "low fat/fat free" food, so that is a once every few months splurge. (and even then we only get the small loaf (which I want to say is called a "little bastard." That name CRACKS me up!) And although I am not a "sweet" eater, my hubs is...so he has a dozen or so goodies that he constantly gets here. The one I can think of off the top of my head are their Chocolate Covered Joe Joe's with Peppermint Crumble (or something like that.) I'd go look at the box but we are fresh out because the hubs thinks that eating one box over a two-three day period is acceptable! It also fun to be rewarded for bringing your own reusable bags; as any good eco-friendly shopper would do! There is a weekly drawing for a TJ's gift card (I think the value is $25) and you get a ticket when you bring your own bags. (not one for each bag...just one ticket for bringing them to put your goodies in) Then they draw a name out of all the tickets (which you drop in a box on your way out of the store) once a week.  If you shop more than once a week, you can "earn" a ticket for each time you shop there in a week therefore increasing your chances of winning. (although I am PRETTY sure the majority of Surprise/Sun City Grand shop there so maybe the odds aren't THAT great! )Regardless, this is just a great little "market" through and through. I used to get excited to shop at TJ's...now I am always looking for an excuse to buy something just so I can go there! (and it's not just to try and win the gift card either..that's an added bonus!)~~#~1
Great Brisket. There has not been good BBQ in south Scottsdale for a long time. There is now!. The food is wonderful and priced well. Stop in and grab a bite.~~#~1
I had initially checked this place out a couple of months ago.  Once again we found ourselves needing some quick, delicious breakfast and decided to try this place out again.  As before it was absolutely delicious.  The one thing that surprised me this time around however was the little play area toward the back of the restaurant.  This is very impressive to me as it gave us some much needed peace prior to getting our food.  Thank you Bertha's Cafe for not only being so accommodating, but also for having such wonderful food.~~#~1
Feeling a bit weary from a steady stream of travel, we decided to head over here for my favorite Rx, Pho.A couple of summer rolls filled with shrimp, pork and vermicelli, dipped in the sweet peanutty sauce, a dash of their house hot sauce(a tad more fire than the "cock" sauce) and we were off to  a fine start. I was feeling better already.The Pho arrived, and the aromas were simply intoxicating. After a short interlude of vaporized euphoria, we dug in, adding the usual lime, cilantro, basil, sprouts and aforementioned hot sauce. Commence slurping.The broth was simple yet complex in layered flavors. Noodles were perfect in abundance and texture. My companion chose beef and shrimp and declared they were cooked perfectly. I selected the special beef which included shank, brisket, tendon, tripe and meatball. Outstanding.Service was with a smile, prompt and attentive. I honestly felt like I was sitting in someone's home enjoying what they might eat on a daily basis. I do not think that Cyclo can compare, while good, this just seemed more authentic.~~#~1
Owner Daniel M. is one of my most favorite restaurateurs in Phoenix. His stamina and passion for the business of serving fine cuisine is a rare find. Daniel is from South America but you wouldn't know it; his knowledge of the secret kitchens of Tuscany, Umbria and Amalfi is uncanny. I know this because I traveled with him and his chef one year on their odyssey through Italy.Daniel takes special pride in personally choosing a very select few bottles of wine to fit any budget. OK, it's not Etienne's Different Point of View's list of 4000, but know that any choice you make is going to be a good one. If you're not sure, just ask for Daniel and tell him what you have in mind -- likely he has (with a wink) a special bottle in the back.When we traveled through the Italian countryside I was constantly astonished by the warm greetings and special invitations we had from local proprietors who shared with us exquisite homemade wines and dishes made with pride from the finest vegetables and livestock. We frequently stayed long past closing with the owners and into the night sampling rare port and grappa. At one restaurant in Orvieto the owner took us deep into the dank recesses of the wine cellar for a special sampling  of cheese and wine. Talk about knowing people? One afternoon while drinking our 5th bottle of wine, who walks by but Jan D'Atri! Wow. (That's another review.) And speaking of reviewers, I also ran into Phoenix Magazine's Nikki Buchanan (also extremely nice).When Daniel first opened in this location with that little stone oven in the corner, it was a pizzeria and guests could belly up to long tables in a casual environment that was made easy by his banter with the heavy Italian accented waitress (name?) who made a comeback some years later. For quite some time the restaurant was Il Forno; that is until corporate giant Il Fornaio entered the fray and sued him to change the name. After much rigmarole he changed to aqua e sale -- and notice Il Fornaio has since closed its doors? LOL. Again after much hoopla, he made it Daniel's. The current wood-paneled decor makes me think of a city club in San Fran or London. Very posh, yet understated. Selections of sculpture and art from his travels dot the restaurant's three small dining rooms.The menu is a very difficult one. I say that because it has all of your favorites and it is difficult to make your final selection. Great for steak, ravioli, the best carpaccio in the city, best buffala mozzarella, mmm.... I could go on and on. So does the menu, page after page.Some might call the preparations simplistic. This is the Tuscan way. Simple ingredients and simple preparation. Let the ingredients make their own magic. Grilled rack of lamb is not drowned in some Smucker's lime jelly, but gently brushed with rosemary and garlic, tickled with salt and pepper and finished with a squeeze spray of lemon.Unfortunately the artful one-of-a-kind plates and bowls handmade in Vietri chipped at the edges over the years and the health department made him throw them away -- UGH!! -- they were a beautiful motivation to make you lick your plate clean to see the painted pictures beneath your scrumptious dinner. Not that you needed an excuse to dab every last bit of sauce with the wonderful mini loaves of bread cooked right there in the hearth that started it all.Daniel himself is a wonderful host. He loves to give his guests a wonderful experience. There are many choices for Italian food in Phoenix. Most of it is just American Italian. Daniel's is a unique touch of the simple yet elegant. Enjoy.P.S. [post edit] OMG. How could I forget the Tiramisu? It's a generous portion, so you can share with your guest, but after your first bite you may not want to. Light and airy, yet fantastically flavorful, the quality of the coffee really makes this dish a reason to go back again and again. I'm not going to tell you the secret ingredient. You'll have to ask Daniel.~~#~1
This place it hit or miss for me. I have always ordered the feta gyro and either fries or a small Greek salad. Why is the soda machine always broken? Makes me wonder what else is broken and not fixed in the kitchen. I ate here for the 5th or 6th time on Thursday. The gyro is excellent, but the fries were overcooked and the oil didn't seem very fresh, as the fries had a brownish, oil soaked feel. I will return for the gyro, but I may skip the fries and stick to the salad.~~#~0
Changing Hands is the perfect bookstore. These types of places just don't seem to exist, but Changing Hands has managed to survive.Allow me to begin by saying that this bookstore does not have anywhere near the selection of a Barnes and Noble (or probably a Borders, but I don't go into that garbage store and cannot be sure). With that said, there are a few reasons to shop here.First, and most importantly, they have well priced used books. I believe most of their used books are $7.50. They are also all in pristine condition. Now, $7.50 used isn't always that great for a paperback. You can do better online quite often. What's notable, however, is that their hardcovers are typically $7.50 as well. This is a fantastic price and is hard to beat.Second, the location of CH is perfect. This is one of the best plazas out there. Wildflower, Trader Joe's, Mac's, Jamba Juice--you can't go wrong.Third, and finally, Changing Hands is a local store, and many good things come with that. The staff is extremely friendly. From what I can tell, they are all hardcore book nerds and you have to love that. The store also has a very welcoming feel to it. Once you're in, you will realize how extremely friendly everyone is. No, not just the staff--the customers. Everyone is talkative, friendly, and just seems to be happy. They are all indulging in one of their hobbies in one of the most inviting stores I have ever seen. Someone will ask the staff "who wrote such and such?". The staff will almost assuredly spot a regular and ask him or her  "who wrote such and such". If he doesn't know, someone else will  probably pipe up. It's this type of thing that makes it a great store. Overall, it just has a great atmosphere.The only negative comment I can make about Changing Hands is how hippy it is. There's a ton of books on spiritual techniques, new age methods, buddhism, and whatever the hell else hippies/hipsters think makes them look more cultured. Of course, this just goes along with the Tempe, Trader Joe's, and book reading demographic, so I can't blame them for meeting the inherent demand.~~#~1
So, if I rated The Grind based solely on the Sweet and Spicy Burger, I would give it a  Woohoo, five star rating, but, I'm not , just thought you should know, you need to get that burger if you come here.I was a little surprised to see how small this restaurant is when my mom and I decided to come here for lunch (she was wanting burgers). This place reminds me of a narrow cave that happens to have a long bar with about 18 stools, six larger booths that can fit five patrons comfortably, four table tops, and three double occupancy booths. The bar is pretty cool, its lined with red lights and has eight rather large flat screen TVs you can see from the stools and the larger booths that we were seated at. I opted for the Sweet and Spicy burger ($12), thanks to Yelp, and my mom went with a plain ole cheeseburger ($11). Knowing that the burgers do not come with anything, we decided to order the sweet potato fries ($5) and both got iced teas ($2.5 each). My burger was delicious and was everything the title said it would be...sweet and spicy thanks to the sweet glazed jalapenos. I also enjoyed the crunchy, deep fried ratatouille, yum. My mom wasn't impressed with her simple cheeseburger and said she would order mine if she were to come back and we both enjoyed sharing the sweet potato fries.Brent, our server, did a great job with suggestions and service. As lunch time got more busy and he got more tables he was always checking in with us and even put our iced teas in to-go cups. This place was, as the default Yelp display states, a-ok.  I'm glad I tried The Grind, but probably wouldn't suggest this place for lunch, but wouldn't hesitate to come back here if it is suggested by friends.Breakdown:one star for being a narrow caveone star for the Sweet and Spicy Burger   -and-one star for Brent, our awesome waiter.~~#~0
I used to work here so it had to be good;) Honestly, I would say it is the most friendly place I had been to. Cashiers are willing to except all coupons and work with their customers. The prices are great and the gas rewards system is very useful. I just wish it was a Marketplace instead.~~#~1
I have been to a buffet like this before, but I will never go to this particular one again. The food all looked fresh as we went through the food line selecting our favorites and stacking our bowl to the sky. We selected our sauces and turned it over to the grill. The cook doused our dishes with water, quickly cooked the ingredients, and returned them in a new bowl. There is a selection of crispy wonton bits, rice and soups for you to add to your tray at no cost. I selected no rice as they were all old and burnt to the pan. I chose the hot and sour soup because it is ma favorite. Free-range and refills on beverages. Sat down to eat, was not impressed. I could not muster to try a second spoon of the soup as it was absolutely disgusting. The bowl of ingredients were all bland, perhaps from the overuse of water at grilling, and I am almost certain the tofu had gone bad, The slivers of meat that my husband had selected tasted fowl as well. We obviously did not get to far into our meal before leaving. Had we not already paid there would have been several complaints from me, and changes in selections. We could have taken the left overs home, but opted to leave them instead. Suffice to say, I do NOT recommend.~~#~1
Walking in was like seeing a rainbow for the first time. UH-mazing! Every type of candy ever created and more candies that you've never even heard of. Best part about it was that it was super affordable. It was like a mini-costco of just candy. I ended up going twice on Saturday. Love it!~~#~1
We were going to movies when the skies opened up.  That is when we first noticed we needed new windshield wiper blades.Kinda dumb, right?  But, the only time we use them here in the Valley is after a car wash?  Think about it.  So we stopped at this location on Northsight, next to former site of "Al's Beef" which is now closed.  The folks who work there stopped me as I walked in and asked for the make and model of my car.  Within ten seconds we were over to the aisle and had the correct blades for our car.  WOW!  What a great group!A funny aside.  As we left, I started taking out one of the blades and began throwing away the plastic and cardboard in the outside trash bin.  Another shocker.  It was filled to capacity with old blades.  Great minds, Eh?~~#~0
Seriously?! With grocery stores like Fresh & Easy, Trader Joe's, and even Safeway around here, I wouldn't go to Whole Foods regularly, for ANYTHING, unless I was a bajillionaire. 1. It's wayyyy overpriced. I'm not sure if there's a Central Market around here as haven't seen one yet, but even that is better than this in terms of price! We got a few items here, specialty items in bulk foods, for example. The wine and beer bar is cool, but unlike the Whole Foods in Austin, Tx, which was the epitome of awesome, (2) one can't walk around with beverage in hand here. Too bad the rules are so stringent about that, because if I were shopping with a glass of wine, maybe I wouldn't notice the horrendous prices quite so much.My 3rd complaint is that when we ordered coffees from the coffee stand there, my mocha and my boyfriend's latte tasted like motor oil, after taking forever to be made, and the girl saw me swipe my card but THEN told me she "didn't have a register person" and I wasn't able to cancel the transaction....so then we had to go back through the main grocery line again. Grrr.  I left unsatisfied, uncaffeinated, and feeling like I had just wasted ten bucks on coffee that we ended up pouring out. They get one star for having a wine/beer bar at all, but then I have to take that star away because the bar tender said they sold the most beer and wine of any Whole Foods in existence (I call bs - the one in Austin is twelve times busier and people can shop with their beverage of choice, and they have a bunch of restaurants there too so it's truly an experience - it dazzles). This leaves one star for the supply of bulk and specialty items they carry. We went to Trader Joe's after, got twice as much stuff, and spent half as much money. Sayin'.~~#~1
I love Coach.Stylish and trendy without spending an obscene amount of money on a bag. Sure they are still a bit more pricey than a purse at Target, but you are paying for name. The sales associates are really nice and won't hesitate talking to you. I only have a few things from Coach because usually I can't justify spending to much money to accessories, but anything you buy here you can use forever. A coach bag will probably never go out of style.~~#~1
Amazing place for exceptionally good beer and time with friends! Minimal menu but great collaboration with other local vendors and ordering for delivery at their location is encouraged! Their beer recently passed Four Peaks as my favorite too, not an easy feat! If you're on the fence at all about checking this place out, do yourself a favor and just get yourself there!~~#~1
Humdinger!  What more is there to say.  It's the best sandwich ever.  It tastes even better on the weekends when Kids Eat FREE!  If you have a larger family ( more than 2 kids ), this is the best deli in town.~~#~1
mid-afternoon is definitely different than dinner. still tasted good.we usually get the layered dip, it's totally messy and not as good as i think it should be, but i like it anyhow.i get the durango burro and matt gets some combo monstrosity.service is...meh, average. queso is tasty.~~#~0
I was initially going to give Riva's 3-stars, as they're really just like any other Filiberto's/Umberto's/Roberto's/Ernie and Berto's out there, except for a couple of small differences.For one, everything seems to be just a little bit more fresh there.  It's probably not, but it tastes like it.  And secondly, their little salsa bar is killer because their green salsa has plenty of flavor and they always have fresh pico de gallo out there, a must for any burrito.The California Burrito, with carne asada, potatoes, pico de gallo and cheese, is a must, as is the standard Carne Asada Burrito.  But the real winner here is the Carne Asada Fries.  A metric ton of carne asada piled on top of freshly fried french fries, sour cream, cheese and guacamole for only $5?  Can't be beat, especially if you're hammered and it's 3 A.M. Not a classy joint, not a place you go if you're wary of stupid crap like "health code violations" (the best places never are), but definitely a late-night hot-spot for the Mill crowd.  Lovely.And it's not for sissies that don't like ham in their beans either, damnit.~~#~1
He's been the top vote-getting General Dentist in Phoenix Magazine for three years in a row for a REASON, folks. He has an office in Chandler and in Mesa but even if you live in Minnesota, he's worth the drive.~~#~1
I have long been a fan of AJ's and lucky for me, they didn't open a location on the West Side of town until after I moved back to California. If they had, I would have been more broke then I was as a single working mother.The daughter and I stopped in before her hair appointment for some coffee and pastries and then I came back in once her hair was getting done. The first thing I did was order some iced tea from their coffee counter. It was absolutely delicious iced tea and very reasonably priced. I want that tea now, I think it was pineapple or something yummy. I perused around the store, picking up some Goldwater Salsa and a stuffed Cornish game hen to cook later in the day for my Grandma from the butcher counter. I was thrilled that they still had the stuffed fresh hens for the same price I used to pay $4.99. Something inflation hadn't touched.I also picked up some huge honey crisp apples (something again Grandma can afford but won't buy for herself) and a small bunch of flowers for her. Next time I am in town, I am going to hit up AJ's right away for some iced tea!~~#~1
I went in once looking for Canidae.  Which according to their website bold print they carry, but not the fine print.  They don't carry it in all of their stores.  My dog has food allergies so I'm cautious about changing her food quickly but since it was about 7 pm and I was pretty much out of food on this day, I figured some food would be better than no food.  During my visit I learned many things.  Apparently Canidae is a inferior brand and ripped off its ingredients and packaging from Innova.  Innova is a far, far superior dog food.  Innova is awesome, Canidae is for chumps.  Innova is also more expensive and a smaller bag.  Nothing I couldn't afford but annoying none the less. Not wanting to create dog food controversy I bought a bag of the morally superior Innova.But when I checked out I was asked about four times whether I realized I was buying nibbles instead of bits.  "You know you have the nibbles. Are you sure you want nibbles?  We have bits if your dog prefers bits".She's a 70-lb lab that will eat anything except for vegetables.  I mentioned that the nibbles were fine."Are you sure you want nibbles?  We have bits if you want bits"?Dude, just ring up the freaking food and get me the hell out of here.  As expected, my dog ate the nibbles.  She felt superior for the month supply of Innova that she ate.  Then she went back to the ghetto and ate her  inferior Canidae.~~#~1
I love this place!  it's a cultural experience!  I think even if you are Mexican, this place delights all the senses!I love the tortilla department!  36 freshly made yellow corn tortillas for $2.50!!! the ladies at the meat dept were fantastic!The wall of spices, herbs, and chilis was incredible.I did not have enough time to sit and eat there but that's the plan for the next trip.I came home and made shredded beef tacos with all the fixings.My rec is come and linger and enjoy the sights and then have a great lunch either at the food court or at the restaurant next door.~~#~1
Not super impressed. The food was just ok. My friends said the French toast was good, but my Goat cheese, tomato and mushroom omelette had maybe had an oz. of goat cheese. At 9$ it was a rip off. The potatoes were good,but nothing special. The mimosa was excellent, but made from Andre, so after consuming it I had a headache. The service was slow, but they were good about refilling my coffee and water. Just an ok experience.~~#~0
*** I gave this 5 stars based on the best Mexican food I've had in AZ, not based on white linen and waiter service, just an fyi***I won't write too much as it seems that everyone already has. Both locations are GREAT. Some of the best "homestyle" Mexican I've ever had. I usually get the double wrapped enchilada combo that is pure saucy heaven! A great place to call ahead on a friday night when you're exhausted from work and not doing jack, pick up your food, pick up a six pack of Pacifico and head on home. Happiness is a sure bet!~~#~1
I was very disappointed in my encounter with them today.  I have been going there for years and thought they have done a good job.  Today I picked up my Tori Burch purse that I brought in to have a shoulder strap repaired.  The thread they used for the repair was a light cream color.  The purse and the stitching is a mustard yellow color.  It looks terrible!!!  They tried putting some cream colored shoe polish on the tread, no improvement.  Now the thread just looked dirty.  I told them that I was not at all happy with the repair.  They just kept saying in thick accent.  "It's good, I fixed it good".  They would not refund the amount I prepaid,  (prepay only store), or redo it with the correct color thread.  Just kept saying.  "I fixed it good".  Looks like I'll be finding a new shoe repair place.~~#~1
pretentious and bad service - attendants are totally clueless (though I feel for them if management makes them wear the costumes they wear). overpriced fashion brands.  if you want to spend $200 on a flannel, there are MUCH better options out there.  run in and glance at the sale rack, otherwise avoid this place like the plague.~~#~1
I play squash racquet's, a sport favored by the east coast "elites" from them Ivy League schools, those snooty Britishers and the Pakistani leisure class:) Why they let me play, I'll never know:)Last evening, we had a little tourney in which a group of us from the Village traveled to the outer reaches of Tempe to play a group from Lifetime Fitness:)It was a jolly good, show, ever so much fun and our Village group gave the Lifetime group a bit of a "Rodgering":)So it was with happy hearts and high spirits that we headed down the street to the post tourney repast at Skip & Jan's...let me start by saying that the Lifetime group picked this place, and it's almost like they knew they were going to lose and wanted to select a venue that would be the grimiest, greasiest, grubbiest, grossest spot to try to eat...they succeeded:)Where to start...I know...the parking lot:)When we arrived, the total Kelly Blue Book value of the 50-60 cars in the parking lot was about $832...we raised that by several orders of magnitude, just by driving in...this parking lot hasn't seen a lot of traffic from the Mercedes/BMW/Lexus/Jaguar crowd (and may never again:)After I safely parked a block or 2 away, I went inside and took in the look and feel of S&J...crappy old wood paneling...tables and chairs from a circa 1955 high school cafeteria...an intriguing mix of flat panel TV's, regular TV's and OTB results screens (yeah, you can bet the ponies here...the sport of Kings, in a slightly less than "regal" atmosphere:)They must have 20-25 pool tables...faded felt...and a whole bunch of people playing pool (and frankly looking like they weren't enjoying themselves...extremely tight and serious expressions on the faces of the people playing and watching...aren't games supposed to be fun? :-)...I suspect there was gambling going on:)The smell in S&J can only be described as "extreme humanity"...the place smelled like it has seen a century's worth of spilled beer, cigarette smoke, BO, vomit, urine, spoiled food and every other aroma that humans create for themselves...remarkable, given the fact that this place can't have been here for more than a few years...how did they do that so quickly? :-)S&J has menus, they have some sort of kitchen, they have Jagermeister on "tap", they have a bunch of beers on tap and they had a buffet (or "boofay" for my friend Ryan C) set up for our group.It was supposed to be a Taco Bar:)S&J provided a table full of taco "fixin's"...the centerpiece of which was the taco meat hot tray...Holy Crap, was that disgusting! :-(They told us it was ground beef, but I know my beef, and I don't think this was it...this was ground "creature"...possibly some sort of unfortunate non-distinct animal which happened to be near the kitchen when duty called.I kid, of course...as far as I know, this was indeed, "beef"...just not very good "beef":(The hot tray holding the "meat" looked like a relief map of the Hawaiian Islands...small mountains of "meat" rising out of the ocean of brown/orange grease that was the real body of the dish:(But, I was starving (a banana for breakfast and nothing else) so I tried to make a taco.I decided to forgo the slotted spoon that everyone was trying to use to fish some meat out of the soupy brine, and use some tongs instead...my idea was to try to squeeze as much grease out of the concoction as possible...I was sort of successful, but in doing so, I probably squeezed any flavor out as well:(I got back to the table and tried a bite...not good...I added several shakes of Cholla and tried another bite...and that was that:(One of my buddies had decided to forgo the mystery meat tacos and ordered wings from the menu and offered me one...I'm not sure what the deal with the wings was, but the wing I tried seemed to be boiled (no, not "broiled"...boiled) and then dipped in buffalo sauce...not crispy, just wet...all the way through:)Then they announced that Karaoke was going to start soon...and that was enough for me:(Adding amateur singing to this tableau would have just been too much:)Still, it's not all bad news...the tires and wheels were still on my car when I was ready to leave...I didn't become immediately ill (although I had kind of a rough morning, this morning).They say shared adversity can make teams grow together, so I think I should thank S&J for making the Village Squash group nearly invincible:)~~#~1

The "Cheers" of central Phoenix.~~#~1
I think I went the wrong way, but I ended up doing a very isolated trail that wasn't too scenic, but at least it was quiet.  It sort of just "ended" though and didn't wrap around.  So then I walked the same way back which was kind of boring.  I like trails that are on loops.~~#~0
We just sold the car we bought at Carmax that spawned the original review here almost three years ago.As with the purchase, the sale was ridiculously simple. The appraisal took about 20 minutes, and came in ABOVE Kelley Blue Book "excellent condition" trade in value -- and the car was in good - very good condition, but certainly not excellent.A fair price, and no hassle. At a car dealership. Who'd have thunk it?~~#~1
Welcome to Downtown!  Finally a little area with a few great chains.  They also have PARKING!  The parking is located on the east or south side of the building.  We grabbed Jersey Mike's on a Sunday afternoon and took it home to eat.  They are the best subs we have had.  They are packed with meat and cheese.  Might be little pricier then blimpie, but with it due to the over load of meat! Check out a Jersey Mike's near you!~~#~1
Ok, these guys get five stars from me for many reasons.  Before my visit today my other experience with them was for my wedding cake.  They were very courteous and helpful, although I ended up going with a cheaper option.  Today, however, they definitely earned five stars.I was there for a meetup event.  We got a tour of their facilities.  The owner personally did the tour, and did a great job considering I brought my toddler, who screamed through about 75% of the tour.  At the end, he gave us a cookie and thanked us for coming.  I know that some people think toddlers should be locked away so as not to annoy the general populous, but it's nice to know not everyone feels that way :)~~#~1
Decent Chinese food. I go often for take out. It is easy and convenient for those in central phoenix. I have had times where some of the food is great and other times it was bad. Support local restaurants, this beats panda express!~~#~0
Pure Bliss - I haven't had a quality meal experience like this in a very very long time.  The full 4 course dinner was stupendous and well worth every cent. You MUST try the Yin & Yang Martini!  It was  a very creative and well presented drink  that had me all smiles.  I had the Smores & Chocolate desert and it was hands down my favorite (I've tried at least 5 others).~~#~1
Come on now, let's call a turd a turd on this one.. Waterfront is a stretch, its a canal, a stinking fucking canal.. leave it to the Scottsdale developers and planners to put a Scottsdalian slant on the turd.. kudo's to them! However, with its chain stores and restaurants on one side and pretty lame so far on the other (Southbridge) this has become quite a giant and over priced turd. Those skinny Scottsdale bitches that hang out at Pink Taco, words of advice.. Fucking eat something!~~#~1
This is the best Seafood restaurant I have ever eaten in. I have to say it is not my kind of place. Very Scottsdale. But Man they know how to cook. I had a Special Shrimp dish of the night that was much better than expected and a very nice portion. The Calamari was 1000 times better than any other I have had. I am not a big fan usually, but this was different. It was not fried but pan cooked and even people that didn't like Seafood tried it and loved it. The Wedge Salad was good. We shared the Mac & Cheese, Mashed Potatoes and Peas. I felt the sides were the only things that could stand some improvement. I had one of the tasty Mojitos and some Yummy Creme Brulee for desert. I am super glad this place is far away because I would want to go all the time. It is a bit pricy, but I felt it was worth it. The servers were really cool. Not uptight at all. The only thing I hated was they have rest room attendants. Maybe it is just me, but come on. I should not have to feel guilty for not tipping someone just for handing me a towel that I could have easily gotten for my self. I have little respect for businesses that do that.~~#~1
Hands down, the single worst public mass transit system I have seen ANY PLACE I have ever lived or traveled to (and I am an avid world traveler). I've been riding this system on and off (I vaccilate between non-Phoenix-metro cities and here a lot) for roughly 10 years, and yeah, for a few of those years I would also drive a car here and there, so I have a sound basis of comparison. This is a joke compared to other cities in the USA (and abroad) that have equivalent populations. Hell, in NYC and LA, it's SOOO much easier to get around even though those places are larger and more densely populated. Phoenix is easily 30 years behind every other city-size comparable mass transit system that's out there. Get with the times!We need: busses that run MORE than once per 1/2 hour (and that's at it's current fastest), busses that are ON TIME (DAILY, they are never on time. Always way too early without waiting, or way too late without apology), more stops, stops that have actual BENCHES or SHADE or POSTED INFORMATION of any kind. I cannot even imagine how travelers get around on this thing, nothing is ever posted with any relevant info or signage.Etc, etc, etc.But seriously, just god awful and a complete joke to anyone who has ever experienced public transport anywhere else.~~#~1
Had a great experience. DId not feel gouged or pressured and our dog got the proper treatment for dehydration.  Friendly staff. Prompt service. Special attention from Dr. Heinritz appreciated. Very professional.~~#~1
awesome iconic eatery! whenever i visit az i make it a point to stop off at this ultra friendly, fantastic tasting joint. yeah, it takes a while to figure out the ordering process, but the staff is super helpful, and after the first or second time, one can figure out the system. it's just that everything is abbreviated which requires some thought. i usually mix 2 entrees to get different flavors. love the jerk chicken and fiery pollo diablo.although they are known for their snicker doodles, my dessert is usually ordering another entree to take home for later! hands down one of my favorite eateries. i wish we had one in minneapolis, mn...i would probably eat there daily for lunch, ha!~~#~1
So.... our teenage daughter ran out of toilet paper.No problem, right?  I'll just use paper towels... for 2 days.Yeah, it was a mess and Roto Rooter fixed it. For only $400.00.so then... they come back the next day to snake a camera thru the pipes.I think maybe they were looking for problems because well, they found them.Price quote.... between five to eight thousand dollars to repair some pipes.Errrrrrrrrrrr..... I don't think so.Did they do a good job with the problem at hand?  Yep.Were they expensive?  Yeah.... I guessDo I think they're now looking for an extra paycheck?  What do you think?~~#~0
I have been here for breakfast twice.  Both times the food was very good (love the biscuits and gravy!).  It is a bit of an older building and everything looks a bit run down.  Service has not been phenomenal.    Last time we arrived the host person had just left to seat the couple that walked in before us.  The manager and FOUR additional servers were standing at the cash register chatting.  As the entry way is small..I could hear their conversation.  It was just chit chat...not a meeting, nothing important....but apparently not one of them could see fit to either acknowledge our existence or walk us to one of the many open tables.  After a few minutes the host came back and took us to our table.  I assumed the manager just felt that taking a group to their table (or asking one of the wait staff to do it) was beneath her.  But then as soon as we were taken away, she promptly seated the family that walked in behind us.  Grrrrr...  I enjoy the food, the portions are large.  The food is very heavy comfort food.  Service is so-so and the manager does not seem to care about her customers.   If not for the service I would give them a 4.~~#~0
Love Sam's Club! Especially those little red velvet cupcakes and Chocolate wine ... the best! We always do most of our grocery shopping here. Always a treat.~~#~1
I have been eating at this Waffle house since I was a teenager and it has never failed to provide good food.  The employees are courteous and the service is fast.  The portions are good for the price and the small dinner feel is great to eat in.  I have gone here many times with my disabled brother and have never had any problems with the staff or employees.  I also like the fact that they are one of the few 24 hr restaurants available to eat at and this has come in handy many times.~~#~1
Don't do business at this unethical business. My $25 savings account from 2009 was  recently stolen from $5 a month for "account inactivity" fees. They are a bunch of crooks.It appears you now need to nickle and dime your customers with BS fees in order to stay in business. Account closed.~~#~1
Can't wait to go here again. Had the shrimp po-boy and some homemade banana pudding. I'll write more as I try different things on the menu, but what I did have was delicious.~~#~1
I love the urban feel of this place, and the swanky Apple Store is a big enough draw for me! The place is brand new, so not too many things are going on yet, but more stores are opening all the time! There's now a really high-end iPic movie theater, a frozen yogurt place, a great Nike store, and much more to come in addition to H&M, West Elm, and the delicious Oakville Grocery Co. Parking is fine and it's easy to navigate. When you're done here you can walk to Kierland across the street, too! :)Can't wait to see what they do here in a few years!~~#~1
The hubby and I stayed here on our wedding night. We didn't arrive until midnight or so (we partied late :)) and the service was still impeccable. After our car was valeted and we were golf-carted down to our casita, we were left to enjoy our night of solitude. The room itself was beautiful; king sized bed, fireplace, patio overlooking the golf course, vanity, ipod dock, jetted tub, separate shower, and plush robes and slippers. We ordered room service probably close to 1 am and it arrived promptly. The boy ordered the veggie wrap (he said it was delish) and I ordered the tossed greens salad with balsamic. For $13 the salad was a total miss. Just a few mediocre lettuce leaves, tomatoes, onions, and cucumbers thrown on a plate. I was hungry though, so it worked.The next morning we slept in as late as we could. I woke up with the worst heartburn (thanks, balsamic!) so I called the front desk for some Tums. No problem, they arrived pronto. We packed up and called for a ride, and although they said they were busy, they arrived shortly after. I would love to come back here and stay a little longer. The service was great, the place was beautiful, and for the one night we were there it was damn perfect.~~#~1
If you're looking for a dining experience at Fry's deli area you're better off going to an actual sit down restaurant.  Fry's "dining style" food in the deli area is very substandard at the best.~~#~1
Meh. As my fellow Yelper said to me a few days after we ate here: "No Brio review, I'm shocked!" I didn't jump on writing this review because I was pretty underwhelmed by the experience. The ambience sucks, the service wasn't very good and the food was totally average. My cursor is blinking at me and I still don't know what else to say about my time spent here. Ambience- looks like an Italian cheesecake factory. Why are the collumns so huge?!Service- the bartender kept interrupting us to take our order when we STILL weren't ready. Jeez, does it look like I've moved my menu in the 53 seconds it's been since the last time you checked? And then disappeared when we were finally ready. Food- -carpaccio, not bad but does it seriously need to be that huge? The two of us didn't even come close to finishing it. -Mediterranean pasta, pretty much the only one without a cream sauce on the whole menu. They split it for us which was nice and it tasted all right with mushrooms and chicken and stuff. -tiramisu came out frozen. They were super apologetic and didn't charge us for the replacement, but it was still awkward. They obviously just heated up a piece which made it melty and just not that great.So yeah, that's that.~~#~0
RIPI drive by here every day but looked over and saw the place dark inside and the signage ripped down. They never did quite recover from the roof collapse thing. Was the only Vietnamese place by my work, now sadly, there are none. They should have offered Banh Mi for lunch. Woulda-coulda-shoulda.~~#~0
The first couple of times I ate here I wasn't sure why people were always so crazy for this place. It's been about two years since my last visit and in the past couple of months I've already been here like three times and wanted to go back more. I've decided that it's all about what you order; for example the first time I went I probably felt overwhelmed with all the choices and decided to go for something really plain like turkey with hardly any toppings, have fun! Their menu has a wide variety of yummy sandwiches and lots of new tastes to try. Also, don't be afraid to speak up. I was a little disappointed by the lack of lettuce and veggies on one of my veggie sandwiches but I also didn't pay attention. Now I ask for lots of lettuce and they're happy to make it the way I like. They make their breads fresh and they have garlic-herb bread that has lots of flavor. I won't order a sandwich from there without a side of ranch dressing. I am a picky ranch eater...I hate mayonnaise so I am always super careful that ranch doesn't taste or resemble mayo. I usually like restaurant mayo that is a little more runny in consistency with lots of flavor. They have the best home made ranch dressing here! Pair it with the garlic-herb bread and your sandwich is going to be booming in flavor. OMG! Wipe...sorry I just started to drool a bit. Service is good...everyone runs at the same chill pace which seems to go well with the theme of this restaurant. My current favorite is the Humboldt sandwich...I get the Pinner (8") but I swear some days I am so hungry I think I'm going to order the Blunt (12")...maybe someday soon. All sandwiches get toasted. Okay so toppings: Guacamole, sprouts, lettuce/spring mix, onions, mushrooms, tomatoes, black olives (I get mine w/o), cucumbers, pickles, your choice of cheese (I get Swiss), with their house goodies (EVOO, vinegar, herb mixture on top). Now that I found my sandwich, I crave it all the time and can't wait for my next visit. Oh, be sure to check their daily specials too! If you're lucky enough to be in their delivery area...well, darn you then! :-)~~#~1
Staff is nice, and that's it.They use very cheap tires that only last for a year.~~#~1
The customer service at this Macy's was seriously out of this world. Both my mom and I (who were visiting from out of town; me, San Diego and her, Baltimore) have never ever experienced such friendly and helpful customer service at any department store, anywhere, EVER! We were there late at night- probably for the 2 hours right before closing on a one day sale day. In every single dept. We went (ladies dresses, ladies shoes, men's etc) EVERYONE was soooo nice and helpful. Most of our visit was in ladies dresses. Those reps did everything possible to help us find dresses in different sizes (which can definitely be challenging at the end of a season and at the end of a one day sale when things are haphazardly placed everywhere) and to call other Macy's stores when we were unsuccessful in finding a dress at that location in a particular size. Sure, they wanted a sale, but to be so helpful so late at night, right before closing, after a long one day sale was shocking. We must have encountered at least 10 different sales associates while wondering through the store and each and every one was soooo nice and helpful. The selection (at least in women's) was better than most other Macy's I've been to, to boot. I wish this was my local Macy's! Go here- hopefully your experience is just as good as mine :)~~#~1
I don't know why I waited so long to visit Yogurtology; it's located conveniently next to my Safeway.  Why did i wait so long?!Yogurtology has perfected self-serve froyo.  The flavors are spot-on...lemon meringue, birthday cake, NSA coffee, peach mango tart, cheesecake, mango, rootbeer...the list goes on...I always end up getting oatmeal cookie.  It's made in-house with real oatmeal cookies.  We're talking oatmeal cookie literally IN the froyo, none of that artificial flavor crap.  It is incredible.  Instead of having little placards for the flavors, there are digital Sony TV screens that describe each flavor and a brief nutritional run-down.  Very high-tech!The selection of toppings is unparalleled--baklava, three different kinds of twix and milky way, brownie, chocolate chip cookie bar, chocolate covered waffle cone, premium fruit and nuts...anything you can imagine, Yogurtology has it.  Not only that, but the shop is impeccably clean, and the staff are consistently cheerful.  This place blows Yogurtland and Yogurtopia AND all other Yogurtology locations out of the water!!!This is where you want to go.~~#~1
I grew up at this library.  And now I am old and married and hope to someday take my very own kids to this library.  They have a great selection of audio books.  I am a major audio book fan and this is the place to be! Clean, safe, you are not bothered by stranger dangers.  I dig this library.~~#~1
Terrible rolls. The Dragon was so so. The California was bland and the Spicy Tuna was cat food. Seriously, it  looked like canned cat food and tasted horrible.~~#~1
Having just moved to Scottsdale, I had seen Four Peaks brews at local restaurants and couldn't wait to try it. My bf and I visited the brewery after a long day at the Phoenix Zoo. The location was easy to find with plenty of street parking (although it could be difficult during peak hours). We found a nice table on the half-indoor seating area. The ambiance was very cool, with a converted loft warehouse sort of feel.The bf had the beer sampler, which I helped myself to some sips of. I ordered a pint of the Kilt Lifter, which was a great deal during happy hour. Next, I tried the Pumpkin Porter (full price, even during happy hour). Foodwise, I had the pub fish and chips, which are battered in Kilt Lifter, and the bf had the french dip. Both items were on par with good quality pub fare.Kilt Lifter: great medium brew, very smooth. The type of beer you could drink every day and never tire of. Pumpkin Porter: we loved it so much, we purchased a growler so we could take some home! Note: there is an extra charge for filling up a growler with a seasonal brew. $4 for the growler itself, $10 for beer, and $5 seasonal charge. Normal refills of growlers are $10.I am a beer lover. I have spent time living in Munich and drinking some of the best beers in the world. You can't go wrong with Four Peaks brews. Next stop, North Scottsdale location. Closer to home and hopefully just as great!~~#~1
Love this place! Just went here and ordered the petite filet and lobster tail, everything is so good here. I also love the pork chop! My favorite dessert is the lava cake hot and yummy.~~#~1
Ok, so, I finally ate at Wanda's.  It is located right near the Chandler Harley Davidson, and its alright.  The seating is really intimate, and rather small.  The largest table in this place is for seating of 4. I didnt care for how small it was, in regards to limited seating.  They do have outdoor seating, but again, they lost points with me for only having tables for either 2 or 4.  What I DO like about it, is that the service was quick, and its not the usual chain resturants like IHOP or Waffle house.  Limited menu, only open a few hours a day (like 7-3) and primarily have a breakfast and lunch menu.~~#~0
The cheesy breadsticks were delicious.  Everything else, not so much.~~#~1
My favorite restaurant in AZ, No Contest!!! Awesome staff, delicious food and the best salsa!!!!~~#~1
This is a huge improvement over the last bar that occupied this spot. They obviously put a few bucks into the renovation and added pool tables. The rub is that when a band is playing here it totally dominates the conversation, and if the band sucks...  Please put in a smoking-friendly patio, right now customers have to stand by the parking lot sans drink! They have another less-noisy bar in the front, which I was pleased to discover was offering $1 well drinks from 9-10pm for guys -  we took full advantage.~~#~0
This isn't your typical Mexican restaurant that puts cheese and sour cream on everything. The food here is light, simple, and fresh. We started out with the guacamole which was amazing. My sister doesn't even like mandarin oranges but it tasted so good in the guacamole she was eating it like it was going out of style. The salsa that came with it was the bomb. One was a spicy red salsa and the other one was a tomatillo salsa. The green one was so good I wanted to drink it. I ordered the chorizo and eggs and my sister ordered a couple of tacos with rice and beans. Everything tasted great and I even had room for dessert after my meal. We had some kind of carmel, banana, crepe thing. It doesn't look like much but it was one of the best desserts I've ever had. Gallo Blanco is my new obsession.~~#~1
I agree with Rachel C. & Luciana L. on the parking situation and the logistics of the whole place.  Although I will probably go again because my kids do enjoy it and I was able to get the last paid parking spot (at 11am).  I have been to this event and others in downtown Glendale and they can't handle the volume of people that go to these things.  Downtown Glendale is similar to downtown Scottsdale but 1/10th the size and capacity.  There are tons of little shops in a historic district with ONE parking garage and whats worse is you will pass many empty lots that they pay cops to stand around just to make sure you dont park there.  I finally ask a police officer where CAN we actually park.  Anyway, the event was cool with lots for the kids, it is a farmers market that sells food you would find at the fair thrown in with some chocolate vendors, jumpers and carnival type rides for the kids in separate areas that require separate tickets for each area (this was way annoying too).  Glendale could do better by putting up directories everywhere for people to know where they are, where bathrooms are, and they could spread things out and offer more space per human being (I am sure this place is stupid in the evening).  Plus they need to do something about parking, even if they build a HUGE garage and charge $20 a car at least there would be options for people who dont want to walk a mile before they walk around for miles....All that said, we will probably go next year because we still do not know the definition of insanity.~~#~0
When owners/staff changed we kept hoping for the best.  (The friendly owners/cooks of the previous restaurant were top notch, hence the good reviews).  But now, alas. . . Lemon chicken that turned out to be pork (and bad at that), wontons in soup that fall apart, greasy greasy lo mein and eggrolls, it's just not worth it.  Prefer to give locals the business, but this is truly awful, even after many hopeful tries.  Panda Express it is until someone else does a better job.~~#~1
We have been taking our dogs to All-Star since they opened. The staff has always been great and remembers our girls by name, and the Vets are fantastic! Any Dr who will get down on the ground and love on my doggies is ok in my book. They have squeezed us in for emergency visits many times. We have also boarded our dogs here and they take awesome care of them. Just wish they were opened on the weekends~~#~1
I enjoyed my nights here.  The facilities are clean and very well maintained.  Housekeeping staff is fantastic also.  They were not intrusive and they were hospitable.  However, the ONE thing that bothered me was the reception staff.  I was mistreated.  I say this because I asked the reception staff a question about the pool hours and the response I received was "Are you a guest here?"  Followed by "because we get a lot of people around here..."  While that response is completely understandable, I must point out that I checked in an hour earlier with the SAME staff at the desk.  This may be me sounding like a self-centered, remember me-type of person, but no.  I felt that the receptionist was categorizing me because of my age and because of my look.  I guess I just look like the type that would crash into a hotel pool?  Mind you, this Residence Inn is adjacent to the Mayo Clinic and desert land.  Yes, the only two things around walking distance are this hotel and the hospital.  So apparently, this hotel pool must be the hot spot for pool crashers.  Must be all the sickly patients that want to take a dip in the pool.  Then on the same occasion, the same reception staff told me that they did not have a bottle opener at the desk.  There is a small convenient store next to the reception desk that sells wine, beer, water, soda, snacks, etc.  I purchased a beer and asked them if they had a bottle opener so I could drink my beer by the fire pits and they said no.  It had been misplaced.  Some time later, the nice gentleman that helped me open my beer got beers at the reception desk and somehow, they magically had a bottle opener.  Strange how they had one for him, but not for me. Regardless, I was a bit bummed that the reception staff was childish and rude to me.  I felt like I was individually singled out to be discriminated against.  It's a shame too because I love my Marriott Rewards card.  The rooms are large here.  The elevator takes forever!  I suggest that the hotel adopt elevator music to distract the sluggish speed of that elevator.~~#~0
Unique place that you wouldn't stop at unless you were recommended.  Seriously, this isn't the type of place you drive by and say 'oh, let's stop there' -- word of mouth is what I'm guessing drives this business.We were recommended to visit this place by the entertainer for the evening, a belly dancer.  Efes isn't your typical sit-down restaurant -- in fact, you may have to kneel down.  The environment is to set a casual Turkish dinner setting.  If you have a big party, some of you may be sitting on the floor...don't worry, there are plenty of pillows.The entertainment was good (if you like belly dancing) and the music was interesting.  Our party of 4 opted for the super sampler to start and the Efes mix to share.I personally like this type of food.  Exotic, full of spices, not your typical meats.  My wife didn't necessarily find it great, but ate some and didn't complain :-).  I think the Doner Kabob was the best.  If you go with a group, the Efes mix was a great way to try a little of everything and was plenty of food for our party of 4.~~#~0
My first box of NGD arrived a few weeks and tears nearly came to my eyes as I removed the produce from the box.  I haven't seen such beautiful, fresh, well packaged produce since I was a kid (and I'm no spring chicken).  The carrots tasted like the sweet carrots I remember and the lettuce (with the dirt from the farm still fresh on the leaves) so full of flavor.  The amazing thing is that I had come to expect most organic vegetables and fruits to be less visually appealing than the chemical type but such is not the case with NGD.The medium size box has been perfect for our little family of four.  It is delivered on our day like clockwork around 2am.  The unseen elf that drops off the goodies is nice enough to open the carton and place all the contents in our cooler so everything stays nice in this boiling cauldron we call Phoenix.  Furthermore, I live way out in Carefree/Cave Creek where we always expect to be on the list of places too far away for delivery.  Not with NGD.  It appears from the labeling they have optimized their routes so they can include many outlying areas. Finally, there is a gentleman named Ben that works for NGD.  He has been very helpful in making sure everything is going smoothly and that we are using the service properly.We think NGD is a great value for organic produce delivered to your door and HIGHLY recommend NGD!~~#~1
Went here for the first time today.  Loved it.  Becca was fun/professional and did a great job.I have been looking for a place to get a "big boy haircut" since I moved in the area a few months ago, so far Canyon Falls has impressed me. Normally I just settle for whats cheap and quick from an $11 haircut place. Yes, I paid more for my cut at Canyon Falls... but it was worth it.  The place is clean, the employees are clean, I was greeted right away when I came in and I left FEELING like I got a good cut.  I was only in for a cut/shampoo so I cant comment on any of the other services they offer but,  I think I might have found a my new place to get my hair cut...at last.  Thanks Becca.~~#~1
I go here a lot. Well...used to. Service gets worse and worse. Food isn't as good as it once was. Happy hour is amazing though!~~#~0
Great, fun atomosphere! Service was great! My wife and I had a wonderful date night here.  The fillet was nicely cooked and the sides were just as good.  Average prices but great value! Highly recommend this place for date night!~~#~1
Manager got a little whiney when I insisted that he check his shelf before I drive out to pick up a rare item.  Their stock has been in error before, and sure enough... it was wrong this time.  But no apology of course, and no acknowledgment that I was right to have him check his stock.  Otherwise, selection is good on the whole, but customer service can be a little "iffy" at times.  Easy access right off Lake Pleasant Pkwy on SW corner.~~#~0
Family friendly and we love the soups and salads.  Mushroom soup is our favorite!!!!  We also enjoy their veggie sandwich but all of them that we have tried are delicious.  Sunday brunch is great too.  We do frittatas or banana pancakes, yum.  Or a simple Wildflower capaccino and scone does the trick.  We'be been going for years and will continue to go.  Oh, did I mention the free WiFi?  Great for some business lunches.~~#~1
I've played well over 40 of the Golf Magazine Top 100 courses in the US. We're lucky to have many of them here right in our backyard. This course stands out! Exemplary service, and the driving range is the best I've ever seen.The course is tough. No country club rolls here. Hit it right or left and you're undoubtedly taking a drop, and a stroke.Can't wait to get back for my next round!~~#~1
Ordered the Philly Egg Rolls. They came out still frozen in the middle. It's hit or miss if the waitress will be decent or not.~~#~0
My love affair with Pita Jungle is a long one.....perhaps longer than any other restaurant, certainly longer than I can remember, and at least for the adult portion of my life, which is why it pains me to write this review. For the last 6 months, I have ordered takeout one day a week from this location, typically on a Friday or Saturday. The ridiculousness that has become my adult life has necessitated a heavy reliance on takeout for my main source of nourishment. Although the food is always spot on at Pita, my takeout experience has been anything but. The prior 3 out of 4 times I went to pick up my food, I ended up waiting past the promised time. Now I'm not unreasonable, waiting 5 or 10 minutes is not a big deal, but each time has been a wait of 25 to 30+ minutes past the pick up time, with no apologies or explanations. I was beginning to wonder if they had ever started cooking my food before I got there. The last time I must've looked really irritated, because I was offered an obligatory baklava for my wait. Used to the wait, I started showing up 5 to 10 minutes past the promised time, just as preventative maintenance. Imagine my surprise when my order was ready as promised thie time. I left with my bag of food and a smile on my face. I get back to my friend's house, open the bag, and begin to realize just how badly the order has been screwed up. We ordered 4 items, 3 of which were wrong. I load one item up and head back to Pita. Making me wait a ridiculous amount of time for my food is one thing, but blatantly screwing up my order is too much. As I explain my situation to the takeout girl, she goes to get the Manager who proceeds to inform me that I ordered it wrong. As I struggle to keep my cool, I inform them that they must be mistaken. One item was ordered with chicken, my item was turkey, and the other two were salads. Everything came with chicken. The salads were for my vegetarian friends, and I'm allergic to chicken. There's no way you're going to convince me I ordered chicken for myself and two vegetarians. Sorry, try again. Without too much ado, the correct dishes were provided, and yet another obligatory baklava was offered. I declined. There is only so much wrong that baklava can right. Don't get me wrong, their baklava is amazing, but it's not going to make up for them screwing up my order, then trying to blame it on me. Oh, and did I mention that they gave me a coupon for a free appetizer? Too bad the coupon expires in a few days. I'm afraid I will be taking my weekly Friday takeout business elsewhere, until enough time has passed that maybe, just maybe, I can find it in my heart to forgive Pita Jungle. In the meantime, I suggest you try to get it together down there. In case you missed the count, that's 4 out of the last 5 takeouts you missed the mark on, including 1 you tried to blame on me. That's shameful.~~#~1
I went there last night with bf to celebrate our anniversary. After pre-yelp, we knew what to expect as to prices, so it wasn't so much of a shocker.To the food, we concur with almost everyone here. It was impeccable! We ordered the ice tower for 2 and thought that it was very well presented. Ours came with 3 appetizers (raw oysters, crab claws and dungeness crab) so it wasn't too high. They are all fresh. Growing up I used to go to the beach quite often just to have fresh crabs, so I know what those taste like. And for 6 years living in the desert, Mastro's is the first and only one in AZ to deliver that.  For main course, I got Ivory Salmon "Oreganata", bf got Swordfish blackened. I am quite picky when it comes to fish, and bf isn't exactly a fish person, but both of our dishes "surpassed expectation." I couldn't say much about swordfish except it was fresh. We had the same dish 2 weeks before at somewhere else, it was nowhere near as sweet and fresh as the one at Mastro's. It was my first having Ivory Salmon, it was sweeter, and white (hence the name) than normal salmon we get around here. Mine was good size portion, firm to the touch, but melted in the mouth. The flavor was subtle enough to enjoy by itself, or you can add one of the sauces provided. One of my favorite sauces of the night I think was made of minced tomatoes and olives, came with the main course.Sides were Lobster Mash and Snap peas. I didn't really care for snap peas as I can make them at home. But lobster mash is a MUST for those who go there. I'm not sure how they prepared it, but it felt like mash potatoes made with lobster bisque (instead of water and milk) and added lobster chunks. It was much more flavorful and creamy than a normal mash potatoes. It was big enough to share and take home. One thing though, it hardened up after sitting out for awhile, so I'm not sure if microwave could make it all fluffy again after 1 night in the fridge.Drinks there are amazing, from the presentation, to the taste, and definitely the amount of alcohol in each drink. We decided to go with cocktail drinks rather than wines because of other yelpers' reviews. Total worth it!!!The service was amazing. We had Robert. We pretty much asked him for recommendations for everything, yet he was nice about it and very knowledgeable. Next time we go back, I would definitely ask for him again.We didn't order dessert since they gave us a dark-chocolate "Happy Anniversary" cake with the letters written, also, in chocolate. The overall experience was 4 3/4, just because it was a bit difficult talking to each other. The acoustic of the room wasn't very good and it got loud. Didn't see much of cougar/manther scene as we were in the dining room. And maybe it was during weekdays, we saw lots of "expense account" people though~~#~1
I have had chicken. I have had waffles. And now, I've had chicken AND waffles. Prior to today, I didn't realize the distinction. Prior to today, I never had cause to consider the combination. Prior to today, I didn't realize what I was missing.Now let's be clear: this isn't the place for dieters. It's not a place for any pretentious behavior. The place has "Chicken & Waffles" in the name, OK? And that's what you're going to get. In abundance.Cheap as hell. I had the #1, also known as KK's. Three huge-ass pieces of chicken -- breas, thigh and mutant leg. All battered and fried to perfection. Two waffles the size of Vermont. A bucket of grits with some egg/cheese/onion concoction on the side. OK, I could have done without the last part. But hey, when in a chicken & waffle place...I'm still full. I won't eat dinner tonight. I crashed out for an hour in post-prandial bliss. And I'd have typed this review faster if I could have stopped sucking my fingers like a four-year-old.Damn.~~#~1
Have been going to LGO since 2003 and have always enjoyed the cuisine. Several times - either when ordering in the grocery or dining at the Pizzeria - the music has been so headsplitting as to wipe out any ambience or semblance of a welcoming neighborhood restaurant. Last night the demographic in the Pizzeria during the course of our meal ranged from 30-80 years of age. Several pleas to turn the music down just enough to be able to hear the waiter standing next to me were greeted with "it's just how we do things" and "there's no point in asking because they won't turn it down even a little". The waiter, David, said many servers consistently relay complaints but that the owner "really doesn't care". Hubris is so unappetizing. I think the food is great but, because I have no desire to support a business that really doesn't give a crap about its clientele, I'll spend my money lavishly elsewhere.~~#~1
LOVE LOVE LOVE this office!  During my high-risk pregnancy I spent a lot of time at this office and in the hospital.  Both Dr. Hahn and Dr. Spieker were fantastic, very knowledgable and easy to talk to.  I trust them completly as they did everything to ensure both myself and my baby were well taken care of.   I have since seen Dr. Cyr for a quick appointment whom is very sweet.~~#~1
I hate walking in here because it always stinks.  They really need to ventilate this place.  My daughter loves it, always had a great time, whether she is skating or attending Club 54.  Great place for birthday parties, she loved her party.  She also got a butt-load of tokens with the party package.~~#~0
Mixteca was OK. Kind of a cross between Baja Fresh and Robertos. The quesadilla was decent and the beef tacos were good also, just nothing spectacular. I would go up the street to "Carumbas" for something better.Doesn't accept AMEX:(~~#~0
This is a great alternative to national chains. Great pizza at a great price and usually a coupon is readily available. This location is no frills and the salad bar is basically extra pizza toppings. Yet its always clean and the staff is normally friendly even when phone swamped. Barros won't knock your socks off but it always has great, wallet friendly pizza pie.~~#~0
I ate here after eating at the one in San Diego a couple times.  I was a little disappointed.  The place was kind of depressing and slow moving, but I was there at 8:15 on a Tuesday.  Overall, the food wasn't that good.  I had one of the soups and it was just okay.I would definitely be willing to give this place another shot, though.  I really liked some of the stuff at the SD location and I would like to try it here.If you have never been to a Loving Hut, it is worth a visit to see the crazy TV channel and some of the inventive dishes.I strongly recommend the things that look like breaded chicken legs but are really filled with mushrooms.  That thing is tasty.~~#~0
First, I'd like to send a shout-out to Irma, our server who has given me hope that there are caring hospitable people in the food industry.  Irma receives 5 stars for taking good care of me and my sweetheart during our recent date at the Havana Cafe. Way to go Irma!We step into a well packed restaurant on a Friday night with plans to try the Sailor's Paella Special and a few cocktails. We wait for just a few seconds until we are greeted by Irma and her warm smile and are led to our table. Our cocktail orders are taken immediately, 1 Mojito and 1 White Sangria. Both exceeded our expectations and were just thing to get our date started.The ambiance is whimsical and charming - Reminded me of the movie "The Bird Cage" without the drag queens and dramatic dialogue. Bummer!Now on to the Paella. It was the perfect dish for the evening offering plenty of shrimp, calamari, crab, scallops, muscles, tuna and a healthy serving of saffron rice. This meal also requires a little handy work to get to the crab and muscles but you are given the proper instruments to do so. This may not be the best choice for those who do not enjoy this kind of food activity but we had a lot of fun with it.  We will be back soon to try another interactive meal and partake of a round or two of Mojitos. So if you are in the mood for something different, fun, and oh so delicioso, I recommend you try a night out at the Havana Cafe. I also hope you have the pleasure of meeting a groovy gal who goes by the name Irma.~~#~1
REAL NY STYLE CHINESE FOOD HERE IN ARIZONA!!! FREE HOT TEA AND FRIED WON-TON SKINS LIKE BACK HOME! (BY REQUEST)I am from New Jersey and so are the owners.  They opened up shop here 1 year after I moved here (1998) and I was delighted i could get a real NY egg-roll and spare ribs in Arizona.  Their best dish i feel is the Szechuan Garlic Chicken (or shrimp).  Try it once and you may never try anything else on the menu it's that good!!  Taste's the same as the best of NYC.Their lunch specials are amazing.  Comes with soup, spring roll, crab puff, fried rice, hot tea (by request) all for a very low price.  Sunday is Dim Sum if you like dumplings.  This place NEVER disappoints and I bring work clients here from New York all the time.they all agree, REAL NY CHINESE FOOD!!!!~~#~1
Bit over priced, but they're tea is to die for!~~#~0
This is a great place to shop, grab a bite, eat dessert, relax, or just hang around.Eat at one of the many excellent restaurants like Christopher's, Seasons 52, Black Chili Mexican, and Capitol Grill. Swing by Royal for a cappuccino, iced latte, or your favorite coffee of the day. Savor frozen delight from Haagen Dazs or Mojo Yogurt -- ahhh my sweet Mojo, you and I have been in an on and off relationship for the past year now... by off I mean the 3 or 4 days a week I'm NOT there :)  .Movies in the park nights are fun to go to; gasping, laughing, and crying with 200 of your closest (people you probably just met). Get there early for good seats, (about 30 min or more), otherwise you'll be stuck behind a tree or some tall guy you can't see around. Be sure to bring a lawn chair along or a blanket to throw down if you'll be attending one of these events.The shopping is top notch - but be sure to bring your wallet. Most shops here will cost you at least your first born child, or an equivalent value.Happy shopping to all my yelping buddies!~~#~1
Best ribs in Arizona (besides my own)!!~~#~1
We've been going here for years. Love the food (Happy Family is a favorite dish) and appreciate the community service outreach. Great to support locals who support the community ... and dish up great food along the way.~~#~1
Loved it. Pulled pork & pulled chicken, bbq sauce & the cole slaw were ALL outstanding. ONLY caveat is that GPS tries to send you to thhe wrong side of the highway. It is in the shopping center with CVS & Circle K.~~#~1
it's an Imax theater, so unless you haven't been to one then it you know it is an oversized screen with wider shots and better sound. The location itself looks dated and in need of some repair, perhaps just some paint. The viewing experience was great and I will go back if there is another flick being shown that I must see in IMAX, but the fact remains the Mall, the Theater and much of the area looks dated.~~#~0
Service here sucks.  Our "waitress" took forever to get our food, and then didn't bring utensils, plates or napkins.  I had to keep going up to the bar to get a drink.  Several times I waited too long.  One time I went up there and there was no one working there.  I should have just put on an apron and walked behind the bar myself and made my own drink.  Still, they have an awesome set up outside for enjoying the warm Phoenix nights.  I dont' understand why the band has to play inside.  I guess people who live nearby complained about the noise.  Then don't live next to a f*cking bar!!! Idiots.~~#~0
Great new addition to the Old Town neighborhood. Citizen is versatile -- the perfect place for a romantic date, a small gathering, or for just meeting a buddy for a drink. A place with a great vibe.My first impression was that they are intently focused on service quality. Lots of smiling staff to greet you as you enter. Every employee is attentive to every table. Our server was gregarious, accommodating, gracious, and highly proactive. We definitely felt the 'warm and fuzzy' atmosphere.They pay attention to the little things -- such as house-made ketchup for your french fries. The food: about as good as upscale bar food is going to get. For apps we started with the calamari and the crabcakes. Portions weren't large, but very high quality. The calamari was flash-fried and not greasy, and seemed very fresh. For my entree I had the wagyu burger, which was prepared perfectly and served on a fresh challah bun.Overall impression: Citizen will have staying power, unlike many establishments that open in Old Town. The formula is really pretty simple -- offer high quality stuff, equip the place with great staff, and don't go overboard with prices. I'm looking forward to returning!~~#~1
While Calabria Italian Kitchen & Deli is at this location the Grocery portion has been CLOSED.~~#~1
Went here while on vacation in Phoneix based on seeing it on Man vs Food. Could not have been more impressed. Food was amazing. Far above expectations.  The torta was huge and delicious. Would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fantastic authentic meal at a good price!~~#~1
Totally agree with the rest of the reviewers about this being the usual greasy, meat-heavy Mexican restaurant with no frills, but soul-satisfying stomach-filling food. If you're on a diet or if you're the lettuce-eating, fat-free-everything types, you'd do best to steer clear of Poliberto's--everything is unabashedly huge and dripping in lard here. I wanted to get the three tacos combo, but since I'm a recent beef-eater, I couldn't stomach the description of tongue and beef head being included in the tacos. Though I figure it must be tasty :PAnyway, I got the chicken taco and the carne asada taco and got plenty of lemon wedges and salsa. The tacos were huge. The asada was more delicious than the chicken. The chicken came topped with lettuce and shredded cheese and had a hard shell, which I was definitely not expecting, and didn't like. Other than that...Ok to eat at when you're hungry and want to save a buck.~~#~0
I thought it was ok, hubby thought it was spectacular.  I tried to order my standard soy vanilla latte but they were out of vanilla - to me that's like a hamburger joint being out of ketchup.  So I got a mocha instead - nice coffee flavor, but the chocolate didn't taste so special.  Hubby had a cappuccino and would definitely get it again.~~#~0
My mother and I were actually getting out of the car to go to Streets of New York next door when she smelled the Mexican food and suggested we try Roberto's instead.  That should tell you what you need to know right there.It's a hole in the wall place for sure, and leaves much to be desired visually, but the staff was exceptionally pleasant and the tables were clean.  If you're looking for fine dining, this isn't your place.  At $7-$10 for an entree, though, it was delicious.Beans, rice, and chips were pretty standard, but the salsa, fish taco, and shredded beef tostada were very flavorful.  The food tastes homemade, and in this case, that's a good thing.This place was also featured on TLC's Diners and Drive-ins show back in the day.  One of Anthem's best kept secrets.  I'll be back!~~#~1
I have been eating here since high school, so i can safley say bout 35 years. The food is still as good as it was when 15 of us would jump into Smitty's vw van and drive down for our 30 minuet lunch break. (West high of course) It has been owned by the same family since it opened in the early 1800's!!! Yes the cheese crisp are awesome but the tacos not the shredded beef but the regular tacos are the best in town. Order a couple they are sooo good. Love you Los.~~#~1
I LOVE DIlly's! I always get the Dilly Club and Chicken Noodle Soup, which comes with a bread bowl that is oh so yummy!~~#~1
Creative Healing Solutions is a fantastic naturopathic doctors office.      I'm so grateful that I found this place and met Dr. Roxie Strand and her wonderful assistant, Melissa.  My life has changed so much for the better since April 2012 when I walked into her office super frustrated with many previously unsuccessful weight loss attempts.   Dr. Roxie was attentive and thorough, and suggested I consider HCG.   I had never heard of it before then, so I went home and did my research.  I was a little nervous, but never felt any pressure and when I decided to give it a try, I felt very at ease being under her supervision.  Now, I'm 85 lbs lighter and feel better than I have in years.   I could go on and on and speak to how wonderful the program, office and Dr. Strand are, but I simply suggest that you consider visiting Dr. Roxie yourself if you are seeking to address medical issues that you haven't been able to solve before.  She does a free consultation and is genuinely interested in helping find a holistic health solution for you.   I never thought I could totally change my lifestyle, but Dr. Roxie definitely helped me find a way to do it and has been a major supporter in my journey, which I appreciate so much!    Whether you are in need of a weight loss solution or need someone to help with other medical matters, I fully recommend Dr. Strand.~~#~1
After spending a combined seven years as a graduate student at ASU, imagine my dissapointment when I came to discover that there was finally decent Asian food walking distance from campus... two months after my departure for internship in San Diego. Dragonfly combines what I like about Vietnamese food (variety, flavor, price) with what I like about a modern, trendy restaurant (good decor, modern music, attentive servers). Though everything on the menu is above average, one item really stands out; cha gio cream cheese. I believe at this location it's called tiger rolls. Completely inauthentic, and I couldn't care less. DAMN they're good. When I drive in from San Diego, I often head there on my first night in town, occasionally as soon as I hit the Phoenix area, before stopping off to drop off my bags. Honestly one of the best things I've tasted anywhere. Highly highly recommend.~~#~1
I had lunch here today with co workers and it was absolutely delicious! Cannot wait to go back gain.~~#~1
Food was decent, smaller portions which is GOOD, friendly service. Not the cleanest but a decent meal with good prices. It would get 4 stars if the food had just a little more flavor.~~#~0
Some highlights- Loved the special of the day: red velvet pancakes breakfast with cream cheese topping. YUM YUM YUM- Corned beef hash is canned and not homemade :( sad face- Fried Chicken breakfast is a huge portion- tasted really well but definitely sad that they only have sausage gravy. Would love it if they could offer a non pork gravy for the non oink eaters. Overall, it was delicious, simple menu, great service (Thanks to Waitress Kelly she was really nice) and would much rather support local eateries than Ihop or Denny's anyday.~~#~0
OOOOOWWWEEEE!! Have yall tried ATL Wings yet!!! If not what are you waiting for!  They are the BOMB Diggity!I don't know why I haven't updated my review either, so here I go! The honey habanero are still my #1 but I also love the Cajun Hot!  Holy Crap!! Get some of the Cajun Hot wings and some ranch and their hot sauce on the side, dip your wing in the ranch and then the hot sauce and watch out!! The only time you really feel the burn is when you're no longer eating, gums & tongue just be blaze hot and mouth just be water for more, yes my friends that's the heat I love!!Luv me some wings from ATL!~~#~1
Wow this place is great. The whole atmosphere is unique. Bowling, bars, dj - it's an awesome idea. Only thing is on a Friday, it's super busy and takes along time to get a bowling lane.~~#~1
Perfect hotel for my conference travel needs.  Clean, new, great bars, close to other food options across the street, super friendly staff.  Great business traveler property.  The bed was SOOO comfortable.  Sometimes, Starwood beds can be too soft, but this was just right.  Access to the convention center is so convenient.  Just out the door and down a block and a half.  Can't beat that in the heat!~~#~1
Duane is amazing!  Reliable, Responsive, Reasonably Priced, i simply can't reccomend him enough!  I've used him four separate times now and have been more than happy with each visit.  I won't call anyone else!~~#~1
This place seems to get better every time I visit. The first time was a Friday night out with the guys. We met up for dinner and I had (and loved) the pulled pork and sweet potato fries. After dinne we got our drink on with a live band. The waitress was helpful in getting us drunk off a variety of liquors. And the shots kept on coming! It was a blast. The second time was more laid back, just grabbing a beer with a girlfriend. It was a Tuesday and the place was pretty busy. The next time me and the girlfriend showed up completely wasted and they had an Irish band playing. It was a perfect way to end our night after clubbing at the gay bar! We had a baileys nightcap and everything went dark from there. Awesome night!~~#~1
Amazing place. I had the swordfish with pasta and fresh veggies. Delicious great service! Although the check was a little late the waiter brough amaretto on the rocks to apologize!~~#~1
Last time I went it was lunchtime on a weekday.  Our server was very quick and attentive.  The sushi lunch deal was *amazing.*  Piping hot miso, delicate seaweed salad, crisp cucumber salad, flavorful sauteed veggies, fresh orange slices and the main attraction - tuna, yellowtail and salmon all absolutely fresh and perfectly prepared.  I left totally stuffed and happy.  One caveat - they should turn down the music a little during lunch; happy hour should be one level of noise and lunch should be several octaves below that.~~#~1
My house is clean using pet-friendly products.  They arrive on time.  I know that some of the reviews talk about having trouble reaching them by phone, but I have never had a problem reaching them by email (which I prefer).  The ladies show up, work quickly and efficiently, and are on their way.  I couldn't be happier.~~#~1
Hidden House has some things you expect in a neighborhood bar: lots of pool tables, giant circular bar, tagged restroom, friendly locals (somehow curious or maybe protective), cheap cocktails and specials on pitchers of beer. Then there's a few things different about this place: an usual mix of suits and sweat pant, old and young, some talented pool players and a really smooth bartender. Located in the "new" downtown and within walking distance from my hotel. The walk there and back was actually as much fun as sitting in the lounge, some parts of downtown are stunning especially at night when the lights are on and nobody's "home".~~#~0
Thanks fellow yelpers for brining us to Four Peaks!  My husband and I were stuck in Phoenix for the night and needed a place for dinner.  Ironically we ended up at Four Peaks (a Vikings bar) on our way back home to Minnesota.  My husband loves beer (brews a ton of his own) and especially enjoyed the beer sampler. Trying 10 beers for around $9, yes please!  I don't really love beer so I had a cider and it was exactly what I needed.  For dinner I had the turkey burger with fries.  The turkey burger was standard but the fries were awesome.  I think it was the beer batter.  My husband go the carne adovada and he raved.  I think he may try to convince me to fly back to Phoenix just for that dish!The atmosphere was also great.  It was very laid back and fun to be able to sit amongst the beer being made.  I highly recommend Four Peaks whether you are a Phoenix native or otherwise!~~#~1
It was consistently the best carne adobada, now consistency is the one thing they don't have. Beer selection, menu, wait staff and most importantly quality seem to change every time I'm in. Please figure it out soon...~~#~0
Ever since I was diagnosed with a Gluten intolerance, Chipotle's yummy burrito bowl has been my constant companion. The barbacoa is seasoned well and works even better with a kick of the Chipote Tabassco sauce!~~#~1
I stayed here for a night over Memorial weekend and had a pretty decent time.  It's difficult to give a star rating here because some things were awesome and some things sucked, so I ended up with middle of the road...Awesome1. My first server of the day, a cute brunette, was all smiles & friendly.  She wasn't hovering but just seemed to appear when I was ready to order another drink.  Her recommended mojito was very good.2. Location, Location, Location3. There was a really cool bellman who helped me with my bags when I arrived and again when I checked out.  He retrieved an item I had left at the pool from lost & found and was just all-around nice to chat with.SUCK1. My 2nd server lost my ID.  LOST MY ID on Memorial Weekend.  Can you imagine the fun?2. I had a lovely view of a rooftop full of trash.3. The pool was gross.  WTF is with selling tickets to lounge at your pool when you already have a full hotel of paying guests?  Thanks for screwing me out of a lounge chair, good service, some measure of exclusivity by letting every d-bag with $20 squeeze in your tiny pool. Frankly, I think 3 stars is being pretty generous for this experience.~~#~0
Great food, bad service. Does anyone speak english in here?~~#~0
The lemon grass pork is 2 stars on a generous day. Disappointing, since they tout their Vietnamese selections as being specialties. The pork was tough and the noodles were more like lo mein than the vermicelli type rice noodles I was expecting. Portions are certainly generous enough... I like that you can make your own rice bowl. That's the direction I recommend if you come here.~~#~0
Coffee is pretty good, but, well, I wasn't thrilled with the ambiance, or the barista. The first time I went, they were having a shift change and forgot to make our drinks. The second, the Batista was kinda brusque. Also, I agree with H C's comments... I walked in and everyone stopped and stared...not great ambiance,but good coffee.~~#~0
Went here for happy hour with the missus after work today and it was good enough that I'd go back but not the best that I've had. We ordered the tuna sashimi, spicy tuna roll, soft shell crap roll and at the recommendation of the waiter, the fake and bake roll.sashimi - Good, not great. Could of been a bit colder.spicy tuna roll - better than the sashimi but not epic.soft shell crab roll - this was actually my favourite tonite. It had the right amount of texture and flavour.fake and bake - they must of used some sort of torch to brown the top, probably powered by lighter fluid as all I could taste was the burnt part on top. Would of been fabulous if they didn't try to set the food on fire.Close to work, I'll be back again. Prices and the all day happy hour are both great.~~#~0
I have been going to Arizona Auto Care since about 2002 when I worked in the same complex. I have since worked all around the valley and moved out of state and back and I have always only taken my vehicles there for service! They are honest and professional and always take excellent care of my vehicles. Jeff is one of the owners and a Subaru master tech and has worked on countless Subaru's for me, friends and family! Jeff and team will give you honest and sound advice when fixing your car and not try to oversell you just to make up sales and quotas like the stealerships. Thanks again Jeff, Chris & guys at AZ Auto Care for years of great service and to many more!~~#~1
MARGARITA time....I love their ritas on the rocks!!! Their shrimp tacos are my favorite in town. I love the salsa bar. The wait staff has always been nice. The prices of  food and drink are great. This is a great place to go with friends to eat good mexican food & kick back a few drinks. The patio area is nice all year round.~~#~1
I will preface this by saying that I went here a couple years ago for lunch and thought it was very good, which gave it an extra star over my true opinion of my dinner there last night.The BF and I went here before seeing Louis CK for our anniversary. We were seated right away, so that was nice, but it was like 5:45 so that isn't too shocking. We sat outside, which was nice and had pretty christmas lights on all of the trees. The waiter comes by after about 5 minutes and asks us for drinks or apps and we ordered the burrata as an app. The menu said it was topped with a balsamic glaze, which sounded wonderful. We were also ready to order our pizza but the waiter disappeared immediately after taking our app order. So we wait. and wait. and wait. And I swear it felt like it was a half hour, but it was probably more like 10-15 minutes later (we were super hungry) the waiter came back to take our pizza order. We ordered the La Noce and he left. Well.... we waited some more. Finally got our burrata and it was a mess. Two giant globs of cheese with the lightest drizzle of balsamic dressing (not vinegar, because there is no way this weak stuff was straight up vinegar) surrounded by bread and prosciutto. It was large, so I'll give them that.... but too large in my opinion, because there isn't enough bread for the toppings. The burrata was good, creamy.... but it didn't taste like balsamic at all, which was the most appealing part of the app. The prosciutto was alright... it didn't have a ton of flavor, but it was fine. The bread had a burnt flavor... not my fave. Then we wait about 20 minutes.... waiter did not check on us.... Finally get the pizza. The pizza was good. That was the redeeming item of the night. It had arugula, walnut, ricotta, and mozz. It was a tasty combination. Now, the whole time we were there, there was a table of about 6-8 extremely loud, drunk, possibly old sorority girls sitting near us. All we could hear is their conversation, so much so, that we knew one girl was named rochelle and one was Tina and one had been divorced for 4 years and they had a friend named Lori who was just sooo crazy among many other details that we should not have gathered from sitting in their proximity, which obviously puts a damper on the experience. The waiter was so occupied with them, that we felt forgotten about all night. He was not attentive, he did not ask how things were, and he disappeared for long periods of time to go do who knows what for this other table (they had a bunch of ridiculous requests like splitting the bill 6-8 ways when the menu says they don't do that... hmmm). We sat down at 5:45 and barely got out of there around 7 to make it to our show (we were walking). So the experience wasn't a good one, BUT I would be willing to try it again, as I did have a very nice lunch there a few years ago.~~#~0
Ok first off, with the demise of Soma and the fact that Green is in Tempe.....this place is a welcome sight, and I know I'll be back. The food is excellent. However I feel that Dr Weil has has has the wool pulled over his eyes by Mr. Fox. Come one "Anazazi Beans" and a drink called the "Medicine Man"? Really- as an American Indian rights advocate you'd think we'd be past this. Actually, you'd think educated white men with lots of money would be past this --but ya know. Just because Anazazi really refers to Ancestral Pueblo people who lived mainly in NM and N. AZ and means "ancient enemy" in Navajo so that term isn't used by nearly ANYONE anymore...means that you probaby shouldn't call your dish by that name. Other than that- I give em props for trying.I recently had another experience there where EVERYTHING was going wrong that night, and the staff recovered....kinda. My advice, shape up if ya wanna last.~~#~0
Went back, they appeared to have remodeled and noise level was greatly reduced.  Food, atmosphere, everything still wonderful.  In my first review, I stated "the only reason I'm giving it less than 5-stars is because of the noise level."  As the noise level issue appears to have been rectified, my review is subsequently being modified to reflect this.Last time I was there I had a salmon salad, which was good though in all honesty the salmon was the star of the dish.  I asked the server to please ask the chef how the salmon was cooked so such perfection.  I honestly did not expect for any type of response.  Lo and behold, a gentleman came out and explained the procedure utilized to get that sear and texture without overcooking or under-cooking the salmon.Re: Another reviewer's issue with "soggy fried calamari"It is tempura calamari, which is different from other ways to fry the calamari.  I have never had any issues with sogginess unless I leave it to sit for too long.  Hmm...  Clearly, they prefer Zinc Bistro.  Honestly, I haven't been to Zinc Bistro so I cannot draw a comparison at this time between the two.I will definitely go back as soon as I can to The Greene House -- Oh, loved the recent press on the Chef's high praise, it *is* well deserved!~~#~1
I can't believe no one has talked about Pasta Tuesday. Definitely the best time to go but make sure you get there early because the pasta literally runs out. It is that good. They have this guy (Guido) come every Tuesday and he starts making hand made pasta early in the morning. He picks 2 unique dishes. It was one of the best pasta I have EVER tasted. I crave it all the time. I had a fettucini noodle in a alfredo creme sauce with herbs and pine nuts on top. I can't even describe the taste (wow what a good food critic i am). You just have to go check it out. I am going TONIGHT!~~#~1
Closed?  Really?  It seems this place just randomly shut down, after much less than a year of being open.  Only went there once - we enjoyed the food, the ambiance, and the beer.  We recommended it to others as well.  Showed up on a Tuesday night for dinner and everything was packed up....?  A little searching on the web (Facebook, specifically) shows that they're done.  What a shame.~~#~0
For mall food this place is great. Love the pitas, rice, and yummy potatoes.~~#~0
I've brought my dogs here and met with both Dr. Holmes and Dr. Edwards and they were both extremely knowledgeable and helpful. Over the last 15 years of living in Phoenix we brought all 6 dogs that we have had in that time to come see them and I wouldn't go anywhere else. This past summer I moved to Boston and regrettably haven't found a quality veterinary hospital like Pecan Grove. Ashamedly, even after talking to my current vet and be unsatisfied with their answers, we called Pecan Grove and Dr. Holmes was very helpful and was even able to reference cases and articles to us over the phone. While the answer we got from our Boston vet sounded more like they were guessing than actually knowing the answer.Pecan Grove and everyone there is amazing and I wouldn't go anywhere else (had I not moved across the country)~~#~1
One of the few legit brewpubs around.~~#~1
Wow... After eating sushi from across the nation i have to say Scottsdale's Geisha A Go Go has surprised me for an ultimate low. Andrew, the manager, reassured us that we had something wrong with our taste buds for not tasting how fresh the fish was here. Insulting to assume. Not recommended!!!!~~#~1
Agree with the previous review. Something nice about this super target.  Leaving a review to back up the other!!My only gripe is I spend to much at Targer. Or my wife does anyway!!!~~#~1
burger heaven! I had THE PIG Burger... it. was. delicious.  and it was served on a pretzel roll.  mmmmmmGood vibe feeling in Circle H, I like the pictures on the walls, the bar look, the entire environment was relaxed and easy going.  I came the day of the official ribbon cutting, so I got to see that happen (i had no idea those giant gold scissors were real scissors by the way.  i guess, that is a dumb though b/c what else would they be??) and it was nice to see everyone gathered for this moment.The french fires were piping hot and delicious, they have all sorts of sides like slaw, beans, mac n cheese etc.  I also had a bite of the brisket sandwich.  It was so very very good, I am ordering that next time I go back.  Local beers on tap, good price too.Great start for a new restaurant, there were of course the new hickups, but those kins get worked out with more time. Nothing to worry about.  That's how you learn!!~~#~1
We only come here for the water and in that regard there are no complaints about this place.There is no chlorine smell, faucets are all fast and the guys find your water card fast.~~#~1

The Good: -Virtually any sport you want to watch, they'll have it on one of their many TVs for you.  -Strong drinks, made correctly. Their bartenders are great.-The staff is very friendly and usually quite attentive.-Patio seating is plentiful, along with a firepit for the winter and misters for the summer.-Bouncers at the door know their stuff and will take out a crazy drunk before you even have to ask.The Bad: -The food really isn't very good. Most of it is run-of-the-mill bar food that came out of a package and tastes like crayons (bland and boring). Their garlic fries and cheese sticks are delicious though.-It can get very crowded on big game nights, and as such service can get very slow or the servers may even not be told you've been seated (the hostesses aren't great).-Sometimes at night they play the music ridiculously loud - it's a bar, not a dance club. No one goes there to sit and not hear their company.Go There For: A sports game with your friends to drink.Don't Go There For: A hearty meal with grandma after church on Sunday.~~#~0
Buffet is great, Good Selection of food even for me the picky Vegetarian. Naan tastes great, choice of plain or Garlic Naan. Food generally tastes good. Rating on Buffet alone, I would have given 4 stars.However I might not return there for Dinner or Take-out.Dinner Entries are priced well above $10,  and generally use frozen vegetables (Crinkle cut carrots anyone, god I hate those) The last time I ordered take out, the quantity of my dishes was about half of what I got the previous time. (Fine, Can I pay you a little less than the bill?) and the food tasted sub-par and my naan was burnt. For this they get only 1 star.Good place for the lunch buffet.~~#~0
3.5 if I could, but just a 3 for now.I really like the location and I hope more businesses open up downtown.  Their fish and chips are really really good.  A good portion too, enough to finish without getting painfully stuffed.  The beer list is decent as well, but pretty pricey for what they offer.  $5.50 for a pint of guiness?  I can get a six-pack for that.  Hopefully they start a good happy hour price - if so - I'll be back often.I went during the grand opening and the live music was pretty good.  They ran out of guinness at about 8pm, but got another keg within the hour so it was all good.  The beer however is extremely slow.  The waitress warned us that we'll get our food before our first beer, and she was right. My friends and I all ordered irish carbombs and the waitress had no idea what we were talking about... whaaa?  So I explained what they were and she returned 15min later.  1/2 glass of guiness in water glasses, not the pint glasses.  Was probably 1/4 pint of beer and the shots were in tall shot glasses.  So tall, that if dropped in, wouldn't pass the beer level.  So we had to pour them in.  meh...So all in all 3 stars for now.  I'll give them another shot though.~~#~0
We went today after lunch. I got my usual of lime basil and real mint chip (which I love for the real mint leaves) and my hubby got chocolate guiness and four peaks hop knot. Best ice cream in Phoenix! The staff is always super nice. They give us ice bags to take our ice cream home :-)  Love this place~~#~1
Awesome!!!~~#~1
Last week, I had my first appointment at Pure Dental. Dr. Kang and the office staff were all really nice and helpful. Dr. Kang even did my cleaning and it was very thorough. I've never had the actual dentist give me my cleaning. I was wowed by their modern equipment to view x-rays and the doctor even took pictures of my teeth to show me. I will be going back to get some filings next week and was told I could watch a movie while I was getting them done.~~#~1
Rinaldi's Italian Deli is a very good place for lunch if your in this area and looking for something a little lighter than a burger and fries.  They are conveniently located near the corner on Deer Valley and 19th ave, next to Dunkin Donuts.  They are open for breakfast, lunch and an early dinner.  I recommend going during breakfast or lunch if your interested in their "Specials of the Day" that are on their hot plates. These items don't look too appetizing if you go by in the late afternoon or evening. They offer homemade soups and fresh cut salads loaded with just about anything you could imagine.  They have a small selection of homemade pasta salads as well.  I had their pastrami on rye with their spicey, nazzle opening, and horse radishy dressing.  The pastrami was very good but had to be heated in a micro-wave. My sandwich was assembled very well so props to the girl behind the counter!  Their Italian pasta salad was excellent. Their Cob salad was also very good, nothing fancy but a good balance of veggies, bacon, egg, tomato, blue cheese, avocado with grilled chicken.Not one of the better deli's in Phoenix but loads better than any chain deli!  It's a nice alternative to burgers and fries.~~#~0
I know everyone has raved about this place. So naturally, I was was super excited to try it. I don't know if it was just so hyped up or what, but it just seemed like a normal pizza to me... with a really long wait.I was meeting some girlfriends there for lunch, we got there a few minutes early and asked to be seated, but they won't seat you until the whole party is there, unfortunately (although understandable!). So we stood outside, in the 108 degree heat until everyone got there. After waiting over an hour, they finally were able to seat us. We had three kiddos with us, and they told us they only had two high chairs. (Not a huge issue, but definitely not convenient either.)I thought their menu was extremely limited, only have 6 pizzas: 3 with red sauce and 3 with white sauce and then just a few toppings you could add.While the food was alright, I didn't find it over-the-top or spectacular as I had expected. Needless to say, I'd have no problem going back but I probably wouldn't seek it out.~~#~0
This is my first review on Yelp so here you go...I love Yasu!!  This is by far the best sushi and authentic japanese restaurant in Phoenix.  I have been there numerous times and it never disappoints.  You have to try their Sumibiyaki which are items cooked over Japanese charcoal, last time I was there I had the beef tongue..sounds weird but its so goodNigiri/sashimi are a must.  They always have the best selection and daily special, most important...its always fresh...this is definately important!!  The sweet shrimp is my personal favorite and anything else you order, you will find the fish is sliced with great execution.  Request fresh chopped wasabi, you will never eat sushi with out it again!  Love this place!!~~#~1
Went here earlier this spring and WOW - What a way to watch spring training I LOVE the Giants stadium, and this is much better. It has twice as much lawn seating, the seats are wide and comfortable AND - aimed towards home plate, which didn't used to seem like a big deal but sitting in Scottsdale down the line, IT IS. The food there is top notch, with an amazing pizza slice Plus, the ability to walk around to diff fields and watch other players work out is amazing - it sucks that the Giants keep fields separate, I think every team should do such a joint complex.~~#~1
They have the friendliest staff at this Whole Foods. They know me by name and always have samples ready for the little boy I nanny before we even walk up to the Deli counter. Maureen the checker, Kathy in vitamins, and Daniel & Paula in the Deli are all exceptional- go see them if you need anything they will be happy to help.~~#~1
I absolutely love the food here! the service is good, the food is excellent and as far as the price goes..I can't complain. this is one of favorite places to eat.~~#~1
My husband and I drove from LA to Scottsdale and almost to Scottsdale, one of our tires was going flat.  We went to Discount Tire on Shea and they checked it and found it was a cracked wheel (the tires are new).  They helped us get a new tire shipped from the east coast and put it on first thing the next morning.  They were nice, helpful, honest and affordable.  Absolutely great service!  I highly recommend them.~~#~1
We decided to meet friends here Saturday night.  Cant vouch for the drinks because I wasn't feeling well that day and decided that drinking wouldnt help things.  My wife got pretty happy with some Red Bull and vodka's, yuck, but whatever floats your boat.Wendy... well lets just say she's not going to be drinking Long Island Iced Teas for a while!  But I'm thinking they were pretty good, cuz 4 drinks pretty much says "i like these" or "i cant taste anything anymore".Music was good, dancing was hilarious and fun - as is always the case with K and C.  I would go back, I enjoyed the atmosphere... Um... minus a few wanna be porn stars LOL.... but hey, like I said, whatever floats your boat!  Good for a laugh at least!~~#~0
I moved to Phx about 6 months and since the beginning I have been hearing about Pizzeria Bianco. I also heard how freakin long you need to wait to get in. I tried it once at night and after an hour and 15 minutes I gave up. I couldn't help but wonder1. why don't they serve food outside?2. why don't they make the restaurant bigger?3. does the owner want to keep it small despite the negative experience for MANY people who have to wait for forever or just don't go because they don't want the hassle?Well, they they started serving lunch. Usually it's too far for me to run to during the work week but I happened to have a random day off and luckily I put this on my list.I was so happy to show up and see plenty of seats for me to choose from at the bar. Hallelujah, let's see what the fuss is all about. I had a tasty coke from a bottle (I'm rarely a caffeine drinker) and ordered the Margherita after debating whether to go red or white. 5 minutes after I ordered the friendly waitress told another customer at the bar that you could split the pizza and do half and half for yourself. Wish I woulda known!It took awhile to get my pizza but it was damn tasty. Maybe a 20-30 min wait tasty, but not a 4 hour wait tasty. Still good, still glad I went, still want to go again, definitely not at night, but lunch is my saving grace.~~#~0
This is by far the best and most authentic Mexican food I've had in this area of town. I try and get different dishes each time I visit and have yet to be disappointed. If you're looking for an amazing location/view/atmosphere, this probably isn't the place for you. If you're looking for amazing food, then you've come to the right place. The prices are great for what you get. The quesadillas are served on a pizza tray so bring your appetite!~~#~1
Fantastic venue! Province really adds a touch of class and elegance in a way that isn't pushy or over the top. Located in the Westin Hotel, the restaurant feels very modern! You can choose to sit inside in a beautifully decorated and spacious dining area or enjoy their fabulous patio with fireplaces and a great water feature. The food was unbelievable! I sampled their tuna and watermelon appetizer and fell in love - what an amazing combination that I'd never have thought of.If the food isn't enough, the service is superb. Every interaction with the staff was excellent - you can tell they enjoy their restaurant and are happy to be there. I cannot wait to come back to Province as soon as possible.~~#~1
I was up for a cold sugary drink before getting onto my flight so I walked over to the Wendy's next to this place. The guy at this place looked bored so I walked over to his counter to buy the drink. He was quite friendly and very prompt to charge me for the drink, which was quite a bit cheaper than the same drink at Wendy's. He also said I could either use the Coke machine or the iced tea dispensers. He had two kinds of iced tea, regular and a green blackberry. I took a little bit of the green blackberry which was very refreshing and tasted pretty good. I then went over to the Coke machine to get that. The sign on the Coke machine basically said once you buy a cup, you can refill it again and again the same day of purchase. I'll remember this if I ever have a layover in Phoenix. The prices at the Starbucks in this airport would drain my wallet fast if I had to be in the airport for any amount of time.~~#~0
I took a road trip with the fellas to watch the LA Kings beat the Phoenix Coyotes @ the Jobing.com Arena and I must say our experience at this hotel far exceeded expectations!Not only was the hotel suite very affordable when split between 4 guys (3 queen beds and 1 roll away all in 1 suite at no extra charge!), but the room was very nice, included a small refrigerator and microwave and was very comfortable!  Very new and modern and all we had to do was walk across the street to the whole Westgate Center/bars/restaurants/arena which was a HUGE plus!  At the end of a drunken debauchery filled night we stumbled back (a 5 minute walk) to our hotel safely! We were going to stay a few miles away to save money but read some reviews about the hotels having "bed bugs" and being dirty.  You won't have that problem staying here!  The room was immaculate and the staff were beyond friendly and accommodating!  That was probably the best part:  Friendly staff!  The staff literally gave off a small town feel, the only time I've ever been treated better was at a bed and breakfast!  And  the morning breakfast was another thing that made this hotel worth it.  After drinking all night and being hung over, all we needed to do was stumble down to the lobby to get some eggs, sausage, ham, toast, bagels, waffles, apple and orange juice and we were re-fueled up for some more debauchery!  They had something for everyone, including a variety of cereals and  whatever you can think of for breakfast free of charge!  So if you're planning on staying anywhere near the Westgate center/Phoenix stadium/Jobing.com arena this is the place to stay!  We will definitely be staying here again the next time I'm out in AZ for a game!~~#~1
Finally, a great place to get breakfast that isn't Denny's or iHop in Gilbert. Came here with my family and we just made it before the change in menus. The griddle bread pudding was AMAZING! Probably the highlight of the meal. We also ordered the veggie sandwich, All-American breakfast (?), a slice of red velvet cake.  We have definitely found our go-to Breakfast joint when my sister and I, both come back to Gilbert to visit the 'Rents.~~#~1
This place has negra modelo on tap.  I would almost give them 4 stars alone for that.  The food here is incredible, very reasonably priced, and is mostly locally grown and raised.  Add in there musical taste, a mixture of latin and indie rock, and you have a place about to explode from too much hipster cred.  I mean that in a good way.  We live in the east valley, so this is a haul for us, but this is THE place we take our out of town guests.  Everyone loves it.~~#~1
I took advantage of That's A Wrap for their catering services yesterday and once again, was totally impressed!  I called around 10am for a 5pm delivery... I wanted to make sure that those of us who were working at the Phoenix Art Museum all day preparing for the pARTy had some fuel to get us through the evening.  Sure enough, That's A Wrap delivered - literally and figuratively.  I ordered a platter of assorted sandwiches, fruit, chips, cookies, and bottled water - it was perfect!  Everything was delicious!  It arrived right on time and it was all labeled so it was easy to figure out what you were eating.  I had the "Godfather" wrap (Salami, ham, and provolone wrapped in a honey wheat tortilla with lettuce, tomato, red onion, sun- dried tomato mayo and a drizzle of olive oil).  I don't usually choose salami and ham but for whatever reason, this is the one that sounded best to me yesterday - and it was!Thanks That's A Wrap for fueling me and all of the yelper helpers for the pARTy... I'll be back to visit soon!~~#~1
I personally like this Fry's. I think most of the people that work there are extremely friendly. I go there once or twice a week and I'm always greeted with a smile. A few of them even ask me where I've been if I haven't been in for awhile and ask me how I'm doing. Complaing about a grocery store being crowded doesn't make sense to me since that means people like shopping there. They have no control of it being crowded. If you don't like it crowded, go across the street to Safeway where there is no one shopping there. Then you will see a difference of why Fry's is better. Why is it so busy? Because it has better deals and everyone wants to shop there. It's a positive thing. You can either deal with it being crowded once in awhile and save money or go to Safeway across the street where you will be the only shopper and get ripped off. You have options.~~#~1
love love love this place for a second i don't feel like i'm in fakville anymore.  Live music and a diverse crowd.  They make a great infused berry tea smoothie no dairy just juice and ice!  Parking is great and the selection of food is appropriate and divine for a cafe.  Very comfortable and not to image conscious inside!  Love that it's independent and staff is so lovely.  I would pay $10 for a latte just to support them!  Punch card too!~~#~1
I absolutely love this place!  I've had my birthday here twice in the last 5 years, and they have been able to accommodate large groups (up to 20s).  Their patio is super cute and great in the fall and spring time.  My favorite pizza is the Di Notte.  Cute atmosphere combined with good food = one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix.  Worth the drive to downtown!~~#~1
A hipster shindig- for day and night- make your meal with THE Burger au Poivre, Cobb Salad and best made cocktails around... One of the best places for brunch!~~#~1
I had been wanting to come back for a while.  I love this restaurant.  Last night we had a magnificent meal.  I started with the St. Francis Lemonade, a perfect cocktail to start your meal.  There are so many wonderful choices.  They are featuring a special menu for New Years, however you can order from it "a la carte", so we decided to start with the Arizona Citrus Salad.  It was delicious.  I love the combination of dates, goat cheese and orange slices.  I also chose from the special menu the sea scallops.  WOW, they were so sweet and tender.  They were served over a bed of black lentils, so amazing.  The portion was generous, 5 scallops, I am glad I didn't order the side of sweet corn polenta.  I ended up ordering dessert (yes my hubby twisted my arm, NOT).  I had the usual, Sticky Toffee Pudding and my hubby had the Chocolate Stout Cake.  I had a bite of his and it was great.  I cannot guarantee I won't stick to my usual dessert, but it was a closed one.  I wish this restaurant was closer to where I live.  It is such a great place.~~#~1
Today our travels took us to the Chandler Mall on 10/31/2012. Therefore we were near to Abuelo's for lunch. Nothing like returning to a Restaurant that you found to be very good! We arrived after 1PM, so we were seated ASAP.We ordered drinks first along with a serving of Guacamole. Nice way to start off lunch! My wife ordered the Dilla Lunch while I ordered the Grande Burrito Lunch special. Both item arrived on a very hot plate-wonderful! Whenever we are dining at another Restaurant, a hot plate is always expected but all too often the hot plate fails to appear.Our lunch stay hot until the last bite due to the hot plate service. Everything was great with the meal and no requested drink refills-always a sign of great service!Both restrooms were very clean and serviced many times during the day. We highly recommend Abuelo's for a great lunch or dinner!~~#~1
Have you ever eaten somewhere and just can't get the craving out of your head and you have to go back!  This is the place that does it to me.  I've decided I need to try everything on their menu!You have to try the Roasted Turkey and Stuffing it is to DIE for!  And the mac 'n cheese  so yummy.    I've also had the Prosciutto and Fig Jam sandwich and I thought I had died and gone to heaven.  I had that with fruit which was good.  Guess where I'm going for lunch... yeah there because I need it after doing this review.  :-)  Oh and before I forget... When the weather is nice sit out side!  You will love it.~~#~1
Decent bar food with all the servers dressed in Alice Cooper attire.  I am being open-minded and starting this thing off with 5 stars.  Minus one star for being a bit overpriced on the appetizer end.  I ordered onion rings at $8 per order.  Seriously, are 15 onion rings worth $8? Minus one star for not having any parking.  You have to park a couple of blocks away in the ghetto area to find a spot.  You will have 2-3 beggars asking you for change to and from your car.  There was a dude who wanted to wash my windows for money.  Minus half a star for putting the gratuity on the bill and charging for it.  I hate that crap.  Plus half a star for the waitresses who are dressed heavy metal-like wearing mid-riffs with the tramp stamp.  I always wanted to date chicks like that, but was ummm...to busy with umm....other chicks chasing me down.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, and I just umm...you know, didnt have time for them at that point in my life.  I better stop my review now.~~#~0
You can get a 3 course meal here for lunch for under $20.  Most entrees are in the mid teens and include appetizer/salad or soup, entree, and dessert.  A selection of bread and butter is available for you to snack on as well.  Comparing the other culinary restaurants I've eaten at, I'd say this one serves OK food, but the others are better in preparation and taste.  I had the salmon and ravioli appetizer, which tasted OK, albeit too salty due to the salt crust on the salmon, and the ravioli innards leaked out of the pasta into the bowl it was served in, making it look less appetizing.  The entree itself was (poisson rouge) tasted good and was well prepared, but the dessert (black forest cake) mousse was too runny.  Service from our main waitress was good.  Our water server was probably the most awkward server I've encountered, and he forgot to bring out some items I requested but hey, I give him points for trying.  One thing that was weird was that one of the instructors came over and made a snide remark on how I wanted bread for my dessert because I was trying to finish the last piece of bread on the table (I hate wasting food).~~#~0
So, going on Christmas, always a risk. There was a wait and 2 parties in front of my group left. There we people waiting for their pick up order for over 20 minutes. But when we asked how long it would be until we got sat and would have our food we were told 15 minutes. He was true to his word on that.  The food was good. The egg rolls were awesome. We didn't really have a waiter tending to us, but that was ok. the bus person got us more water when we asked. I would probably go here again if I was in the area, but I would just as soon have the Panda.~~#~0
The best tacos in the city, amazing veggies, and indescribably great salsas. The tacos are like tapas, so you need to order two or three, but they are reasonably priced. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff with great art to view while waiting for your order.~~#~1
I love this place! Great place to grab a quick smoothie or stay to hang out! (just let them know if you're in a  hurry)P.S. The phone number is area code 480 not 490 :)~~#~1
The first time I went to YC's was in scottsdale. I loved how you choose what you like in your bowl and sauces. they cook it up right in front of you. you can stuff your bowl as much as you can. don't worry about getting alot because all you pay for a take out box is 50 cents. it is great for leftovers, the food tastes fresh still. The one in tempe was awesome as well. I love this place. I had one larg bowl, a bowl of rice, chicken soup, and a soda for $10.25 how can you go wrong with that???~~#~1
Just go eat here. Get the cheese curds, I think they may be developing CCA (cheese curd anonymous) soon, but until it becomes a diagnosable disease I will continue to indulge.Oh yah, the Pine Steak, is also fantastic and will probably also cause addictive like tendencies. Oh, oh, oh...  the chicken and waffles are also a pleasant surprise in the other wise repetitive and ordinary dining scene that is so often found in Phoenix. Just do yourself a favor and go check this place out. And try the home made ginger ale, tonic or lemonade by them selves... or mix it up with one of their top shelve spirits.~~#~1
When I moved to the Valley, our first place was a rental in Old Town.  The previous tenant/owner generously left a bunch of take-out menus for nearby restaurants.  Defalco's was one of them.  But not being a fan of the sandwich, it took me four years and a move to actually go in.  What a fool I was.  This place is fantastic!  First off, it's not just a deli, it's an Italian market.  Had I actually read the full name of the place, I might have known that.  It's also got a somewhat extensive selection of wine available for purchase.  So now we've moved from a deli, to a grocer, to a wine shop.  Don't forget the pasta dishes and the pastry, too.  My fave sandwich is the tomato, mozz, and basil on a sub roll with olive oil and balsamic.  Simple, yet perfection.  I'm a huge fan of those sub rolls by the way.  Crusty on the outside, but not so crusty that it makes a big mess every time you take a bite, yet soft and chewy on the inside.  It's always about the bread for me.  Great selection of prepared salads in the deli as well.  One of the best red potato salads I've had in a long time.It certainly won't take me another four years to go back.  I think I've been there just about every week in the last month!~~#~1
Yes, I'm a vegetarian reviewing a steakhouse, though I have eaten their steaks pre-veg. Their spinach salad is very good and filled with goodies such as goat cheese, dried cranberries, pecans, and mandarin oranges and is only a measly $6. I ordered the trio of sides which included some mushrooms, steamed asparagus and sweet potato fries. Our service was great, which typically it always is at The Keg. Big beers, nice sides, and for the meat eaters great steaks. Steakhouses should just offer a big ass portobello mushroom for vegs.~~#~0
Yo, this is my favorite AJ's here. If you gots a beef with the prices then go somewhere else. Actually, the prices aren't any higher than Safeway, they just carry better, and more expensive for them to buy, products. They have been great to me as far as ordering Rambutans when I have a whim or a craving. The sandwich counter is awesome, and I love the slices of pizza that are as big as my head. The drink counter is stellar and they brew China Mist iced teas. Every once in a while the Prickly Pear flavor comes up and I'm so so so happy. This store is much larger than the Scottsdale/Lincoln location, and the service here is friendlier than that location as well. Shot out to Gerri at the floral counter, she is teriffic, as well as the produce manager who takes care of me every time. You guys rock!~~#~1
Stopped by to see what's new after the summer reopen.  New merchandising is really cool with the mixed textures with the textiles,  Some really great stuff and pretty good prices.  I've been in this store numerous times and though I like to be left alone to wander, when I do make - or try to make a purchase the owner and her staff are borderline rude.  There are many other great places where the staff is welcoming and anxious to help.  I've decided not to include this store on my regular rounds.~~#~0
Camus is a cute little trendy bar/restaurant located in the Clarendon hotel.  I came here for a business lunch awhile ago and really enjoyed it.  We were one of two tables though, so service was top notch.  Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and was able to answer any and all questions we had.The chef even came out to say a hello, which I found to be impressive.  The calamari app was excellent and my dish of mushroom gnocchi was amazing. I definitely recommend this place!~~#~1
Great service~~#~1
Looking a cutting edge, wanting the best for everyone type of pet boutique you must go to Oliver and Annie's. Chris, the owner is amazing! He knows his stuff and has the best of the best. There is no pet boutique like his. Urban chic and healthy top draw. He is an amazing supporter of local artists and designers and an absolute delight to know and do business with. His loving nature is endearing! It's no surprise he just received the "Best of Phoenix" award.~~#~1
Have you ever tried the chicken rotisserie here? They go fast so you have to be lucky to get one unless you call ahead. Its not so much about the rotisserie chicken as it is about the amazing and creamy and smooth and exceptionally well balanced Garlic Sauce/spread they give you that goes along with the chicken. Have I told you how amazing this spread is. If only I knew the recipe...I would eat it by the tub...okay maybe by the spoonfuls. Anyway...try the chicken rotisserie or the chicken taook. Heck if you don't want to eat either of those things...just ask for some garlic sauce on the side with whatever you are eating. You will not be disappointed.~~#~1
I was thrilled to find my room huge, sheets crisp and clean, and the staff super friendly.~~#~1
I dined in Sol this past week and was amazed. I am in the industry and have absolutely fell in love with this place. The food is not only original but good an healthy. I will say this though if you are looking for refried beans and mush on your plate this is not the mexican food for you. It reminded me of time i have spent down the coast of mexico, very wonderful. I can see them still working out a few errors but they are very quick to fix any mistake. the service i had was absolutely amazing, it was nice to see someone like the tall good looking gentlemen i had wait on me. he was funny and kept my table laughing and very informative overall, i really had a sense during my meal he wanted nothing but the best for my table. definitely somewhere i will be back too for sure, especially since im craving that taco vampiro again.~~#~1
Came here last Saturday to see what it was all about but I really wish I had come on Friday instead.. The crowd was a little strange and consisted of mostly older people.. They played a mix of top 40s and hip hop whereas on Friday nights it's mainly hip hop.. The drinks run about $7-10 a piece and the bartender that helped me was very friendly! She even offered my friend and I a free shot.. The music wasn't very consistent so there weren't too many people on the dancefloor unless it was a hip hop song playing, so I spent most of my time sitting in their outdoor patio.. I love the decor and the ambiance but I really wasn't feelin the scene on Saturday.. I'm gonna have to return sometime on a Friday night to see how that goes..~~#~0
There is nothing special about this place to speak of, hardly a place I'd seek out to go to again. It's in the heart of Old Town, but doesn't feel Scottsdalian at all. I guess it's an OK place to hang out, they have a patio and a cozy interior, (like TT Roadhouse's decor but bigger, and not as cool)  I thought the choice of beer was lacking, the service slow and obnoxious. I fell like I was bothering the bartender by ordering drinks. I really haven't had that experience too often in Phoenix, in Boston every bartender is annoyed to serve you, so I am used to it, but this is Phoenix damn it!  One guy in particular just stood behind the bar with his arms folded, I am not sure of his "role" in the whole bar tending process. He didn't even pick up a glass, just stood in defiance of the customers. Overall, this place is decent, but I wouldn't choose to go again, I met some friends here and we proceeded to go elsewhere after.It seems as if the Coach House is meant to be a place you meet up have a drink, then bounce to someplace else. I kept wondering, where are all the fine leather couches, and handbags...LOL! ;)~~#~0
Here's how to do Pizzeria Bianco the right way:1. Show up at 3:30 or earlier to get a good place in line. Make sure you bring some friends to enjoy the time together and the great food.2. At 4:00, the bar opens. Get yourself a bottle of wine and make the best of the 90 minutes you'll spend just waiting to get on the seating list.3. Order a few appetizers from the bar; they're light and fresh and yummy.4. When you finally get seated for dinner, don't hold back. Order salads, share different pizzas, and have a coffee after.The quality of the food is ABSOLUTELY worth the wait. We tried eating here a few times over the past couple of years, but realized it takes commitment and two bottles of wine to make it through the line. Best pizza I've had since Italy. Bravo Bianco!~~#~1
Now that I have tried all the main bubble tea/boba places in the Valley, I can say that this place is the best and most consistent. It therefore deserves five stars!~~#~1
We were so disappointed!  We were on vacation in Scottsdale and wanted to try a Brazilian restaurant.  It was nothing like the one we have had home.  Actually it was completely worse than all three Brazilian steakhouses we have close to home.  I tried about 12 different meats and I think there were only 2 out of the 12 that were tender.  The rest were over cooked or hard as a rock.  We really wanted to love this place as I kept trying more and more of the meats as they came around hoping the next one would be better.  Besides being hard, the meats didn't have much flavor.  The salad bar was okay and I don't know that I would even pay the cheaper price to just eat from their salad bar.  This is sad that I have to say the highlight or our meal was the fresh bread and salami slice you get at the salad bar.  :(~~#~1
Changs has a good menu but this location still needs to work on their service.  Each time I have been unimpressed by the consistency of service.  Also, when refilling water, please do not slosh it everywhere.  I know you are in a hurry, but points for style are awarded for not slopping water on the table, floor, and customers...(aka my guests).  Gets pretty noisy so I recommend getting there before the dinner crowd for a conversational meal.~~#~0
If its good enough for Britney, its good enough for me.  Which I guess isnt saying much these days...  But trashy ole Brit knew what she was doing when she booked a room at Sanctuary.  This resort truely is a Sanctuary--the pool, complete with negative edge, in-water matching rafts for guests, and a top notch waitstaff was my favorite spot.  Had a gotten a chance to experience the spa, which I've heard is one of the best in town, I may have taken up residence there.I stayed here as a reward for work with a bunch of girls--we had a suite--a sweet suit eactually, complete with 3 bedrooms, kitchen living room, etc.  We even had a cute bellboy who watched parts of the NBA finals with us.  Now thats service.  Plush robes, a balcony with a perfect mountain view, and egyptian cotton sheets.  Loveitloveit.At night we went to Elements which is the very up-scale restaurant and bar at the resort.  It deserves its own review so I'll write a seperate one, but know that its exceptional and the view is amazing.  A great date spot for even those who aren't spending the night at the hotel.~~#~1
gotta be honest, i'm not a wine drinker, but came here to meet up with friends for a tasting. the space is sleek, yet cozy. the staff is friendly and very earnest and knowledgable in their wine presentation.~~#~1
This is one of my favorite breakfast restaurants! They carry the best bran muffin I've ever had....it has a delicious brown sugar topping on it. I love coming here on special occasions!~~#~1
beware of the hidden  65 cent surcharge per person for tea even if you don't drink tea?  really.The crazy thing is, i'm sure no one even notices the extra cost because who checks the bill?When I mentioned it to the cashier, she was stuttering and stammering and started to back pedal and said  "oh, is this your 1st time?  we can remove it from the bill"I said forget it, keep it.i usually tip 20-30% but i'll just let them keep their meager 65 per charge.  yeah, really worth losing a customer for?my 4 year old daughter even gets the gratuitus tea party charge and she only drinks water.gone are the $2.15 per item flat rate (can you say bait and switch?)$2.35 PER so now they're no different from the rest of the dim sum places.as sneaky as C-FOO trying to strong arm the 15% gratuity (which failed miserably and lost us and about 100 of our friends as customers)so in a down economy, you're supposed to raise your prices and sneak in stealthy surcharges?it's the chinese way i guessback to china king for us.  sorry china king for being disloyal with having a brief and sordid affair with the palace.will you forgive us? haha~~#~1
Updating my review after several weeks. Appears maybe the managers read these reviews. In the last few weeks this store has improved 2 stars. The eggs in my BBs have been cooked perfectly, Diet Coke tastes better and they have not forgotten anything in all my visits. Added two stars because they have been consistently 5 stars since my last review...but I am still watching.~~#~1
This is a true gem! I took my dog there after bouncing around trying to find the right groomer for him. I read the reviews and gave this place a try. I was really happy with the customer service, the service performed on my dog, the fact I got a same day appt, and most importantly....my dog did not seem to be anxious or uncomfortable. He normally leaves a groomer stressed and not himself, but he seemed to be at complete ease here!~~#~1
We had looked to buy a unit here & looked at several units, then decided to rent for a while first.  We've been here almost a year & loved it at first, but have had horrible noise problems for about 8 months & management won't do a thing about it.   The walls here are paper-thin & we our neighbor plays her music loudly at 3am almost every night.  It's so loud that we had to move our bed to the other side of the room and run a humidifier all night just to try to block the noise, but that doesn't work.  We've called security several times, but it never seems to help.  The ceilings are also very thin & you can easiy hear any walking above you.   Aesthetically this place looks great.  The gym is great too, but the construction is horrible.~~#~1
Both of my girls have been enrolled in Marilyn's studio and it has been a wonderful experience for our family.  The teachers are engaging and creative and as a result both of my girls love to dance and my eldest daughter who is now 11 has been dancing with them since the age of 3.  No stage moms here, but rather a warm, friendly environment where girls can develop their dance abilities free from the high pressure nature of some studios.  Our family looks forward to many more recitals to come.  Thanks Marilyn Bostic Ballet Centre for helping develop our daughters' confidence and love for dance!~~#~1
I live down the street from Casey Moore's. I have been here a total of three times. The first time a group of us just ordered drinks, and the margaritas my friend and I ordered were so terrible that we sent them back. The second time I went with my husband and ordered a crab salad sandwich. Again, it was so awful I had to send it back. I am not a picky eater, nor have I been known to complain about food or service when dining out. There has only been one other restaurant I have ever been to where I sent food back. So, this place was already two for two. Alas, my husband begged me to go back once more. He was craving oysters and since this is an oyster house, I figured it wouldn't hurt to give them one more shot. It was last Thursday evening, and the place was hoppin'. This time, the food was decent. Not good, but decent enough where I may have given Casey Moore's a fourth chance had I been impressed with the service. But the service was HORRIBLE. Our waitress got us our drinks and didn't come back to take our orders for another 20 minutes. We sat there awkwardly waiting for her to stop by, and though she passed us quickly several times, she never even acknowledged us with a simple "I'll be back with your orders." When she did arrive 20 minutes later, she asked if we were ready to order without even an apology. I am not kidding you when I say she acted like she wanted nothing to do with us. She was very monotone and never smiled with us. I would like to pass this off as her having a bad night, but when she went to her other tables (all full of men with drinks) she suddenly lit up, laughed, and had a blast with them. It was so awkward to the point that my husband asked if maybe we knew her and had upset her in some way in the past. But no. This was our first time meeting her. We were pleasant customers who didn't complain about the mediocre food or slow service. We were polite and left a good tip. We pride ourselves on being fun, engaging, and polite with our servers since we go out often. But let me tell you right now what makes me the most angry. We live so damn close to this place and would have loved to be regulars... It is such a shame that Casey Moore's has now given us three good reasons to never come back. And I can't find any information on their website of how to contact the manager about this, so I am left to rant here on Yelp, completely unsatisfied. Sigh...~~#~1
Chai is alive and well, and living at City Center at City North.I had been dating a gal name Starbucks for the past few years. She was a plain gal, generic if you will.  She was dependable and available. I was feeling as if i needed more out of my relationship, as you can imagine. So, at times, I would cheat on my gal with another gal named Coffee Bean. Coffee Bean was Kosher and a bit edgier, yet had a leaner list of qualities. I needed more out of my relationships. They say that when you're not looking for someone new, they appear. Well, that was the case with my new crush named Press. I had been to High Street for dinner Kona Grill, yet most of the other shops and restaurants were closed or not yet open for business at the time. I ventured back during daytime hours to give them another opportunity.  I had heard about Press, so I was more than excited to give it a go. At this point I was still making caffeine a part of my diet, so i ordered something called a "Dirty Chai." This was a Chai with espresso shots. Press uses a powdered Chai which, in my opinion, works better than the liquid or tea bag forms. I was also given the option to have my frothy delight in a ceramic cup.  I opted for that.  I felt like i was having the type of coffee house experience I had only just imagined. Press occupies a well appointed space, too.  From the wood and granite, to the stained concrete floors, I felt as if i were in a European city, not a Phoenix strip mall. The free wi-fi is a major plus, in my opinion. Press goes as far as to have a "dog friendly" cart outside, in its ample outdoor seating area. I spoke with Steve, the owner of Press, at length.  In talking, I asked how Press came to be, and he said that his wife had wanted to open a coffee shop one day.  Well Steve, you have certainly exceeded her expectations, as well as the residents of the Greater Phoenix area. By the way, Press serves sandwiches and soups, as well as an extensive list of wines. Check it out, the staff will make you feel at home, or like you're on vacation in the cozy European city of your choice.~~#~1
I am a huge tea drinker, so when I found out about Teavana I was excited.  I entered the store and an employee asked if I cared to try some tea. After sampling several different blends, I chose three to purchase.  The employee asked if I wanted to get a large canister for a dollar more than the one I had picked. Not realizing this store sells tea by the ounce rather than per canister, I said "sure." He chatted as he filled the containers, never mentioning the price, and once done took my debit card and rang me up. I didn't pay attention to the cost and when I looked at the receipt when I got home my heart nearly stopped. I spent $350 on tea. I returned it and they didn't give me too much trouble. Now I always check the total before handing my card over, and I won't go back. I feel like they totally swindled me.~~#~1
Umm is it possible to give MORE than 5 stars!??! My girlfriend believes, Duane is AMAZING, and hands DOWN the best handyman ever. We stumbled upon him and had him come to the house to fix a ceiling fan that had fallen out of the ceiling completely. Yikes... His charge was reasonable for coming by about $40ish and he really goes above and beyond especially with quality and letting you know the facts. This was a house full of girls and often times when they are clueless they try to pull a fast one, NOPE, not Duane. He is honest, and very caring. When he was leaving he noticed the door had a stick to it and brought back something from his vehicle and fixed it for free!Most recently, my girlfriend called him at nearly 9pm to tell him her disposal stopped working. He immediately remembered her as the house with the three dental students and exactly where she lived (even though he had last been there a year ago) and walked her through how to fix it over the phone, for free. This guy really is the epitome of what everyone wants and needs in a handyman! Call him for ANY home issue you may need help with!~~#~1
I walked here in the heat and was immediately greeted with an ice cold beer. For free! It was a delicious IPA and the staff couldn't have been friendlier. There were even snacks. I also had another sample of their Camelback ale. Both were heaping samples, almost a full cup. The tour was fun and informative. The co owner George even gave me and my boyfriend a ride to the lightrail stop!! We didn't bring our bikes. So awesome.  Definitely recommend. Lovely way to spend a Saturday afternoon.~~#~1
One of my favorite places to take my 3 and 4 year old. Only drawback is it gets really crowded- especially with the school groups so we call early to see how many school groups there are and then we decide if its worth it or not. They sometimes host 500 kids at this museum and thats just not fun. Other than that this place is amazing.~~#~1
I have stopped into Copper Star on previous occasions, during street festivals, but today was the first time I came to sit and study. Man, am I a fan of this place. I am lucky that I live in a location where I have a multitude of options (Lux, Lola, Hob Nobs, SBUX, etc) but I have to say I really liked the vibe here. The music wasn't loud, the people relatively quiet and chill, and I could actually focus on what I was doing without getting too distracted by everything around me. I liked that while on a busy street (7th Ave), the entrance and windows actually face the side street it is on. That added to the peace and quiet of it. Employees were nice, free wi-fi (internet key is needed but on a sign in the shop), and I enjoyed my small, mint mocha with a chocolate chip cookie (both just under $7). I was definitely eyeing the cupcakes in the bakery window but my tummy only had enough room for a cookie (which was soooo good if I might say). They are open until 9pm on Sundays which is pretty cool. I have yet to use their drive through for coffee, but they are open pretty early which is nice competition to SBUX. There is also outdoor seating which will be so nice when it starts to cool off....you can give your dog a bath at Wag-n-Wash next door and then sit outside with them while you enjoy some local coffee.~~#~1
Makes the job of shipping packages a lot less miserable.I can purchase any supplies needed, heck--they will even fill out the forms!I come bring all my packages here, ship them whatever method I want and get it all done without stressing.While I hate dealing with shipping things... this place makes it even a bit fun with their service with a smile and fun conversation added in.~~#~1
We came here for dinner for me and reverse happy hour for my wife, we ordered our appetizers and after finishing them and looking over the menu for a few minutes we were ready to jump into the overpriced entrees. We were then informed that we couldn't order dinner. Maybe when they see someone coming in and telling them they are...here for dinner...they might give them a heads up that the kitchen Is closing so we can order our meals and not be told five minutes after it did close..fourth time we've given this place a and got crappy service. Bartender got a buck tip and we had to go find another restaurant for dinner, Needless to say we won't be giving them another chance. Not good Gordon B. Not good.~~#~1
I came in for a gift for my boyfriend's pleasure.  The lady working there answered my questions thoroughly and professionally.  Any shyness or awkwardness I might have felt disappeared.  I was prepared to spend more for a different product but was steered to a better choice by this lady.  Turns out, my boyfriend was very happy with his gift.  This was around Halloween so there were a lot more items than usual like costumes, pasties... fun things.  I can wholeheartedly recommend this Fascinations!~~#~1
Yes, this place can be a bit pricey, however if you catch them at happy hour or on "girls night out" it can be very affordable. The atmosphere and the "specialness" of the melting pot is unbeatable. I have been there for intimate occasions, and family birthdays. Food is wonder, especially the cheese! The menu has changed a bit over the years, and there are some oldies I would love to see return (the mushroom salad), but there is nothing that beats this place for any special occasion~~#~1
I ordered the gyro.THE GOOD:1. Well spiced gyro meats, but a tad too greasy for my tastes. You also get a reasonable portion, which is always appreciated.2. The pita bread was rather tasty as well. Slightly chewy, though.3. Not too expensive.4. Friendly owners.THE BAD:1. A little piece of tomato and a few paper-thin pieces of onions. If you love onions in your gyro, ask for some extra onions on the side.2. Again, it's a bit greasy. Even for a gyro.THE SO-SO:1. The tzatziki isn't that flavorful, but I enjoy a definite garlicky presence to my tzatzik'. It was decent, but afterwards I wasn't lapping up every last bit from the little plastic container like a hungry dog.All in all, I'll probably return if I'm in the area and crave a gyro.~~#~0
A must for us when we visit Scottsdale.  Whole family finds what they like and the burgers are fantastic. Very well priced and easy to bring the family, have some wings, burgers a few beers and not break the piggy bank.~~#~1
Love this place! I think this is probably the best Chinese buffet out here! They serve quality gourmet food. And they have a full bar too. Place is clean and service is great. Would go back anytime!~~#~1
Great service, good beer, AMAZING burger and yummy sweet potato fries.  This place is an awesome bar food venue with a cool interior design, not too pricey or pretentious.~~#~1
I can't believe I haven't yelped about the place yet. Several months (maybe over a year?) ago my husband read a newspaper article about the Clover coffee maker and the one place in town that had managed to procure one. I was skeptical (as is my nature). It can't be that much better right? You're just saying it's amazing because you want to talk about the new hot coffee shop you discovered, right? Well, maybe. But I love this place. And I don't think it has a whole lot to do with the Clover. They roast their own beans and they roast them way differently than that other ginormous coffee chain - all a light or medium roast. Never bitter, never oily, never yucky. The coffee they make there is, obviously, the best. But I send my husband in every week now to buy a pound of beans so that I can approximate the same coffee at home. Add an edgy (though sometimes intimidating) seating area, great local art (which we bought off the wall), and smiley service...I'm sold. Can't wait to try out the downtown location.~~#~1
Heard about this restaurant from a friend and I was amaze by the food and their friendly service. I tried the chicken adobo and it was amazing! The chicken came apart with no effort and it had a great honey glazed taste. The portions were a good amount for their low prices. I couldn't  get enough of their amazing dessert!~~#~1
Had to update because we've now tried the pizza! For all the times we have visited we've never tried a pizza (too many other really good options to choose I guess...)We ordered the Italian Classic (veggies & meat). We ordered it a little well done/crispy and were not disappointed! It was hot, fresh and cooked perfectly! Service was great as usual even though they were completely SLAMMED with customers the day before Thanksgiving filing numerous growlers of their pumpkin beer which sold out in less than record time!We were there again last weekend for the football games and made it in time to order our favorite breakfast items - eggs benedict and the braised pork dish with beans, potatoes, two eggs and fresh warm tortillas.  It was fantastic! This dish, just like many others (possibly ALL others) is plenty for 2 to share. Service was exceptional and the crowd fun and rowdy rooting for their teams and AZ won - so there were a lot of happy customers that day!~~#~1
A big shout out to Mike, the stupendously stellar bar manager.  I will be back to discuss the history of Vodka.Thank you to restaurant GM, Anibal, who stopped by to see us not once, but twice.  Enjoyed the education regarding the secretive life of truffles. Aaron, the fantastically knowledgeable Sommelier, had me paired with excellent wine suggestions with only a few hints of my picky palette.  Appreciated the Manger of Stone Rose, Sam,  coming all the way over from the other side to dropped in and sat with us to chat about upcoming events.Can't wait to go back to try out there new bar bite menu in 2 weeks, and take advantage of the locals' secret  1/2 off bottle night on Tuesdays from there amazingly huge book of wines to choose from.  Thanks again everyone: you made a potentially disastrous date night from visiting an establishment previous which (to say the least) did not go well, into a very enjoyable and fun evening.~~#~1
Disclaimer: I am a Thai person and a Thai food connoisseur. This is supremely average Thai food and overpriced as heck to take advantage of White People. Sorry to be blunt but that's all it is. $18 dishes that are $8 at a real Thai restaurant. The spring rolls were very bland and came with only a tiny bit of sauce for dipping. They should also include on the table a selection of fish sauces and spices to add to your meals and appetizers. They dont have.If you like spicy, skip it for sure. Again this is what we would call Tourist Thai back in Thailand. Tiny servings.The good. Friendly wait staff.If authentic Thai is what you're looking for try any of these: Palees Crown, Tum Nak Thai or Royal Thai Grill.~~#~1
I'm very new to PHX. I ended up talking to a cop at the airport who told me about Thursday Rockabilly nights at the Blooze. I had to check it out. My friend and I walked in and were instantly comfortable, excited, and impressed. The AC was pumping, beer was cold, the music; rockin, and the crowd; refreshing. The bathroom was great! They don't have food there but they will let you bring in whatever you want. We went there pretty early, around 7:30ish. Unfortunately, because of ridiculously early work on Fri AM, I had to leave once it was starting to get really packed and lively around 10:30/11. I am so glad that I finally checked the place out though. I will definitely frequent The Blooze as often as I can.~~#~1
Finally, well-qualified, well-established mechanics that don't talk to me like I'm a dumb, car-ignorant girl - even if I am. I was sitting at a desk establishing an estimate for my Honda within 20 minutes of calling them. The receptionist was polite and efficient, but truly the best part was their interactive, transparent estimate process. I was able to view the screen as my estimator drag and dropped the parts he suspected I would need into a spreadsheet. Then, I saw him calculate the labor hours - something I had NEVER been privy to before. Tracy's Auto Body was affordable, very quick and went above and beyond - alerting me to other pieces that were loose and fixing them for free. I highly recommended their services. They have a perfect record since the mid-1980s with BBB and with good reason.~~#~1
So I was like a lemming trying this after Man vs Food when recently visiting Phoenix.  But......  the kid is right.... everything on the Del Rey torta works together.  And it is HUGE.  And it's great too.  Wonderfully constructed, just enough of everything and not too much of anything.  I also had the watermelon juice (interesting, huh)?  One strange thing.... first Mexican restaurant I've ever been in that didn't have chips and salsa.  Only real downside is that the service is a bit slow.  But they're slammed and deservedly so.~~#~1
are you joking? Where else can you get the best salami, ham, any cold cuts anywhere? I just moved here 6 months ago and have been searching for a place like this. Their meats are fantastic. I discovered this place after driving by it so many times. thought I'd take a chance. Location is awful. but worth the trip.~~#~1
Excellent place.  I have eaten here several times and the place is always busy.  The sushi is good and you can order things that are not on the menu if you know what you want.  I have a friend who works for Intel with a lot of Asians and they frequent this place a lot, which is how I came to discover this place. The prices are good and are much cheaper than the RA or Kona when you take into account how big the portions are.~~#~1
TJ was there for me when my water heater broke and started flooding my garage.  He walked me through fixing it over the phone until he was able to send some help to my house.  Very grateful, and I will continue referring!~~#~1
We had fun but it is definately more for kids 5 and younger . The pretend store was fun and we all had a blast playing in the noodles.~~#~0
"Gosh-Awful-Gooey Banana Split: fresh banana split lengthwise, Turkish coffee ice cream blanketed with caramel sauce, red raspberry sorbet smothered in marshmallow sauce with delicious whip and a juicy maraschino cherry atop." Heaven!!~~#~1
"Wait, we're in Arizona?"" No seriously, this is Arizona?"I had to keep blinking cause I could've sworn we were still in the East Bay last Friday night as we waited for our faux meat meals to arrive at our table. My hubster and I were visiting his mom for the first time since she had moved to Phoenix and admittedly, neither of us were too stoked on the visit. We totally wanted to see her but as for Phoenix?? Anyways... she knew what she was doing by taking us straight from the airport to Green. I LOVED EVERYTHING. From our appetizers (hummus + fries) to my entree- I had the chicken curry noodle bowl, to my beverage- a suicide mixture of their house green tea and house limeade (YUM) to my soy ice cream treat (I had the mint with paul newman oreos!) which I scarfed down after being totally stuffed. This place is ridiculously good. And reasonably priced. And fresh. And not stuffy or pretentious in anyway. Basically, this would be our new steady if we lived anywhere near... Tempe. Which fortunately we do not, but I have to say, you Arizonians sure are stoked to have a place like Green.And now we have a reason to look forward to returning to AZ!! :D~~#~1
My six year old daughter and I enjoyed a fun and memorable date night at Melting Pot last night. It was her first exposure to fondue and we had a blast eating great food and talking about her first three days of first grade. We starteed with a fantastic spinach and artichoke fontina & butterkäse cheese fondue, then shared the "Land & Sea" (filet mignon, chicken and shrimp). Of course, when the dessert menu came out so did a bit more enthusiasm. She had never dreamed of seeing a pot of melted chocolate before. The looks on her face were priceless. She chose the "Cookies 'n Cream Marshmallow Dream" and it was crazy good. I'm looking forward to taking the whole family and to making this a more common stop on our date night calendar.~~#~1
Have eaten here several times.  Always amazing.~~#~1
Love the buffet, the folks that work there are great, we usually hit this at least once a weekend and our table is always ready and he knows what sort of naan we want. Small but worth it.~~#~1
Great selection of gelato! Friendly welcoming staff. Reasonably priced, deliciously rich gelato!~~#~1
The BEST brewery I've ever been to. Amazing beer and awesome food (I didn't think that combo was actually possible)! I daydream about this place all the time since I spent so much time here while going to school at ASU. Whenever I go back to Phoenix, this is always a must on my list!~~#~1
Bonkers staff at this small breakfast joints ... One totally overbearing and the other over the top nice but both in a frantic, hyped up on caffine kind of way. Still there was a huge line at the Breakfast Club so we gave The Dose a try. The eggs over easy were broken and our server was confused at the request to have eggs on top of my toast. Turkey sausages were ok and the breakfast potatoes were excellent. So for a regular breakfast it was meh but then I ordered one single buttermilk pancake ... WOW! Perhaps the best pancake I have had in the valley!For a regular b'fast show me to the 5&Diner but for pancakes only I would certainly go back.~~#~0
I have been here countless times since my last review and found myself here for a quick drink and some appetizers last night.  I took a huge hiatus as I was in Michigan for a month and then have been crazy busy since arriving back in Phoenix and transitioning into a new job- I was sad because I thought they would've forgotten me.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that they did not forget me at all.  I love that!We grabbed some brews and shared the patatas bravas (a personal favorite) and the mushroom appetizer.  The mushroom appetizer was heavy on the cheese but still a tasty bite.  The patatas bravas really never fail- they remind me of my Mom's version of french fries.  I'd highly recommend this place for a date- it seems to pay off in more ways than one.  Always great service and interesting eats- still lovin' Tuck Shop for being in my neighborhood!~~#~1
Was not expecting such a wonderful meal in a shopping center! After some shopping my husband and I were starving.....this was the first place we stumbled upon that was still serving their lunch menu at 3:30pm. For starters we tried the calamari....delicious....lovely deep fried lemon and zucchini pieces amongst the calamari pieces.For mains we both tried the tomato and basil soup....very tasty. The veal meatball that my husband had and that I had to sample was also very good....smothered in a nice tangy, rich sauce. My vegetarian pizza was the best one I have had in years....super fresh ingredients on a very tasty base.For dessert the gelato profiteroles smothered in chocolate sauce were simply devine!Needless to say we loved this place not just due to the amazing food but also the atmosphere (may be in a shopping area but still nice and cozy) and the great staff who were very friendly.Will probably dine here every shopping trip : )~~#~1
Went back with some veggie friends of mine and wasn't disappointed.  One of them ordered the regular flour quesadilla, and they loved it.  It had veggie stuff on the inside and I tasted a bite which was delicious.  I will probably order this next time I go.  Also, the grilled onion which came on the side was a big hit.  The other friend ordered the mushroom corn quesadilla.  She liked it but didn't love it.  I had the shrimp tacos and, wow, were they good.  I don't know why, with all the tortas on the menu, but I just seem to prefer the other menu items.  As always, the service was great, and it was very, very busy.  We had to wait to be seated.  Love this place!~~#~1
Okay.. I loved this place so much when I visited last year that I planned my Besties' birthday bash here in August this year. I flew in specifically for this event. There were 10 of us at 8pm. Called to put our name on the list a few hours before as instructed. They were so unorganized it was horrible. We didnt get seated until about 10 pm and by then 2 people had left because they were starving.. By the time we were seated our service finally came together and I have to say we LOVED the unique shots and had almost every one on the menu. As for the food. The Hamachi Popper was by far my favorite. The HUGE disappointment other than the horrible service in the first 2 hours, was the elimination of the PB & Jelly roll. It was the ENTIRE reason I chose this place and they no longer have it! WTF? Had I not had 10 shots I would have been furious. Management was gracious enough to take off a couple shots from our bill for the chaos we had endured. It was appreciated. All in all we had a good time even though it took  forever to get to that point.~~#~0
How have I not reviewed this place on Yelp?I reviewed them for Check Please, Arizona!, a PBS review show. http://www.azpbs.org/checkplease/. I could at least do a written review. I've eaten at FEZ so many times, I can't count anymore. I think their burgers are some of the best I've ever had in the valley. Always juicy, I think the square patties are adorable. The FEZ burger, with it's molasses bbq, cinnamon pears, feta, providing fireworks for the tounge. Their Douxelle burger, with sauteed mushrooms, provolone cheese &  mustard, resulting in a subdued but delicious burger. Their fries, which include normal, sweet potato, harissa, & garlic are also great, but I love the salad that comes default, including their lemon dressing. If burgers & fries aren't your thing, they have Kisras( think like pizza, minus the cheese), and their daily specials are amazing. One time, I was lucky enough to score the mushroom risotto, and it was perfect.  Sugar snap peas, Drinks are fantastic too. A margarita that doesn't taste like chemicals, perfect martini's, and a G-Spot(grapefruit, pom, and vodka), make FEZ a perfect place for lunch or dinner.~~#~1
Enter your credit card information..chose your wash type....enter wash.....ahh clean.The automatic wash at this place is great and touch-less! I used to have to get out of my car and remove the antenna, so it wouldn't be sucked into those heavy foam sheets that touch car washes use. I never understood the point of those, but as a kid, was frightened by them. It was like your car was being engulfed and swallowed, I felt like Captain Ahab, in the belly of the white wale.   With this touch-less wash, no need to worry about antennas, mirrors, or anything else protruding from your car, or feeling like a character from classic literature. The prices are meh for what you get, just spend the extra 2 $ and get the 8$ wash. It gets your car super clean, and has a full dry at the end. 6$ bucks gets you no dry, and 7$ gets you a mediocre wash, that will make you say "did I get my car washed at all?" With the 8$ you get this special Green Foam spray stuff, and extra rinse and polish deal. This place would be 4 stars if they wash options were better, but overall it's not a bad place to get your car clean. They have vacuums and vending machines that disperse air fresheners, towels, and small bottles of armor-all...in case you are too lazy to go to AutoZone (which I am sometimes)  My favorite car wash moment:An unexpecting patron approaches "change" machine, in his attempt to get change for his 10 dollar bill, in which he plans to purchase the aforementioned green ever-green tree air freshener. He proceeds to insert said 10 bill  into machine. Clang...Clang.... like a slot machine in Vegas the change drops from the machine, as he reaches down he realized he just bought 10$ worth of wash tokens!  DOH!!!!He proceed to swear in Spanish..as his girlfriend laughs at him.  Little did he know that this Car Wash has it's own currency, and is a sovereign nation of the United States.....~~#~0
Great food! Good prices.~~#~1
Look it upsets me that you have to give even one star. I can read the other reviews and I have been here more than a few times but tonight it was just beyond a bad dinner. Yes, we were the table of 7 people at about 8pm, yes we were group at the high top tables that were pushed together. You would have to remember us because we were the table that had 1/2 of a waiter. It was so nice of you to take the time to take our order and then let the waiter go home because he had been there since lunch. You know what sucks more than working 2 shifts? How about being the last table for the guy who worked 2 shifts, it was so nice of the manager to let him leave, but hey how about taking the time to have someone FINISH the open orders? Simply the food was not good and you are over priced.But the worst part is that your staff is just not good at their job, THEY DONT CARE and that is a result of MANAGEMENT not caring.~~#~1
One star would be giving it a holiday gift!For me Copper Star Coffee Shop has been a place where consistency and pride is taken in their food and presentation. Unfortunately, Circle H BBQ is nothing like the prior statement.My first visit to Circle H BBQ centered on ordering a half slap of ribs. They were extremely over-cooked.  There was more charcoal on the top, back and ends that was just not editable.  Once you scraped away the charcoal, on the tops, ends and the center ribs, there was one that was eatable. The company offered me a second chance to try their food, by giving me a complementary full slap.  Nothing had improved.They say they smoke the ribs, but there was no odor to that effect. In face the ribs I ordered the second time spend over 20 minutes on the grill after the order was placed.Btw...the waitress at the front counter couldn't even tell be the type of rub on the ribs and the type of cut they were. When I asked if they were smoked (cooked) daily, she said some are if you get here early - others were from the refrigerator from last night. The so called "dry-rub" seasoning was tasteless. The BBQ sauce is major strange!The bottom line is the ribs were not worth the cost they were charging. ($14/Half for 6 bones and $26/Whole 12-13 bones both with sides) I have high hopes for the brisket, but it might be a while untill I try that endeavor.Overall if they don't change the way they 'burn" the ribs, run, run or drive real fast to another place.  The charcoal is not good for you and there is lots of it!Honey Bears, My Mothers or even driving to Famous Dave's is well worth the trip.Sorry to burst your bubble, I too, had high hops for a centrally located rib place.  I'm still waiting.~~#~1
I hate having to give out three star reviews. For me, 1-star isn't the worst possible rating you can an establishment, a 3 is. Because 3 stars means it invoked no reaction to you, neither joy or disgust, no pleasure or pain. I'd rather eat at a really shitty place that I'll remember than a so-so eatery that I'll forget the moment I get back into my truck.If I want mediocre "take it or leave it" food I'll just cook for myself, kthxbye.As BFeF's (Best Frienemies Forever), Clarice W and I frequently have lunch together in the Peoria area. The decision on what to eat is usually made using the following criteria: Where haven't we been that we can yelp about?Our last lunch involved us going to Hope Kee and getting all wrapped up in their cutesy snack section and coming in late to work. So we needed somewhere relatively closer with no Hello Kitty gummi lips to distract us from our voyage back.Clarice suggested Casa Filipina, a Filipino place by the Lenny's Burger somewhere near but not necessarily 35th Avenue.We were welcomed in by the staff and taken immediately to a nice cozy table by the window. We were given our menus by the excited and talkative waiter I would come later to know as "that fucking guy". At first I was a little troubled reading the menu. I was once in a relationship with a Filipino girl that was so tumultuous and unloving that when I seriously thought of breaking up with her that my first thought "but  man, I love her mother's cooking...". But aside from the adobo and lumpia, I saw nothing else on the menu that I could recall from all those awkward awkward family dinners.I can't tell if this means there's more to the cuisine than I'm aware of or that said ex's mother was, as well as a good cook, a fucking liar. Either way, I'm glad I left her in the end anyway.I ordered the Dinguan, which translates as "chocolate pork".Don't be fooled by the name, all you saucy foodies out there thinking of that Iron Chef America where they made savory dishes with chocolate.Chocolate pork is actually pork cooked in pig's blood. I'll repeat that.It's pig's blood. It's called "chocolate pork" because the blood takes on a brownish-black hue after it's been cooked.After hearing this from that fucking guy, Clarice changed her original order (we even order the same thing! aren't we just the cutest!) to the Bistek Tagalog, which she was familiar with and knew she would like.All the entries come with at CFB is a side of ride. I'm not sure if it's jasmine, white, or saffron, because I always opt for noodles when given the option. And if you get that fucking guy, that rice doesn't even come with soy sauce. After serving us, he disappeared into the bakery, talking it up with some of the other customers. Clarice didn't get her soy sauce until after we had finished our entrees and were on our second helping of rice. Thankfully my chocolate pork came with a lot of sauce and I was able to dribble it on my rice. That's right, muchachos. We trannies prefer blood on our rice. You think about that the next time you try to tell us what bathrooms we can use, amigo.I couldn't taste the pork. All I tasted was the blood. They could've just dumped a quart of blood on my rice and called it a day. The texture was nice though.Clarice wasn't as fortunate with her dish. While I've tried to stay away from beef (it's enough of a commitment to keep my vegetarian brother off my back but not interfere with my eating habits), I had some of the Bistek, and it was passable. It reminded me of beef jerky, with its dry spicy roughness. Good, but not sure if that's how it's meant to taste.Moral of the story: Clarice's entree did NOT make its own gravy, which made eating her rice a little inconvenient. And seriously, JUST rice (really good rice, but seriously, how hard is it to make good rice)? Even my neighborhood so-poor-it-steals-its-recipes-from-other-restaurants Chinese place gives you an eggroll or wonton with your meal. As the place is so fucking proud of its desserts, we ordered some. Clarice got the Creme Brulee and I got the mango tart. That fucking guy was in the middle of bringing Clarice her spoon when he caught the attention of another customer, so we sat for a good few minutes waiting to dig in. In the meantime, I managed to come up with a name for the color of the filling in my tart : burnt earwax. My tart was about as tasty and edible as that term would imply.Clarice's creme brulee was good, albeit a little cold by the time that fucking guy came with her spoon.On our way out I learned that the bill had to be over 10 dollars before they would accept debit.After I imagined beating every one of the staff near to death with a rolling pin, I got an eclair to go.What I got was a bunch of whipped cream between two pieces of rock-hard pastry that you'd get at Fry's. Essentially, a diabetes sandwich.Casa Filipina isn't good. But it's not bad.That's the proble~~#~0
"Fine dining" is not just a setting.  it isn't just good food.  It is many things that add up to an attitude. I have had the opportunity to find it in different cities. I found it the other night at the Stockyards.We were seated by a host who took us to our table and when we were properly seated gave us menus.  Our server came to the table and introduced herself and said she would return shortly.  It was nice to have a moment to chat before we had to think about ordering.  When she did return,  our glasses were filled-not something we should have  to wait for her to do when the service is right.  She knew the selections on the menu and all available options and could make sensible comments concerning them.  Our salads were served promptly by two additional people and were as fresh as I could ask for.  When my friend was finished with hers they asked if they could take her plate.  I was pleased when they didn't ask me if I was finished with my salad and could they take my plate.  If I'd been finished I could have told them.  We were able to continue our conversation uninterrupted as I finished my salad.  The salad plate was removed  when it was appropriate and we had a few minutes before the entrees were served.  All was in keeping with a relaxed dining.  At no time did I have to think about having drinks refilled, it just happened quietly.After a few minutes our dinners were served by the two gentlemen and our server appeared to make sure they were to our satisfaction before we started.  There was no room for error there that couldn't be resolved before we started.  My friend had ordered a small steak. My friend is  quite elderly and Kathy, our server, discretely asked her if she'd like it cut for her.  A potato also was served with her dish.  I asked my friend which of the condiments she would like it prepared with.  She look at me and said "Prepared with?" She didn't understand what I was getting at but Kathy did and was already reaching for the potato.   She opened the potato and smiled while my friend said a bit of everything.  One doesn't go to a restaurant like the stockyards to have to deal with opening a hot potato and preparing it.   When serving is done properly, these things don't have to be discussed.  Kudos to, Kathy!!!.  That is part of the fine dining experience.I had a full rack of ribs which were so tender the meat fell of them.  The sauce had spice to it but not so strong the flavor of the meat was concealed.  I also can tell you that unless you are a big eater, half a rack would fill most people.  My friend said, "Yummy!"  and I agreed.  I am used to getting a finger bowl for clean up after eating, but I can't complain about the two extra napkins and several ways of cleaning my fingers that accompanied my ribs.  My friend let them know we were celebrating the 17th anniversary of my 39th birthday so they served me a free desert.  I can assure you the pecan pie is a delight!  Warm and laced with brandy, it was perfect way to finish our dinner.The stockyards, I might mention, is not inexpensive, but what an enjoyable way to spend your money. They do offer two dinner specials you won't find at most other places.  They do have a luncheon menu that has lower prices.   Don't expect chrome and music that is a bit to loud as many of the new places offer.  Instead, just enjoy a time and place where they pamper you as you should be when you go to the Stockyards.I don't consider the stockyards to be a place you where shorts and Nike's, but of course there are always a few.  I would say a nice shirt and slacks at least.~~#~1
i love this place. i can always spent all my money here on something.  they have great sales racks, but also reasonable clothes not on sale too. the atmosphere is always chill and the people working are super friendly. Also if you get bored of shopping for clothes, they have random stuff like board games and books you can buy.~~#~1
It's like a 50 inch LCD TV mounted in a crack den.Something nice located somewhere shady.I ran to Circle K across the street for a late night Diet Pepsi (yeah, I know how to party) and I felt like I was on an episode of "The Wire" about to do a hand to hand drug buy.Hotel is decent.  Nothing special on the outside.  Bed was damn comfortable so I guess that's all that matters.Free wifi throughout but good luck getting anything over 1200 baud modem speed.  (my inner nerd coming out)Make sure you stay on a Wednesday, there are free drinks and appetizers in the courtyard.Bust out your flack jacket and sprint to the lobby and you'll be all good.Free shuttle to and from the airport.Hood.~~#~0
I spent almost 2 years searching for a good nail salon in the North Scottsdale area and I will never go anywhere else again.  It is very clean, the girls are very nice, and they always do a really good job on my nails.  They are upfront about their pedicure prices - they hand you a price sheet that tells you exactly what you get for each upgrade - instead of pressuring you into getting something better and then upcharging you.  I think their prices are super reasonable as well.  For the best pedicure and a french gel manicure I pay $70.  I usually make appointments (Sunday mornings are nicely uncrowded), but I've also walked in and been taken fairly quickly.  I love this place and will recommend it to anyone who asks!~~#~1
I love vegetarian restaurants! I support them 200%. So glad this place exists in Phoenix. The quality of the food is beyond excellent. The meals are creative and super tasty. Never disappointed. The only qualm I have is the service. It...is...slow. Whether it's the time it takes for my meal to reach my table or the cashier taking my order to ring it up correctly. The length of time it takes should not be so long. Prices are a bit steep but most vegetarian/vegan restaurants are priced a bit higher than others. I don't mind paying more for quality. Overall this place is a favorite weekend visit. I can't wait for my next meal at Pomegranate Cafe.~~#~1
Ruth's Chris, the only steak house I can fully endorse.  500 degree plates make the sizzle a memorable experience.  The Ahi tuna appetizer is also a must have to start the meal off right.  While every salad they have is a can't miss, I'll go there just to get the Chop Salad.~~#~1
Place is always friend, and I LOVE THE PIZZA.     It's by far my favorite pizza place.   Sign up on their VIP newsletter or eclub and you get a free pizza on your birthday, get it for free and try it.     Sounds good to me.~~#~1
Quite possibly the best place to eat in Mesa. Let me tell you what you are in for if you go. The CPC has taken these pilgrim pockets to the next level.  Personally I would recommend The Royale With Cheese or the Shepard's Pie. The pies take a while to make so now would be a good time to order drinks as well. If you are the beer drinking type I would suggest the Hoegaarden it's the best I've ever had. If you are looking for something more stimulating you may want to try their Irish Car Bombs. Or if you are you are up to it go with both.When your pasty arrives don't touch the plate! It could be scorching bloody hot. Your pasty is probably going to take a few minutes to become edible as well, just stay clam it will cool soon enough. When you have finished eating get the apple stuffed pasty for desert. By now you will feel very full, I know, I do it every time and the only thing I can say is that it was worth it.Cheers!~~#~1
Just kind of there with nothing special about this convention center. And the Phoenix downtown area is pretty boring and sparse except for the baseball stadium right next to it with some cool bars and restaurants. When there isn't a game, this area seems pretty dead.Bottom line: Ho hum. Baseball stadium nearby is great entertainment option but can be a pain with all the traffic if you are trying to get out of the convention center area in the evening.~~#~0
I decided to give this place another shot.  This time around I was sober, and thus have actual memories.After grabbing a drink my friend and I decided to head out to the patio.  A group of 3 guys graciously let us share their table since the place was packed.  A short period later one of the guys pours his drink into the candle holder and storms off.  I made a comment about it being his time of the month and I'm not so sure they appreciated it because they all left.  Although, the most sober of the bunch seemed embarrassed.  Whatever, free table, woohoo!Next table starts having a beer fight.  I'm not kidding.  I then started feeling really old.And overdressed.An employee comes by to clean up the empty bottles from my table and notices the candle holder full of liquid.  I told him about the guy with PMDD.  He made a little joke about the the guy being upset over my rejection of him.  Final analysis- Patron has some cool employees and some not so cool customers.~~#~0
This place has a lot of potential; I really want it to do well. I went there on Saturday night with my husband around 7 pm and it was jam packed. Good for them! We felt a little out of place since it was a much much older crowd, (in bad capris, shorts and flip flops...doesn't anybody make an effort anymore? This part of town, I guess.) Anyway, we had a nice booth, but it was directly across from the pizza oven, so we were quite warm. Pleasant server, good busser/foodrunner keeping our waters filled. We decide to try the Bruschetta for a starter and the Rib-eye dinner for two for $28...an unbelievable price. The Bruschetta was quite good (and at $6 also a good value) and with a nice mozzerella and balsamic drizzle...it was tasty. The Rib-eye's on the other had, were not so nice. But, I must stress, these meals were $14 each...what did I expect? The steaks were large and tough; my husband said his tasted old. Yikes. Mine wasn't that bad, and the potatoes and veggies were flavorful. Our thoughts, under the premise of "if we were running this restaurant", are: we would have offered a much smaller but higher quality piece of steak. Food for thought, Javino's. In our opinion, quality over quantity every time.  As we were eating we were able to keep an eye on the drama with the staff...and  watch how hard those boys in the kitchen were working! It was really busy, and they all did seem to work well as a team, manager included. At one point, a sweet, young server comes back with a couple of plates to the manager  (I guess someone sent back there food) and burst into tears. Ah, we felt so bad! I hate it when customers make the server cry and if the food was no good how on earth is that her fault?! Well, major points to the manager who gave her a big hug and went to deal with the table. I was impressed. Also, live music going on... a very nice touch. We left feeling like it was an okay place, I liked better than my husband, but something was just kind of "off". Maybe they have an identity crisis? Are they a wine bar or are they trying to be fine dining? Either way, I definitely want to go back again soon to try something else on the menu. If for no other reason than how kind that manager was to the server. I have worked in the industry and have been treated like garbage in the same situation. So, kudos. Your staff looks happy.~~#~0
was super duper busy when i ordered. but then again, they were a fast food place, and i waited for my To Go order for 25 minutes. They have 5 or 6 people inside their kitchen. And a lot were waiting for their food cos there were some mixed up. Will go back though cos I know those things happen when it's a busy day. The food was bomb specially the hotdog!~~#~0
We've been going to Santisi for close to 10 years since they are just around the corner from my house. We've never had a bad item here. It's a fun place to go and the food is great. We always order pizza which is consistently good. Their salads are excellent - all their ingredients are very fresh and there's enough for two meals if you're a lighter eater. And the wings are always excellent. We've always had good service and the staff keeps the beverages coming. It's a great place to watch a game - if you can get in! Friday and Saturday nights are so crowded we often grab a beer while we wait for our take-out pizza. The parking can be a challenge since the stripes are laid out weird and there's a dollar theater next door. You can park in back (the side toward the freeway) if there's no room in the front.We moved away in 2006 and came back in 2010 and Santisi was still there, and as good as ever.~~#~1
Oh Chipotle, I love you.  Healthy options even when craving Mexican!  My favorite is the chicken burrito bowl with fajita veggies.  Served on a bed of rice with black beans and pico de gallo, with some spicy corn thrown in....ahh my mouth is watering already.  I've been to many locations, and all are clean, food quality is excellent, service is friendly and professional, and I always leave satisfied.  5 stars to you, my friend.~~#~1
These are simply the BEST sandwiches and salads. If you like your food (a) locally grown; (b) freshly made; (c) organic/all natural; and (d) yummy - and who doesn't? - this is the place for you.Now, admittedly they have something of a soup-nazi routine set up and if you walk in and don't know the drill, it can be confusing.  So pay attention:   1.  Look at menu.2.  Decide what you want.3.  Wait your turn to order.4.  Order (give your name).5.  Wait your turn to be called to pay the other girl for the order you placed.6.  Pay her.7.  Wait until your food is ready.8.  Leave with your food.Note that there is no place to sit inside - so you can either sit outside, or, (if it is 157 degrees out that day), see if you can find a place to sit over at LUX, they are very welcoming of Pane Bianco diners. It's all good.~~#~1
After a couple recent visits I can't help but notice that Mellow Mushroom just isn't the place it was when it first opened.  I remember enjoying full pints of St.Berardus Christmas Ale at happy hour prices as well as other "high gravity" options that were served in normal glasses.  Now they're in smaller glasses that look like a highball or rocks glass, but the price isn't smaller.   When I go in prime dining hours somehow 3 of us can rack up a tab exceeding $100 and it just seems a bit extreme for pizza 'n beers.  This isn't the Biltmore or Kierland.  It's a very middle class area and I'm not sure how the prices are a good match for folks who live nearby and dine here.But it's not just the prices I guess.  It seems like a lot of the servers are not happy and give attitude, and I'm a very polite person in public so I know it wasn't me. At the bar last winter I've chatted with a guy who knows a lot about beer but lately it seems the bartenders are just attractive females who don't really know craft beer, and the overall demographic in the bar isn't the same.  Call me an old fart, but I'd rather talk about West Coast beers than have all the eye candy.  Also they have all these wonderful beers but it seems like everyone around me was ordering Coors' Blue Moon.  Why can't those people just hang out at TGI Friday's?~~#~0
The noodles are delicious here. I had the vegetarian spicy noodle. It doesn't come with anything but noodles and the sauce. It would be great if they could add some veggies in there though. So you chose the type of noodle you want and then the flavor. The prices are super cheap and the service is fast. The portions are huge and I could have eaten the whole plate if I didn't stop myself. I am curious to know if they use MSG because it was that hard to stop eating.~~#~0
Delicious, clean, great service! 3 hours later and we are still talking about how delightful this place was. We had the pulled pork and chicken sandwich - both were moist and fresh. Dinner for 2 for 20.00!~~#~1
I love this second location in the Royal coffee series as much as the one at the market!Since it's summer - I thought I should mention that the iced coffee is so smooth and amazing that you don't even have to add anything to it!! Don't believe me?  Ask for a sample next time you are here and I guarantee you will be astounded!A quiet and chill atmosphere if you want to work/study/read as well as a great place for delicious grab n' go coffee in the Biltmore area!~~#~1
Restaurants that are open 24 hours play an important role for certain kinds of people - ones that work odd hours, people who like to eat at non-standard times of day, and, of course, people who are out late partying and want to put something in their stomach at 3 am. Taco Felix is a godsend for anyone who falls into one or more of the above categories. It provides decent and affordably-priced Mexican food 24 hours a day and best of all, it has a drive-through. My husband and I tried this place for the first time for lunch today. We went at a standard time of day because this place is just a few blocks from us and we wanted to see if it was decent before we tried it out one night after midnight after karaoking it up at Silver Pony (just a block or so away). We ordered 4-5 different items - rolled tacos, bean tostada, carne asada taco, quesadilla supreme, and a chile relleno - and a large soda, and it only came out to $12! As a side note, the credit card receipt didn't provide a space to leave a tip, so you should bring a few bucks to thank the employee working for their efforts. The only major downside was that it took quite a while for our food to come, since the drive-through was hopping (lots of people getting menudo after a crazy Friday night, I'm assuming) and there were only 2 chefs and one server (who had to take and serve both drive-through and eat-in orders). However, the food was definitely decent and the portions really sizable, and we felt that it was a great value for our money. Now that we know Taco Felix serves good food for good prices, we won't hesitate to come back during one of those unusual times - to get a chorizo/egg burrito on the way to an early morning flight, to grab a mid-afternoon snack when most other places are closed, or to fill our stomachs late one night after a few drinks.~~#~0
TIP #1 to Mesa-Gateway fliers: This is the ONLY bar at the airport, so live it-love it. Food is great. The burgers can be made low-carb - especially great this gurl! TIP #2: Food can be ordered to go...~~#~1
Truly a great owner who cares about his customers!   I highly recommend a visit if you like one of a kind, quality pieces....young, yet classic, tasteful, yet funky.  "~~#~1
I'm so in love with this place :) I tried the pepperoni pizza and I was AMAZED. i love that they have a fresh herb/vegetable garden in the front.  It's all about the FRESH ingredients these days.  I can't wait to go back and try different dishes. I'd like to try the cheese platters :) mouth watering as we speak.  going again to day so I'll keep adding to this review. STAY TUNED! BTW, the decor reminds me of the VIG but definitely more spacious dining area.~~#~1
This place was just... okay. First I'd like to say that my bridal consultant (don't remember her name - sorry) was really nice and helpful. But to me most of the other saleswomen had "desperation" all over their faces (don't know if they work off of commission, or if the higher ups are just slave laborers, or what, but I'm sure some of them would've killed for a sale). I found a few dresses I liked, but they were way too high pressure for me to be able to make a solid decision on the spot, so I decided to wait on it. I ended up finding a dress I liked better for about 1/3 of the price somewhere else. I notified David's Bridal "thanks but no thanks" about 6 months ago. To this day I still get calls to my cell phone asking me to "come back in and try on the dress"... they're like the telemarketers of the bridal world! So annoying. Plus their accessories are so expensive, and very cookie cutter. I'd go somewhere else, unless you're new to this and need some ideas.~~#~1
Tried this restaurant with a groupon. Probably would not have, if I didn't have the coupon. Don't let the storefront and decor stop you from going in. The restaurant is super clean and the wait staff is very friendly. And the food, WOW!  We split the Shrimp Ceviche and the combination pupusa plate. The portions were very generous. I ordered the fruit drink. Everything was absolutely delicious. One of my new favorite restaurants . Will definitely be back.~~#~1
Needed to kill some time before catching our flight home and decided to check out Old Town Scottsdale. After walking around the tourist trap shops we decided to stop at RnR for lunch. It was pretty busy for a Thursday afternoon, but then again it was St. Pats day, and spring training was nearby.Inside and outside the restaurant there were plenty of TVs going with the latest March Madness games. It did take a little longer than expected to be helped once we were seated, but after that everything else was fine, the staff was very friendly and welcoming.I had the seared ahi tacos. The portions were a little small (although I guess it was under the small platter section), but they were still very tasty.If yelp offered it, I would give RnR 3.5 stars. It's not somewhere I would go out of my way to visit, but I would suggest it to a friend, and if the opportunity presented itself, I would go again.~~#~0
Intense!~~#~1
I really wish I had a dagger to stab myself in the face for trying to eating here. Absolutely the WORST PLACE in the entire valley. I would turn around and go ask for my money back but I am to embarrassed to even be seen in the drive through again. Was on my way home, thought I would give it a shot. I ordered random items; chicken taco and onion rings. The taco was like eating out of a horse trough.. It fell apart immediately and I found myself trying to shovel it into my mouth. After about two bites I realized the meat was questionably chicken. The onion rings were so blah I didn't even touch them. Please do your self a favor.. Dig in the nearest dumpster for lunch, then go home and pound a bottle of vegetable oil. It sure beats the hell out of this joint. No joke.~~#~1
A great little spot to find! Fresh, Fresh, Fresh Sushi and great eats! Be sure to try the green bean appetizer!~~#~1
We had read good things about Over Easy, and were excited to try it out. We went a few days after Christmas, and were horribly disappointed.When we walked in, we were seated by one server. Then, a few minutes later, another host came up to us and asked why we stole a table and did we not understand how seating works? We were quite confused and offended, as we were seated properly and had done nothing wrong.Then, once we ordered, we waited over 45 minutes for our food. Finally, we asked about it, and then it was out within a few minutes. They had completely lost our order.When our food arrived, one dish (the Over Easy -- toasted brioche with spinach & an egg) was absolutely inedible. The brioche was so burnt that we could barely cut it, as was the bacon. The fried egg was very undercooked, even though we requested it completely cooked through. I was honestly shocked the server brought us the dish without saying anything, since it was clearly burnt.The other 2 dishes (banana & pecan french toast, and the Loretta sandwich) were just alright -- certainly nothing to rave about. And, the 3 of us ended up splitting these 2 dishes, since the other dish was awful. We ended up leaving early because we were all so disappointed. At which point, our server asked if we'd like a box for our uneaten burnt brioche. It would have been much more appropriate for her to ask if there was something wrong with it, since it was obviously not eaten.Anyway, I'm not sure if we just caught them on a bad day, but I would never go back again or recommend Over Easy to anyone else.~~#~1
This is place IS Beer Heaven!  Over 100+ taps of amazing beers! This is the ONLY place I will purchase [several] beers at full price, not on happy hour. Amazing thing #2 ~ (for the girls) they have a "shorty" glass which is a 9oz glass instead of 12oz, it is a beautiful thing! Now I can order two different kinds of beer without getting overly full (er bloated), instead of the two big 12oz glasses! Amazing thing #3 ~ The food is delish!!! My boyfriend and I split a burger. Bad idea. It was so good we really didnt want to share it afterall ;)Amazing thing #4 ~ The staff are awesome! There are several staff behind the bar and ALL are happy and willing to help you if your initial server is MIA. They are very attentive, friendly and helpful if you can't decide :) Amazing thing #5 ~ The atmosphere is awesome and the music they play is great!~~#~1
As far as fast Japanese food at lunch this is as good as it gets.  They have a different Bento Box lunch special everyday.  The box comes with plenty to eat, including Miso Soup which arrives shortly after ordering.  The meal includes sushi, salad, rice, chicken (teriyaki or such), gyoza, some type of fried fish and an orange.  For about $8-$10 it's hard to find a better deal.  I would highly recommend CherryBlossom for those looking for a Japanese meal.  It is small, quiet and a little hard to see from the street, which makes it a unique place with low traffic, but high quality.~~#~1
I've eaten here one time, and I enjoyed a very decent meal.  I'm not really sure if I'll go back though, and I'll tell you why.  The place kind of gave me a strange vibe:-It didn't *feel* like a restaurant, it almost felt like a business that had turned into a restaurant.-The take-out menu/brochure was worded pretty peculiarly in places.-This one's hard to explain, but I sort of sensed some very subtle yet unsettling religious undertones throughout the whole experience.Had the China wrap.  It was kinda good, even if it did taste like homemade American teriyaki.  In a spinach tortilla.  With a side of yogurt.  --*sigh* Do you see what I mean?  A funny vibe.  I can't quite shake it.  Maybe I'll give it one more chance.~~#~0
I frequent RnR quite a bit for happy hour.  I've been here tons of times since I moved to AZ.  Definetly one of the best happy hours in old town.  Happy hour from 4-7 LOVE IT (I get mad when places are 3-6- who gets off work that early??).  And pretty every drink is on special during happy hour.  Really cheap wine, beer, and liquor.  Ya their food isn't orgasm AMAZING but it's pretty good.  I've havn't disliked anything I've tried there.  I love the atmosphere and outdoor patio on both levels.I've been for breakfast too and the bottomless mimosas are wonderful.  They keep em coming.  The food is good breakfast food.  I take family/friends from out of town here for happy hours.I love this place I don't get what the hate is about!~~#~1
Nice casita that can sleep 6 for $99, plus free breakfast. What a deal. Service was excellent but the catered food was TERRIBLE!~~#~1
I had a hard time even giving this place the third star.  I had high hopes as I watched this place go through renovations during the past 3 years.  We were there on opening night and fell in love with the decor.  The place was stylish and cool.  Concrete, leather, glass...very retro-modern.  The people who refurbished and redesigned this place deserve five stars.The people who work there, however, deserve one.  On opening night, I forgave the delay in service.  I forgave the nasty arugula on my panino.  I forgave the store-bought peperoni.  Mostly, I forgave them because the onion straws were so good.We went back a few nights later after being fleeced for $40 in return for table scraps at Sens.  It took almost twenty minutes to order two pizzas and onion straws.  Then, the pizzas came out before the onion straws.  How do you cook pizza faster than deep frying an onion?  The waiter lingered around the female members of our party and were just incompetent.  We finally went again after a night of drinking at the Clarendon.  What a buzz kill.  Not only was it too dark and the music was too loud but, again, the service was slow and dull.  Then, the waitress got into an argument about the ingredients of the pizza with our group.  Big no-no.I've had multiple people tell me that service is fine as long as you order from the bar.  They say, just get up and go tell the bar tender what you want.  Why should I have to do all of the work?  How is it that they have ASU students at their disposal in a terrible economy and can't hire any decent waiters?From now on, I'm only going after a game when I want some onions and a Moretti.~~#~0
I have had a couple of peels at A-Peeling Faces and they were the best I've ever had!  They are not only very reasonable priced, but Darla Salem really knows her stuff.  My skin has never looked better!  I am very pleased.~~#~1
Had a fantastic experience! Hernan, our server was excellent. Knowledgable and charming. The food was fantastic. The chefs selection meat and cheese tray was insane. Crazy flavor. Well done!~~#~1
Oh my goodness, Hank is awesome! We've had nothing but problems with landscapers and we finally found someone we'll be sticking with. Hank is very professional, knowledgeable, responsive, prompt, communicates thoroughly and is very reasonable.  And by the way...he's actually there doing the work! Trust me, we've gone through them all and I had almost given up hope.  Hank has been better than expected - we almost don't want to tell anyone so he doesn't get too busy for us!  :)~~#~1
Some of the best pizza I've had in Phoenix. I prefer to get takeout since the inside is a little...eh... but who cares if the food's good! I love the crust, crispy and slightly chewy. The pizza can be a little greasy sometimes (but hey, it's pizza), but as long as it doesn't soak through and make the crust all flimsy (which has never happened with the pizzas I get here!) it's nothing that a paper towel or two can't fix! I'm not a big wing person but my dad has had them and he says they're pretty good.The staff has always been super-friendly, and they actually remember me, even though I only come in once every couple months!~~#~1
Los Olivos is a Scottsdale institution and I won't hear a word against them. Especially not when I have a few margaritas in me. They take good care of regulars, especially at Happy Hour. The chips and salsa are delicious and they keep them coming. I recommend the mini menu, they are a great way to sample stuff if you like to try a lot of different things, but my favorite meal is definitely the Chicken Poblano. Mmm, so good! The shrimp chimi is also fantastic. I never leave without feeling totally stuffed.~~#~1
I finally found a reasonably priced salon and a stylist who understands what I want.  Very happy with the service.  Also, the waxing lady is very nice...I think her name is Maria, does good eyebrows.  Only downside is that sometimes it is hard to get an appointment on short notice...but that's my fault for waiting until I can't stand it anymore to get my hair cut.~~#~1
One of a kind place to experience all senses!!  Food was great, service was great, AND they have a Moroccan Healer on staff.  Ask to taste the Moroccan Black Stone (not on normal menu).  I won't spoil how it makes you feel, but trust me when I say you will enjoy yourself! ;)~~#~1
I've been to Bookman's a few times and have mixed feelings about it. If you're going just to look around, it's fun to see all the stuff they have in there. Between the movie selection, CD's, books and trinkets, it was fun to shop around. But, as someone interested in selling to them, I would never do that again. I brought in a huge selection of books I was interested in selling and they only took 4 of the books and offered me a few measely dollars. I was shocked. I understand they need to make a profit but I wasn't even getting $1 for each book they wanted. A total rip off if you ask me and a waste of time waiting for them to look through my stuff. I'm not sure if I will be returning anytime soon.~~#~0
This place is absolutely amazing.  If you are looking for a quick sweet treat this is the place to go.  It a little hole-in-the-wall looking place, but once you take a bite into one of their homemade ice cream sandwiches, your mind will change.  I usually go for the mint ice cream with chocolate chip cookie, but when it's fall, I can't pass up the pumpkin ice cream with snicker doodle cookie. I've never found anything like it since.~~#~1
Party of 7 please.  Do you have a happy hour? Yes, handing me a placard with 6 appetizers that are 1-2 dollars off..  Ok, give me one of everything, please. I'm used to saving more than a dollar at happy hour but, the apps ARE good.Our waitress CJ then explains in Thai to my wife and daughter a couple of the dishes.  We order 7 entrees and they arrive in a timely fashion and were all quite tasty.Problem 1  The sticky rice which came with the pork dish was about the size of two of my fingers, should have been at least 4x -10x as much.Problem 2.  The rice which came with 2 of our entress was fine but, we ordered EXTRA rice and, that didn't show up until most of the main dishes were gone.  Even after asking a second and third time, it took 4-5 minutes for them to scoop it out of the rice cooker and bring it,  Not cool, guys.This is my third time here and it is ok but, 5 stars?--not.~~#~0
The food is good, atmosphere a little strange, and the prices a tad high for what you get.  Got a sandwich and a salad.  The sandwich was good, but it was just that, a sandwich.  No accessories.  The salad was also good, but it could have really used a meat on top.  You had the option, but the salad was already a bit pricey to begin with and adding meat would have made it over a $10 salad...for lunch.~~#~0
Oh, where to begin..I stopped by Pappadeaux last week to grab a bite when on a Wed, they told me it was a 45min wait for two.. wow.  The place was packed.   The hostess recommended we make a reservation for the weekend, so we made one for Friday at 7PM.The smells coming from the place when you first pull in automatically keep you wondering what delicious things are waiting inside.  I'm so glad we did. We showed up and they gave us a card with a number and once our number showed up on the screen, it was seating time.  I think we waited maybe ten minutes.After gazing over the menu for a quick minute, we decided to try the fried alligator with creole sauce.  Being one to enjoy new things, I was pretty excited.  The waiter took our drink orders and and put in the appetizer.  The place at this point was insanely packed, but it was nice to see a place like this.  Made ya feel that something good was to come.  Heck, a place cant' suck if it's this packed, right?   So we order our food, I decided on the stuffed shrimp and the rest of my friends all ordered different things.  It would be a share-a-meal night.. About 10min into drinks and conversation, they bring out the fried alligator..  Ok, if you've never eaten anything weird before.  Please please.. you've got to try this.  It sorta reminded me of a cross between soft pork or chicken.  The taste literally melted in my mouth.  To top it off, the creole sauce that went with it, only complimented it.  I could easily have eaten the entire plate alone.  Sadly, I had to share..After quickly destroying the fried alligator, we got our entrees.  I took one bite and had to pause a moment.. the taste of the stuff shrimp with the crab, Alfredo, spices inside just floored me.  There were only six pieces, but after sharing a piece or two and eating the amazing green beans, this was plenty of food. I can't wait for my next trip here.. fantastic food.~~#~1
DV Nail, may I help you? YES! You can - and always well. I've been going to DV Nails for years and they're great. I've "cheated" on them a few times when I hear of similar nail shops in the area offering specials and mini hot stone massages with a manicure but I always end up back at DV Nail. Their massage chairs are wonderful - strong massagers. You actually feel like you're getting worked on. They're clean, friendly and always do a great job for the price. It's not fancy by any means and I wish they'd turn on the radio instead of the fuzzy TV but they're consistently good. They carry every Essie & OPI color and my manicures always last a long time. A manicure & pedicure is $28 total + tip. I think that's great. I typically request Tina or Julie - they both take their time and do great. Don't be fooled by this place... there's often a long wait. I'd recommend an appointment.~~#~1
I will give this place a 5th star even though i wait for 30+ mins every time i go. that can only mean it's good right? Well, it's that friendly AND that good that i dont mind waiting. i hope it doesnt lose that customer service aspect that makes it so approachable. best sausage gravy in town with a nice spice to it. i'm not fond of their potato has thingys... but their bfast nachos are fab and their white out omelette is also very tasty. my favorite item - turkey sausage eggs benedict... DD style (trade sausage gravy for hollandaise) - very filling as you can imagine. breakfast club will still be the old town brunch location for when visitors come visit me but for week in and week out sunday morning brunch, this is my spot.~~#~1
It's a supermarket.  I just go in buy what I need and get out.  It's convenient that there's a wells fargo in there, but there's one across the street as well.  To the negative experience.....My sister was speaking to my niece, but not in english.  Some caucasian lady walks by and rudely says, "Can't you speak english?"  WTF?!?  Is this taking SB 1070 in your own hands?  It's like you're trying to make every race hate you even more.  I will run into this arrogance wherever I go.I'm not done yet.  Keep on reading....My niece had a dollar in her hand and was pointing at the lottery scratcher machine.  We know you have to be of a certain age to play it.  One of the employees there rushes over and in a loud voice tells me niece she can't play it.  Calm down.  Kids are just innocent and don't need this extra verbal abuse in their lives.  Don't you have something better to do like restock the shelves?  Swear... Racial profiling.~~#~1
Stopped in, had a couple of drinks, paid and left. Nothing to get excited over, but a decent stop if you like Irish whiskey and need a fix.~~#~0
We came here Sunday morning for a wonderful breakfast. Our server was Colleen. She was very attentive and we had  a great meal. The menu is so extensive with many ,many options. I got Florentine Eggs Benedict and my boyfriend had a fabulous omelet with potatoes and toast. They were both delish!     Their Potatoes are fab!!   The Decor was very nice, and even though they were so busy,we did not wait long at all for our table.  Big parking lot and a nice waiting area as well. We will defiantly come back here soon.~~#~1
I love Christmas-time and I especially love it because I know that Luminarias is back and this year it's better than ever! The staff and volunteers at the DBG do an excellent job of directing guests through the garden. Between the well-lit paths (with Luminarias of course), helpful staff and amazing acts, this is an event not to be missed! I consider this to be the ultimate activity for adults. It's romantic if you're on a date, it's festive if you're with your family and it's just pure fun if you're with friends. You enter the park to be immediately greeted by hundreds of meowganificant Luminarias lighting up the entire garden. Cocktail stations lie in every knook and cranny and they serve delicious festive drinks like my favorite, hot cocoa and raspberry vodka! If you're hungry, they sell food throughout the garden at two locations. Then there are the performers. The DBG does an amazing job of bringing in musicians of every shape and size. Whether it's a trio of Christmas carolers, a mariachi band or a lively Jazz band, they have bands in every corner lighting up the night! I am also continuously impressed with the acoustics of the garden. With so many live acts in one area, you can barely hear a specific act until you are in that area. Their event planners did an amazing job! Luminarias is my favorite Arizona activity during the holidays and I can't wait to go back next year!!~~#~1
One word can describe the food here:  perfection.All the meals I've had here has been absolutely delicious served by the most charming waitstaff.Someone recently told me their Chilean Sea Bass was the best he's ever had and I believe him . . . I can't wait to taste that dish!~~#~1
My wife stayed here while transitioning to Arizona and enjoyed her stay. The hotel seems modern and they are currently renovating the place; so far so good with the improvements.~~#~0
Mediocre food, mine was really really salty.  Kind of an interesting place though, looks like a Colorado lodge but what's that decor doing in Arizona??  Looks like a good place to go after work for happy hour and hangin with friends, so-so for a nice dinner.~~#~0
All I have to say is WOW! This place is EXCELLENT!   All the dishes we had were extremely fresh, authentic, and DELICIOUS!  My favorite pot stickers EVER.  The skin is super thin, tender, not greasy, mostly steamed encased around a very light, delicate dumpling that makes me want to order 2 next time. 6 is just not enough, they are tiny, but oh so delectable! The sauce is perfectly balanced of sweet, spicy, and tangy and does not overpower the pot sticker.  It also comes with a thin airy, crispy (rice chip?) underneath the pot stickers that give it an extra texture with scallions scattered about.  MMMMMMmmmmm.The green curry is more brothy than others than other's that I have had, but no matter...It is delicious with bits of vegetable, and whatever meat you prefer..we got chicken.  I love sopping it up with rice and trying to eat it with chopsticks.  You may need a spoon :) The eggplant and chicken stir fry is also fabulous.  The asian eggplants are cooked to perfection. Their sauces are spot on.  BEST Coconut ice cream!  It is light, fluffy, icy, dreamy, pea-nutty, coconut cloud confection that makes my mouth water!  It is not sickly sweet sticky artificial coconut tasting at all...Predominant coconut flavor is not my favorite and I LOVE THIS! Even if you don't like curries, there is plenty of food here that will make you a fan!  This is a mom and pop kind of place, they are really nice.  It's a trek for us, but definitely worth the drive!~~#~1
I really like this bar & restaurant.  I usually come here to meet up with a friend and sit at the main bar.  It is modern and clean.  There are a couple bars to sit at and they even open a big door to a bar for the outside too.  They have some good brews on tap and have flat screen tv's as well.  I have only had a burger and fries here.  They burger was really good, the fries were really greasy and were just okay.The staff here is friendly & speedy.  I would recommend this place for a good place for someone looking for a nice place to grab a drink and converse.~~#~1
Really nice!  I'm new to the area and I stumbled upon them.  They are fast and not very expensive.  I was a little turned off by the number of really old men working there, but they had their regular client list.  It was like one side was "old men" hair stylists and the other side was the "young girl" stylists.  The two sides didn't really associate, which I found rather weird.  But, none the less, a great hair style at a great price!!!~~#~1
All I'm saying is they need to do a better job at hiring their staff. The girl that helped us out last time was on something pretty heavy. It was a school night, and we had just finished up dinner next door at Windsor. We all wanted to get something sweet, but the girl working there was so blitzed out of her mind on something. She was barely able to interact with us. Within the first 2 minutes she must have asked us 5 times how we were doing. She never once made eye contact.  I'm not exaggerating by saying she looked pretty filthy, and was really rude to boot. Maybe that's just how the poor girl is, but damn, you think they could do a better job hiring people to compliment the charm of a family oriented cutesy sweet spot. She turned us off so bad, that no one in the party decided to order anything.I give it 3 stars because I've been before, and thought their stuff  was good, not great. Churn is pretty damn adorable & local, so they get extra love for that. So, for now, until something better comes along it will just have to do.~~#~0
This may be my worst dining experience ever.The scenery was beautiful, we can't complain about that. The menu was decent, there was a good number of selections to choose from. However the prices were definitely high, we're just talking tacos & burritos here...I ordered a taco salad with steak. It was $11.99, for lunch...which I thought was crazy.  When I got the salad, it was the cheap iceberg lettuce, with a couple tomatoes & a few onions. The steak was DISCUSTING. I wouldn't feed a dog that steak meat. I asked the waiter for some salad dressing, he gave me this funny look and said "most people just use salsa, but I guess I can get you some ranch or something". Great service, huh? I asked the waiter about the margarittas, and he willingfully told me that the 3 cheapest ones are no good and are too watered down. Nice...so I then asked about the Patron Margaritta (my fav tequilla). The Patron rita was $16!!! The waiter was extremely unprofessional, and even gave us this pitch about how he's only working there until he finds a new "gig". The prices were ridiculous! I would NEVER go there again and hope to share my story with many people before they waste their money!!~~#~1
Stayed at the hotel from 11/18 till 11/23/12. Excellent hotel and the stuff was great. Originally was supposed to come during Hurricane Sandy and couldn't fly out as I was affected by the storm.. The hotel staff had no problem changing my reservation and didn't even change the price. Everything was great. The room was clean. The pool was excellent.~~#~1
Completely shady.  Towed our U-haul as we were moving in to our new Apartment Complex.  Completely unethical and total crooks.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS!~~#~1
I just re-visited Cheese 'N Stuff this weekend after a while.  I guess just eat during their limited hours very often.  They close very early (4pm).I love their liverwurst sandwiches and the Bismark but this time I decided to try the Doughboy people speak of minus mayo as I do not enjoy warm sandwich lubrication.  As ever the place is tiny, homey and spotlessly clean.  I had some of the hot German Potato salad as a side and a ginger ale.   All were yummy, delicious and satisfying!  As I was eating I had a yen for a Celery Soda to go with this classic sandwich but I've only been able to get them at Chompie's in the valley.  There are loads of interesting European cookies to get packages of as dessert so grab a couple of friends when you go but carpool as the lot is smallish.  I guess they stopped giving pickles with sandwiches, bummer.~~#~1
OMG! what is the rave about? this place is disgusting! it's dirty and the food is not worth it! i came here with my family and we each order a little bit of everything that is suppose to be good and popular there. unfortunately everything is bad. i walked by the waiters and they were all cursing really loud in vietnamese to each other. the table is icky and it smell like my cooked up oil . ick! go to Pho ao sen instead at least it's clean.~~#~1
Just great! The gluten free pizza crust is really good. Be sure to order it crispy otherwise it can be kinda chewy (unless you like chewy, then order it however you want). I really dig the BBQ Chicken pizza but I think that they might have recently changed the sauce or something. It's tasted different to me the last time I went. If they haven't changed the sauce, then I *COULD* be loosing my mind. Either way, it didn't taste as good this time around. Just saying~~#~0
Food Truck Fav right here!I've been wanting to try Pizza People's Pizza for a while now.  I found out they were setting up at 180 Degree's Automotive and I figured if Bogi was hosting them then I needed to check them out!  I finally caught up with them at Local Fest.Bogi was actually there helping them out and she told me that they were only sampling the regular pizza and the gluten free pizza was $8 but she assured me it was yummy!  First of all $8 for a 2 item gf crust pizza is a deal!  Secondly, Bogi said they were her some of her best friends in the world...and I trust her implicitly....so I ponied up my dollars and waited about six minutes.  I ordered my pie with pepperoni and fresh tomato.  I took it back to my table to share with my Mama (who is also gluten free) and we both said at about the same time: " Oh, my gosh this is really good!"   Something I've only said about twice since eating gf pizza!The sauce is fresh, the dough was the best gf dough I've had to date and the toppings were just divine.  I need to put a GPS tracking unit on this truck so I can track it daily! (Oh, wait.........I can just check their facebook page!)  Yeah, I'd eat it daily!  It's that good!~~#~1
Horrible service. Twice now I've gone there and they keep messing up my drink. I work for Starbucks!! It's not hard to get a drink right! Believe me. Horrible service. The people that work there All have bad attitude. One lady doesn't even look at you when your ordering your drink. I think that someone needs to go In there and fix it and make it a welcoming Starbucks that it's known for. Ya a few of the employees that work there are absolutely wonderful but when you get that one that is just rude it just makes you not want to go there anymore. I stopped going. They still get my drink wrong when my mom goes to get coffee. Horrible.~~#~1
I'm currently staying at Camelback Inn for 3 days. A pleasant treat after a molar extraction last Friday afternoon. Although I've sworn not to be seen in public with a swollen face, I am truly enjoying this trip. There's a trail just behind this resort and a completely awesome view of the hills. Awesome and I mean it.My hubby is out on his meetings and I'm juggling my work (the luxury of running your own biz, take it anywhere you want do it anytime you want, well not most of the time.. ). Just had lunch at Hoppins Jack. Excellent service, friendly staff (especially the  handsome young german ;)). Anyway, ordered chicken sandwich with cashews and mandarin orange, delish. My lil' girl was pacified with a vanilla sundae with fruity swirl (raspberry or is it strawberries?) with peaches and berries.. I had a few spoonful, yummy.Kids menu was dirt cheap, fries and 3 pieces of chicken strips or rather crispy chunks  was actully tasty.I still have until tomorrow. Maybe if I have time, I'll head down to the spa for a desert rain loofah. Oh, as for the room, great decor, quite spacious and an outdoor porch with umbrella and seat to lounge around in the sun.Simply love the view. It takes me away from everything. I'm in heavenly desert.Highly recommended.~~#~1
This is the location I frequent most (it helps it is less than a mile from my home). I have been to a U.S. Egg (this and other locations) more than a dozen times (or two) since moving to AZ in 2010. I love breakfast food and the "specialty" won me over instantly; PROTEIN PANCAKES! As the timeless Tina Turner once said, "Simply the Best!". That describes these pancakes perfectly. Before I go on and on about the pancakes (because I have been known to do so) some background information about atmosphere, staff etc. This location is in a nondescript one story building in front of the offices at Mill Towne Center (or is it Mill Town Centre?). Nothing fancy, but I don't need a "Jacket Required" sort of feel to a place to enjoy my breakfast. The staff is fantastic; hosts/hostesses, waitresses, busboys. I have never had anyone employed here be anything but 100% professional and attentive. To speak to something others have mentioned about getting the check early (while they are still eating); as long as you continue to be my waitress (i.e. refills, requests for jelly, etc.) I don't care if you bring the bill with the food. If I decide I want something else, I doubt any of the folks here would have a problem reprinting a corrected bill. Now on to the food!! The protein pancakes are filled with blueberries, granola, cinnamon and silvered almonds. The ingredients aren't something exotic, but they are perfectly balanced in the mix (not too much or too little of any of them). The thing about any food item you like at a restaurant, it becomes a favorite because they are able to duplicate it time after time. I have had this item many times (more than any other item), and they are always spot on (knock on wood) :). All the other dishes I have had (always breakfast, haven't tried lunch yet) were some combination of eggs and protein, and the eggs are always perfectly cooked to my specification (over medium), and the meat always juicy. I promise to write another review as soon as I don't get the protein pancakes (which will be when they decide to remove them from the menu - NEVER). :) Oh, or if I actually go in later than normal and feel like lunch over breakfast (not good odds :O).~~#~1
Mesa Amphitheatre is easily my favorite concert venue in the Phoenix area.  You can see and hear from anywhere in the place, and the grassy risers were such a good idea.  The sound was excellent for the two shows I've been to there.  Really just an overall nice, peaceful place to see a show and enjoy the Arizona weather.  Parking isn't too bad and neither are the lines to get in where they check your bags.  To top it all of, getting out of there was a breeze both times I was there.~~#~1
Kaley helped me get the best room in Mesa AZ, my view was awesome. The beds were clean, and the service was awesome, with a great cafe style restaurant. I am recommending to all my friends to call Kaley for a hook up!~~#~1
Waffle Houses are bomb but this one is my favorite.  Not only is it 24 hours but it is super clean and well lit.  There are totally some seedy people who go here but their conversations just make for very interesting background noise.  As far as the food, the prices are cheap, the menu is semi-a-la-carte and the the waffles are amazingly crisp and perfect.  This is THE Waffle House to visit.  Go now, do it.  How good does a waffle sound right now anyways?  That's right, Pretty Damn Good.~~#~1
Brie and Apple with Fig bruschetta....I dont need to say anything else!!!!  (except $5 glasses of wine til 5 all week and $5 mimosas til 5 on the weekends)  Best place to spend a Sunday afternoon~~#~1
Now worthy of 5 stars for replacing their toilet with one that actually flushes. It's always nice when a place that sells diuretic beverages has a working toilet.---The baked goods are baked right there in the coffee house, by their employees.  The coffee is roasted right there, on site. Iced tea refills are free, bitches. The baristas are hep cats who ride fixie bikes. Now, I like to coast, but shit...  Gotta give them cred. If you go often enough, the other regulars will be friendly. If you hate Mac laptops, you probably should stay away. The new tables are great. There are power outlets everywhere. It's next to Pane Bianco. I run into my homies there on the regular. When it comes to coffee shops in CenPho, there is no competitor. Jeff, the owner, is a cool dude. The seating outside is nice. I have been known to spend all day there, and use it as my office away from home and my real office. I seriously probably spend about 16 hours a week there or so, maybe more some weeks, working on my laptop and occasionally people watching. Did I mention that I kind of like this place?~~#~1
This is such a beautiful stadium to go to and relax at, everything is so close that it only take 10-15 mins to get where you want to be, and on top of that, there is westgate shopping center that is right there with all the bars and night clubs to go to after the games. I recommend UOPX Stadium over any other in the valley because its clean and any seat in the house is a great one.!!!!Plus the weather is always great!!~~#~1
This address is for the one next to Panda Express, not the one in Walmart.This place sucks and it doesnt even come close to any other McDonalds. How in the world can you have so many employees working and have a line of people waiting for their food? It's like there is retarded people working there and they all have special needs. This one guys was just waiting for a happy meal and had been waiting for 10 minutes before I even got there. It them about 15 minutes for them to give me my food. One mexican kid that was working was to busy flirting with this girl in front of everyone, while her father was asking why the food was taking so long to make. The dining area was dirty after I got my food and sat down. They should fire the manager and everyone that works there. They take no pride in working there and its sad to see this. It shouldnt matter what they are being paid to be there, its still a job and they ARE being paid to be there. I will NOT be returning to this place.......~~#~1
I ordered a thin crust for carry-out one evening.  The place was somewhat hidden in an industrial area close to Tempe Marketplace.  The staff was very friendly and it seemed like a laid-back, cozy place to eat a meal.I enjoyed my pizza.  The sauce tasted very sweet so be prepared for that.~~#~0
First off, let me congratulate OHSO on being open for business!  I was thrilled to see another local watering hole open in the neighborhood.  I frequent Arcadia Tavern and JT's often and will most likely add O.H.S.O to the rotation.  Upon entering OHSO, I remember my first impression being "Is this place really ready to be open for business".  I noticed a few unfinished details on the building (maybe intentionally) that left me wondering if this place decided to open overnight.Simple said, I appreciate good service.  There was a lack of this at O.H.S.O.  We were not greeted when we walked in.  There was a group of employees talking at the host stand and I had to approach them before they recognized our group.  They quickly said it was open seating and got back to their converstaion.  We grabbed seats in a booth in the bar area.  We probably sat there for about 5 mins trying to make sense of the various colored menus strewn across the table.  As we were all very thirsty for a cold beer, we decided to finally order at the bar.  Someone eventually came by.After some of our party left, 2 of us moved up to the bar and asked the bartender a few questions.  No one seemed to know what was going on.  Everyone appeared to be extremely busy with "busy work" instead of helping the patrons.  Seemed like a lack of training with the staff.  Overall, I think this place has the potential to be a cool spot and truly hope it does well.  If I could offer a few suggestions, they would be:1.  Have a dedicated host(s) greet people at the front door.  Take a hint from Arcadia Tavern.  I have never walked in there and not been greeted by a friendly smile.2.  Get the music in order.  If you want to a progressive/hip local brewery, you are going to have to do better than a "killers" album that was popular 4 years ago.3.  You have something that people want...BEER!  It's great service and attention to detail that will keep patrons coming back.I look forward to my next visit and I hope some of these kinks are worked out.~~#~0
On a recent Sunday night I was kickin it at the Vine, sharing a well-priced pitcher of imported beer with a friend, and taking in the scene. The place looked as though it was in the midst of some sort of remodeling project, but now upon sober reflection, my guess is that it just always looks like that. Night went like this: An order of spudskins from the bar-food menu? Sure! Hmmm- they're kinda dry and cardboardy, but looky there! They've smothered them in baco bits, so I'll bite...Hey- check it out! A guy's setting up karaoke! This might be fun. Oh oh- it's not karaoke, he's got a guitar. OK he's ready to sing. He looks like his name is "Eric". He's standing at the mic with his guitar waiting for the bartender to turn down the jukebox. People are pleading with the bartender to leave the jukebox on because "I still haven't heard my Modest Mouse!" and "I still have 2 more songs coming!" The bartender relents and leaves the jukebox on. Eric goes outside for a smoke. Maybe a drink at the bar. Modest Mouse plays. He gets back on stage and waits. And waits. Finally the jukebox is lowered and Eric starts to play and sing his original songs from the heart. I miss Modest Mouse. Eric sucks. Nowonder the bartender was so slow to turn off the jukebox. We're out of here! Bye!!~~#~0
I took the pole dance aerobics class last night, and man am i feeling it today! everyone there was really welcoming and had great advice for me, as ive never tried this kind of thing before. it's tucked away, and at first i had no clue where it was, but its worth the search! had a blast, got a great work out, and felt great afterwards, im definitely going back for more!!!~~#~1
Hands down the best spa I have visited in the state and perhaps the nation. Massages were amazing.Drinks and brunch were amazing.Staff went out of their way to take care of our every need.Went at 11 am to relax for the day and stayed until 5pm which is unheard of for me at a spa once the initial massage has taken place, but this place kept me going all afternoon with the plunge pool, sauna and steam. Also, the pool and spa hot tube outside were amazing. I honestly cannot say enough about AJi and its wonderful staff.I will return~~#~1
Good food, great atmosphere, great service and great prices! We will definitely be back! Can't wait to try the Sunday Brunch!~~#~1
I really (REALLY) like The Lodge so I was gonna give it 4 stars. To be honest though, I really can't think of any good reason NOT to give it that 5th star.I've mostly been here for Happy Hour when visiting AZ, but I've also stopped in a few late nights, and have always had a good time.The Lodge has one of the best Happy Hours (deal wise) in Old Town. All apps (except the mac & cheese and fried pickles) are half off along w/$2 cheap drafts, $3 Lodge signature drafts (which is a tasty beer) & $3 wells (stuck to beer on this last trip, but if I recall in the past they actually use a heavy pour during happy hour).I've tried quite a few of the apps, and they're all good. The pretzels & cheese are particularly tasty. I always get pretzels & cheese no matter where I am w/the friend I came here w/for happy hour the last time I was here so I can say I've tried quite a few in my day & the Lodge's ranks right up there!I admit I'm a sucker for cheesy theme bars, so I kind of of dig the ski lodge theme here. the dining room area isn't huge, but is clean w/comfy seats. The bar area is pretty big & the patio is nice, weather permitting. I've never had an issue w/the service here & both bartenders & bouncers are always nice.~~#~1
I ordered a thin crust pizza for carry out from this location.  The staff was very friendly and the pizza was pretty good.  I look forward to trying their pasta in the near future.~~#~0
So going on vacation in a week and wanted to get a brazilian for the first time.  I gotta say the technician, Christine, was great!  She tells you what to expect and tosses in a little humor to keep you comfortable.  It was very clean, the wax isn't to hot, and the technician never double dipped.  I found the place very clean and comfortable.  Pricing is just right too.  I like that there are options to buy it for a year and go anywhere they have a shop.I did get told about product as others reviewed.  However, I didn't feel pushed because Christine explained how it can be used and why.  In addition, she told me of other uses for the product.  It was an all around good experience that I would recommend to any friend wanting to get waxed.~~#~1
My dentist recommended this place to me five years ago and every since then, I keep a keen ear to any of her recommendations as Shimagamo is the best sushi I've had anywhere.  I've had sushi in CA, NY, TX and HI.   The fish tastes fresh and the portions are generous.  One piece of advice is to eat at the sushi bar rather than one of the booths, assuming you are having sushi.  In my experience, sushi tastes better served as soon as each sushi piece prep is done rather than waiting for the entire sushi order to be completed.  This place has the best Unagi and an awesome Escolar (which I haven't found anywhere else.)  The Suprise Crazy Roll, served with a sweet wasabi sauce, is always on our Sushi order.The only con is that this place is pricey, but they do have a daily 5-7 happy hour that contains some great options.  However, the best stuff is usually not on the happy hour menu.  Also, this isn't a place to have Sake bombs.  It's a very low key atmosphere for those just looking for an excellent meal.  You'll likely notice early on how many folks are regulars.  I was told this was the spot where many Japanese baseball players come to have their Sushi.The restaurant is very non-descript.  It sits in a corner of a shopping mall and is easily overshadowed by it's neighbor C-Fu Gourmet.~~#~1
This hidden gem is located just outside of Mill Ave and is apparently the hipster home base of Tempe. If somehow you are allowed in without suspenders or nonprescription clear glasses, you will see exactly what goes on. to the left at least four people playing chess, to the right someone reading a book, but sitting next to someone writing a book, and did someone just walk in with a puppy? Yes. As you walk up to the counter you are already disoriented so you may be confused about what to order. Well, they are known for their cappuccinos, which I can personally vouch for but on a hot summer day in Arizona, I recommend their "Dirty Horchata" or "Espresso Excellente" a rice milk horchata with shots of espresso. It was good for the minute it lasted. See you there next time.~~#~1
Mmm!  Delicious Indian food and a great selection of vegetarian dishes.I LOVE the fact that each dish is mildly spiced, and left up to the individual to customize the flavor depending on which sauces they choose.  I'm a spicy lightweight so it was great that I didn't have to worry about getting something too hot to enjoy.I had a bowl of brown rice, cumin potatoes and tofu masala with a cool yogurt-cucumber-mint sauce on the side.  It was fantastic!  I can't wait to go back....also, I thought it was adorable that we were given a golden dollar coin with our check for "making the drive to their location and to compensate for high-gas prices".  A memorable gesture!~~#~1
Many have started out with this and it should be stressed , this wonderful place is TINY! Suggest you make a reservation so you get he chance to enjoy the wonderful food that is in store. We started with the stuffed mushrooms , like many others raved about, and the Portuguese style mussels. Both were fantastic and left us wanting to come back to try the other mussel offerings and appys as well. The endless bread was the perfect tool for soaking up the rich juices the mussels were bathed in.  We're we're pretty full, but thought we would take a run at the Espana pizza. Hands down the best pizza we have ever had. The flavor could not be any better and the perfectly created thin crust let you enjoy the toppings as both a compliment and as a way to get it easily into your mouth! Feels more like you have been invited to a friend's house for an awesome meal as opposed to a restaurant. Great people and they went to all lengths to make ours and the other patrons meal fantastic (even the entirely needy, hard to please, and somewhat obnoxious woman seated near us)While I am sure they would make your super comfortable if you had to wait, suggest you  make a reservation so you can enjoy this great little place~~#~1
This place never ceases to amaze. One of the best breakfast places in Phoenix. The Sicilian scramble is a favorite--though the smashed meatball was great. We finally went back for dinner the other night and for the first time I had a burger. It should not be surprising that is was fantastic. Atmosphere is great, service is great, and the food is great--just go!~~#~1
Just a quick update - this KFC shut down just a few weeks ago. There still might be someone in line tho...~~#~1
I don't actually hunt or fish, but after visiting this place, I'd like to take up those activities. This place is like a giant outdoors amusement park. Everything you could possibly want for outdoor activities is included in this store. I could spend hours in this store just looking at everything they have available. Plus, now I know where to buy the furniture if I ever get a hunting lodge.~~#~1
Had lunch at Bliss again ... still yummy as always! This time I had the ceasar salad and their shoe string  parmesan cheese fries. I still recommend this place for lunch or dinner.~~#~1
I admit it I eat donuts almost everyday and twice on Sundays. Today a I found a new addiction, french crullers, uhhh they are soo good. Melt in your mouth.~~#~1
This is a great little hidden gem! From the outside, it looks like just a dive but the inside is surprisingly nice. The food here is great and they are willing to make things to your taste when it comes to ingredients and spice level. The waitstaff are also very friendly. They came by while we were eating just to make sure we were happy with everything even though this is an "order at the counter" place.Another little bonus is that they have a drink station where guests can help themselves to free refills which definitely comes in handy in Phoenix!~~#~1
This neighborhood sushi bar is one of the best in AZ! Fresh fish, good portions, and great service. A place where not every single roll is filled with imitation crab and drenched in sauce! Majority of their sushi menu is pretty traditional...but the sushi chefs takes special requests if you give them an idea of what you like. I especially like the Cucumber Fiesta, which is a salmon/yellowtail/tuna roll wrapped in cucumber instead rice.The staff is also very attentive. They check on your need often and clear out empty plates promptly. The thing that stood out most was the number of customers who are regulars. As I wait for a table, I always see people greeted by name and received with hugs. There must be a reason why people constantly come back, right? Check this place out and judge for yourself!~~#~1
I'm not really a fan of Jo-Ann.  They don't really do much to help you find what you need.  There are never any helpful people, nothing is labeled properly, and the fabric counter is always a nightmare.  This one is tolerable because no one is ever here.  The people that they hire at this one are just people who need jobs, not people who love crafts.  You better know what you need and where to find it when you go here because it is easy to get lost and there are no Jo-Ann Sherpas to get you back.~~#~0
Amazing sushi. Fast, clean, fresh. Friendly staff. Favorites are Arizona, Beauty, Alaska, and Spicy Ninja, although everything here is some of the best around hands down!~~#~1
A little disappointed...  We have been waiting for the right moment to visit this place and today turned out to be that day.  First of all, the location is in the middle of what looks to be a ghost town.  The interior had a lot of character with items like the family owned John Deer tractor ;)  Anyway, we had the full slab with 2 sides, a bottle of ginger beer and a drink.  Honestly, I expected more from this place.  The meat was dry, bland and over done.  My bf and I both agreed that our fav in Arizona is still Famous Dave's where pay pretty much the same price, get to sit and relax while they serve you, and the food is better.  *Location = kinda out there*Price = for a cafeteria style bbq....I think it's a little much*Food = it's not all that...at least to us*Decor = very classic and full of character*** I just received a really nice message from the owner, Joe.  I think it's wonderful that Joe cares about each customer's comments and reviews.  Even though my review was not a very positive one, Joe was polite and very kind.  Thank you Joe and I think I'm definitely gonna persuade my bf to try your restaurant again :)***~~#~0
WOW!!! A real European bakery!  This was awesome, after having lunch next door at La Buona Pasta we took home some kalachi's and walnut roll home for later.  The cakes are varied and everything looks buttery good and sweet.  Having grown up near a Swedish bakery it kind of remind me of that--donuts, cakes, cheesecakes, breads and other European specialties.  The shop is also set up with a small section of Polish-centric groceries.  mmmm maybe I will have to learn to cook some Polish dishes.  Next special occasion my cake is coming from there.  :-)The one we visited is 13331 W. Indian School Rd.Litchfield Park, AZ 85340 USA623-547-4655~~#~1
I think if you go to Wendy's you know what you are getting into and compared to some of the other Wendy's it's pretty good. I've gotten food poisoning at Wendy's in my home town, so when i tried this place in Phoenix it was pretty good and didn't make me sick. Granted, it's never going to be perfect, this is fast good not fine dining.  In my personal experiences, I've never had a problem, but i think it varies from person to person.~~#~0
this place is awesome. GO. & soon - already decent wait times. OH, pitches of pbr for 7 bucks. yeah, yeah. shut up.GO GO GO.~~#~1
I was so happy when I saw this chain appear in AZ.  I used to frequent it in CA and have never found another sub that comes close.  I think the secret to their success lies in the freshness and quality of their meats and cheeses - always sliced to order.  If you are looking for a veggie sandwich - you will be limited here.  But, if you like a hearty cheesesteak or italian sub you are in for a treat.  They also take a bit of a different approach in that they really douse their sandwiches in oil & vinegar.   It is a different approach but seriously good!  The "Mike's Way" option (lettuce, onions & tomatoes) is a bit bland, I love to add the mustard, mayo & pepperocini.Their signature sandwich is the #13.  It has several flavorful italian meats plus freshly sliced cheese.  Don't judge this place until you have tried that sandwich!  It is unlike any other chain's offering & really amazing.  Their sandwich sizes are a bit different from the regular foot-long, but if you order the largest size you are getting quite a bit for your money.  I've visited the one that just opened in Chandler and was completely pleased.  And, I'm happy to hear they are now opening one in Ahwatukee.They also seem to have a high focus on customer service - I've always been met by very cheerful, helpful people.  Not a necessity for a sandwich, but certainly a lot better than the opposite.~~#~1
I have literally never seen this place open and I live two blocks away.~~#~1
This place was once known as J Chew and Company. I loved that place and this new version is still great.So comfy, so casual, so welcoming and so non-scottsdaley it's just the best.~~#~1
I'm not a fan of chains. I far prefer to find, and give my business to, new and interesting local fare. That said, there are a couple of chains I like and one is Texas Roadhouse.Texas Roadhouse does two things really well: steak and portions. I can go to a Texas Roadhouse anywhere and get a well-made ribeye at a very reasonable price. It made not be "fork tender" or the same quality as a $50 ribeye, but it'll only cost me $18 and I know it will be far superior to any other, more expensive, chain steakhouse. But before I get that steak, I'll get peanuts, bread, salad, and sides. So I'll likely have half a steak for lunch the next day.Like I said, well made steak and portions. I'm good with that.~~#~1
I made it home for two nights, and I would do it again. It is extremely close to ASU's campus. It was clean, people were friendly and I got a free ride to the airport. It was a great price; normal mid-range hotel with no amazing views. It has the amenities you need for a quick visit-including a pool and gym. The free continental breakfast is ok, especially if you just want cereal. I would not order bacon-not worth $2 extra.~~#~0
I picked up a jar of fresh-made salsa and chips for the Superbowl party I was attending last Sunday because they are that outstanding!  They were a big hit!  If you are dining at the Blue Adobe, definitely try the chips and salsa.  I am not a big fan of chipotle seasoning... it is definitely one of the key ingredients, but regardless I think it tastes great.  If you like it, you can buy a jar of the fresh salsa and take it home with you for about $9 (it is a good sized jar).~~#~1
The owner of Vermont Sandwich Co. just contacted me and offered to make right what happened to me during my last visit.  Nice gesture but I had to decline.  I didn't write what I did for a handout but I'm giving this place one more star for the offer.Vermont Sandwich Co is very highly rated.  For the owner to try to make right by one negative commenter among a multitude of positive, says something about the owner's integrity.I think a return visit to Vermont Sandwich Co. may be in order...~~#~0
This is by far my favorite Indian restaurant in the Phoenix area and the best!The food is very delicious and the owner, Preet, is very hospitable.Too bad I no longer live in Ahwatukee.  All I could think of when I was at a restaurant down the street from my place earlier, is how mouth-watering Star of India's chicken tikka masala is.... Yumm!A must visit!~~#~1
meh...... I'm torn.I found this store to be a little bit of a walking contradiction.(okay, not "walking" but you dig what I'm saying) Reminds me of myself in alot of ways....not all of which are good.  You see, I recycle EVERYTHING at work because the cute little receptacles are provided for me by waste management thus leading me to not actually think about what I'm doing. Plus, I co-manage a 26 story high rise mid-town and with the whole "green" movement, we'd be setting ourselves up for some major problems if we didn't comply with demand and of course, it does just "make sense".     At home, not so much and to be blunt I don't really think twice about it. (go on.....hate) This is how I feel about Fresh & Easy. Hybrid parking (fkn ridiculous) but no bike rack?? WTF??.....  Tons of bullshit organic produce and no preservatives  but then everything has been super sealed in some weird plastic containers. The F&E brand crapola that I tried was mediocre at best,  also,  it seemed like everything I picked up was within a day of expiration. I don't know about you F&E. We could be kindred sprits.... but two wrongs don't always make a right.~~#~0
Great quality food, atmosphere, and location. This is a place to take a date to or just to have an enjoyable evening with great food. The meatloaf (When they have it) is amazing. Steak is also top ofthe line.. Definitely recommend..~~#~1
What's all the fuss?  I'm not sure what folks compare this chain too? The Dead Duck Inn?  Joe's local Chinese Gag house? Are those places that great? Sooo fresh and delicious!? Not in my days? Pre-made sitting around and HEAVY oil is what I see from most other establishments. Even those touted by friends. Maybe it's because they know George from behind the counter.  It's not Pei Wei! Pei Wei is a quick, fresh and inexpensive gift from heaven. Even the hard to please Yelper has to admit, the multiple options you have to modify your meal should give you no excuse not to love what you order. The food is fresh and prepared to order. Even fried rice is made to order. The sauces are made from scratch and are a combination of quality Chinese ingredients. (Chili paste, fresh garlic, scallions, bean curd, and a bounty of fresh Chinese vegetables).  Go Yon China will serve you pre-made sauces with no punch and lots of giggle. The atmosphere at Pei Wei is great! Black and dark red with glossy graphics and all sorts of Chinese! Even with the "stand in line" style of dining. Makes me hungry just thinkin' about the joint. However, to me it's a take out Ferrari! Call in, swipe my card and off I go. Sure, it's not Chang's. Still, it's better than the local Dead Duck Inn's "food" stained art, with a Chinese New Year paper place mat. Of course! I'm looking at the healthier options a Chinese food place may have to offer, and Pei Wei lifts the bar in multiple sets! Get your chicken steamed, go brown rice, add extra vegetables or go vegetarian. Still you may complain..."Oh, is it too salty? Or too sweet?" Give me a break. This is CHINESE FOOD! And, you won't find MSG. So, if you don't want spicy, salty or sweet; have a meal from Bland of the Rising Sun. But, if you want a highly under rated treat...I ask you to open your mind to this familiar spot for clean, fresh, made to order and "if you like" healthy Chinese food!~~#~1
AMC Theaters has the distinct disadvantage in Phoenix at operating in a town with a high-quality, local provider of entertainment (Harkins) and they really pale in comparison. Tonight we went to the AMC 24 at Arizona Center, which is literally right near our house, but we've been there only two or three times in as many years. Why? Because AMC doesn't offer a senior discount any longer.For AMC Management -- Did you know that there is a huge population of older people living in condos in the downtown Phoenix location who go to moves three and four times a week? I think it is absolutely ridiculous that I could go to a Harkins and see a movie for $12-13 for two but when it's an AMC Theater, it's $20. Do they think they are so special that they warrant this extra "tax"?The theater is generally clean and nice, but the prices on sodas and popcorn are too high, combined with the fact that they don't offer the discount to seniors. AMC, please just fold up your tent and go away. We don't need you here.~~#~1
Bitzee Mama's isn't my mama! My mama wouldn't have kept her hungry son waiting forever for his lunch. She wouldn't have let my go thirsty with no refills. She does make a good bowl of salsa so that makes it alright, right? Took my real mama there for lunch.. I ordered the taco salad and ma ordered the cheese enchilada plate.. also a bowl or red chile. Taco salad was alright except the taco shell was so mushy from water it literally fell apart when I picked it up.. glad I wasn't eating the shell. She's old school.. makes a darn good cheese enchilada and refried beans. Struck out again with the red chile.. I swear, can no one except La Canasta make red chile? While the meat was tender and the sauce was smooth it had a weird orange color to it and the meat tasted, well wasn't any beef Ive ever had. On the way to the counter to pay my bill I noticed that almost everyone was eating chimichanga's.. well then, looks like I ordered the wrong thing! Place is also uber cheap. Be careful what you order and mama will be just fine.~~#~1
Is Jimmy single?  Cause if he is, I'd like to introduce myself.Nice local Italian spot.  Decent prices.Friendly service. Antipasta salad was great, lots of goodies for the money.  Meatballs and Italian sausage were okay bu the spicy sauce was great.I will be back to try the pizza, get another salad and ask if Jimmy is around.~~#~0
Went to try it out yesterday morning.  The service was so-so.  It wasn't crowded, and it took awhile for me to be noticed (and I'm 6'2", 275!)The Arbuckle's coffee was great.  Ordered the #2.....2 eggs, 2 pancakes, 2 sausage patties and 2 strips of bacon for $5.99.  Everything was fine except the sausage which had a peculiar flavor....the bacon strips were thick and tasty, the eggs okay, and the cakes were very good with an interesting touch....instead of the normal one glob of butter on top of the two cakes, there was one on top and one between the two cakes (made for easy buttering of the bottom cake).  All in all worth another try (might have been just an off day for the sausage).  Wish it were closer to home!~~#~0
Other than at grocery stores, it's becoming more and more difficult to find a simple, decent donut shop. And for some strange reason, there aren't any Dunkin Donuts in Chandler or Gilbert (can someone explain this phenomena to me?).  I know, for donut purists out there, Dunkin Donuts is just another corporate chain.  But I happen to think their donuts and coffee are pretty tasty!  That said, Bosa Donuts is nice alternative.  It's a small shop with a good variety of freshly made donuts.  I especially liked the chocolate frosted cake donuts.  They were really good.  The coffee was ok, let's say... better than "breakroom" coffee.  Located just north of the Downtown Chandler area, Bosa Donuts has both walk-in and drive-thru service 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.~~#~0
If you desire true Chicago deep dish pizza, then Nello's should be at the top of your list! This is a staple pizza location in the Valley- and my family has been going for years. Nello's offers a great menu, drink list, and atmosphere. They offer an excellent Mon-Fri lunch special - a large drink, salad and 2-topping personal pizza for $8.99- what a steal! Don't pass this place up, it's worth it.~~#~1
My house has never been this clean EVER!!! I am thrilled with the level of service and professionalism expressed by the women who cleaned my house today! I bought a Living Social coupon, and I am so glad I found this company. 5 women arrived and fully cleaned my house in 45 minutes. The women were friendly to me and especially my dog, which is the sign of a wonderful company, if you ask me. I am hoping I am able to use this service on a monthly basis. Angela scheduled my appointment immediately when I let her know I had company coming in town, and the cleaners arrived during the scheduled time. I am thrilled with the results!~~#~1
The Flower Studio far exceeded my expectations at my wedding! Christine is an amazing artist, businesswoman and person. She made time to meet with me outside her regular hours and really understood my vision for my wedding. Her arrangements for my wedding were absolutely stunning and really took the event to the next level. I am more than thrilled with this company and would recommend them to anyone. Thank you Flower Studio for making my wedding so beautiful.~~#~1
I dig the breakfast been to 7th and 38th and had Nan's breakfast, Plus have had tamales too so really is something to come back. In 13-years (I live in Cali) been here 26 times and not fancy (although 7th is the one with great pottery and colors inside. I ate 1 time for lunch of dinner and 25 times for brekafast~~#~1
Hybrid class!! Did it a few years back and to this day it's the best workout I've ever had. Will be going back FOR SURE~~#~1
I am not the biggest fan of fast food ever. But I really like Five Guys and this location is superb! They have really yummy fries and they give you so many! Like your bag overflows with the greasy buggers. Say what? Yeah they are really greasy. But good!The burgers are really quite the bang for your buck too! Not the best burgers in the world but it is fast food not gourmet burgers. Be considerate for what you are eating and enjoy it for what it is. The pop machines are radical. You can pretty much have flavoured any beverage you like. The staff here is really friendly and that is a plus anywhere you go!~~#~0
Super cool coffee bar with a great outdoor patio for little ones to run around!~~#~1
I've been here three times and have had terrific food each time.  The meat is incredible and their sauces are amazing.  Portion sizes are generous and the mac & cheese is delicious!  This is what BBQ is all about, definitely one of the best in Phoenix and we're lucky to have it here in the NW valley!~~#~1
As so many others, I found this place because of Guy on triple d. The room mate and I made the drive down one afternoon for some lunch hoping that the experience would make the 30 minute drive worth it. I was kind of surprised when we pulled up. From the outside it wasn't quite what I was expecting. The place is located in a strip mall and nothing really makes it stand out from the road...but figured maybe all the awesome was on the inside. We get inside and there are quite a few people. There aren't too many tables and almost all of them were taken. I grabbed the only one available that someone had been recently sitting at and just cleared some of the mess left on the table away. I stepped up to the counter and placed my order for a chicken chimi. It ended up taking a bit longer than I would have expected, but when the food came out it was pretty good. Let me say this now, I'm comparing this place to the Filabertos and Rudolphos and etc. With that in mind, this place is great. The flavor of the chicken is unlike any you would find at those other locations I mentioned. If you compare it to that of items found at other diamonds in the rough, I think it falls short. It is for that reason I give this place 3 stars. If I lived closer to this place I'd eat here on a regular basis I'm sure since the food is not at all bad and the prices are worth it, however I'm not sure why this place ended up getting a spot on triple d.~~#~0
Closed... GONE UNDER, OUTTA HERE.. See ya later, bye bye..~~#~1
I'd recommend this place highly for two situations:  1.) You are on the west side of town and you want some reasonably priced grub, 2.) You've never had Vietnamese food and you want to try it out in a non-intimidating environment.  For those two things, PA is awesome!   Nice people, decent food, and a very friendly environment. But their food doesn't stack up to the central Phoenix standard bearers.I suppose that their score is artificially low because of the category they are competing in.  Were they the only game in town, I suspect I would have rated them much higher - just to get my hands on a Bahn Mi every now and again.~~#~0
I have been going to Vatoci hair salon for over a year now. I've had the same stylist from day one and I highly recommend her. I've never had so many compliments on my hair! Ask for Marsha (Mirushe) and I guarantee she'll take amazing care of you. I love that she always remembers what we talk about and asks me about my job and my kids too. I am sure that Spiro and Vera also do a great job because the people who are in there when I am are regulars and everyone is always happy to be there. My daughter loved going in to be pampered as well, and they are amazingly flexible on scheduling appointments even though they always seem to have plenty of customers. They know what they are doing. Highly recommend!~~#~1
It was family day (the ex and I like to see our son smile) and we were starving... after driving around for a while we pulled up to Arriba's and said "what the hell..."That's also what we said when some of the food came, as in "what the hell is this??"So positive first.  The server was pretty quick and he gave refills without being asked.  Chips and salsa were good.  Chips were warm and salsa had a nice (suprising) kick.  Kick... do I sound like an old lady? Morgan and I ordered fish tacos and beef tacos, respectively, so we could swap one for one.  Fish was ok... nothing spectacular... but honestly I would rather pay for one at freakin Del Taco or Rubios.  Not worth it here.  Rice was ok, some flavor, probably converted rice though.  Beans were... blended?  I dunno about you but I like to see some actual BEANS in my beans!  This stuff was like brown goo... YUMMMMMMMM... :PThe beef taco was just weird.  I swear to God is tasted like gyro meat!  WTF?  I couldn't eat much of it.  Last but not least, Dom ordered the White Sands Chimichanga.  That sh*t looked nasty to be honest.  Covered with some gooey white sauce, filled with pork.  LOL, he said it tasted like hot dog.  Um, yikes!  He took about 2 bites and was "full".  A.K.A., he didn't like it.I also had a margarita... it was HUGE and didn't taste very good.  I'd rather have one 1/4 that size that tasted nice.  Oh well.One star for the chips and salsa.  Like I said, the fish taco was okay, but every thing was just way over-priced!  Final verdict?  We decided to NEVER go there again.~~#~1
Meh.I went to Big Bang a lot during the peak of my ASU bar hopping days, but never fell in love with the place. It was (still is?) one of the only bars on Mill that charges cover. I don't recall any decent drink specials; domestic beers only. Of course, everyone's in love with the dueling pianos. Sure it's fun when you're inebriated, but gets old fast. I hear the exact same songs every time I go. I personally guarantee you'll hear 'What I Got' and  'Sweeeeeeet Caroline' at least once.Overall, a solid veteran of the Mill Ave scene.~~#~0
Kona grill is never a disappointment.  Sushi, the regular menu, the atmosphere.....  The staff is very friendly and the food is very good!  We like to create our own sushi dishes and the chef is always ready and willing!  I highly recommend Kona Grill for consistently good food!~~#~1
I love this place, I want to go to Arizona just to eat here!  The greek fries were really good and different.  It was just really really good. We're going next time I'm in town Fervor!~~#~1
"If you buy half a duck, you don't get to pick which duck."I lived in China, mainly Guangdong, for three years, and all it really took was a look at this sign, along of course with all the wonderful roasted ducks and pork, to know I had come across a place with bona fides. Hope Kee has some of the very best Chinese food in town, in my opinion, and is worth the trip from wherever it is in the valley that you live. I don't know anywhere else in town you can get such good congee, which is actually called "zhou" or "jook," and which is a soupy, delicious rice porridge.  They're also one of the only places you can get dried scallop soup, which they do an excellent job of. Dried scallops, a specialty of HK/Guangdong, are one of the most delicious things in the world. Everything that they make is delicious, and sitting in there listening to the customers and staff talk in Chinese and Cantonese can really take you back to China, if you've had the pleasure of spending time there. Otherwise it's just about as close as you can get. If you want to eat some real Chinese food that is both delicious and approachable, and very reasonably priced, you can't beat Hope Kee. Get some soup or some congee, some clams with black bean sauce, some greens and some BBQ, and you'll see why China and Hope Kee are such hard places to stay away from. If you do decide to try your hand at duck-picking and buy a whole duck, fear not for wasted leftovers, because roasted duck makes for a very tasty soup.~~#~1
We ate here last weekend and it was nice.  The wait was long but if you've never eaten there it's worth waiting for.  Once you get in there you'll see it's a fun place to be; a combination of hip/50's dinner with real all American food (especially breakfast).  I had the salami and eggs breakfast which was ok.  I thought the salami was way too salty.  The hash browns on the other hand are amazing.  They were made from real potatoes, cooked just right with plenty of grease and I loved every bite!  I also had a cup of coffee that was average at best.  My wife, on the other hand, had a glass of lemonade that was made from scratch and was sweetened with honey which we both thought was awesome.  If you're going to come here bring a small snack you can munch on outside because the wait could be up to an hour and a half.  Best thing is to call before you come and ask how long the wait is.~~#~0
How can something so simple taste sooo good? I wish there were one more on the west side. I hate going to the fair to get my fix of fry bread. There needs to be one of these on every  corner of the compass in Phoenix! As Rachel Ray would say, "Yummy!"~~#~1
This was the most HORRIBLE floor cleaning I have ever seen!!!!! We took before and after pictures and cannot tell the difference at all! The guy was not friendly and just wanted our money even though he did not do his job! I would NEVER recommend this company to anyone. We paid $1000 and got $20 worth of service. I mopped the floor the day after the cleaning guy was here and got a lot of the "staining as he would say" off easily. I have included a picture that we wrote in the floor with a paper towel after the cleaning....can you read the saying? That is exctaly how we felt after the service. REALLY?!?!?~~#~1
This is my first time trying this place and I had a wonderful experience. The place was packed and yet they got me in right away. A young man gave me a pedicure and did a spectacular job. They even put on a timer for 15 mins to ensure I got a full massage during it. They offered the other services but did not force any on me. I will definitely use them again and recommend the place to others.~~#~1
I'm in agreement with Anandita: If you've got to shop at a Whole Foods, this is the one. The only attitude I got was from a couple cougaresque velour-tracksuited shoppers, not from the staff (who were all refreshingly down-to-earth and friendly).If you're straying from mainstream essentials, they are surprisingly price competitive (or even cheaper than) mass-market grocers. For "normal" food it's still Whole Foods and still often inordinately expensive. Their meat department usually makes me laugh.But if you're looking for something weird enough even Sprouts doesn't carry it, chances are Whole Food not only has it but has an employee who can tell you all about it.~~#~0
The best staff around! Very friendly and always make sure you are satisfied with your food. The food is great as well. From breakfast to lunch, and healthy shakes like Fast Fuel, you can get it here. Very clean too!~~#~1
Im a sucker for great libations and the stores that can carry the works.. Zinfandel for me.. Magners for my boy.. ( a great Irish cider we fell in love with in SF)..great tequilas.. all types of wines.. you get my sniffster...~~#~1
Wow! The Penang Curry (chicken) was absolutely incredible!! The portion was huge...had enough left over for another meal and tasted just as good the 2nd day. I will definitely be back! The Thai Tea was very good also. I just wish it was closer to Gilbert!~~#~1
Donuts are really good, if they have any when you get there!!!  Went in on a Tuesday morning at 1030, and they only had a total of 10 donuts. Drove out of my way to go there and still ended up at Dunkin Donuts. Very disappointed!!~~#~1
I'm a huge fan of Padre's! What food I've tried (I mainly just order tacos or their pork sliders usually) is delicious, the bartenders are awesome, and the owners are always friendly!One of my favorite things to do: Order two tacos and half a bowl of guacamole with chips and salsa.~~#~1
This place is absolutely wonderful. My boyfriend and I have been here for a few special occasions and have never been dissappointed, the food is amazing and the service is just as good, our waiter was so unbelievably nice. Their steak could possibly be the best steak I have ever eaten, and their creme brulee is to die for. This place even does complimentary filet mignon sandwiches for happy hour...guarantee you will love this place just as much as we do!~~#~1
I am a Regus member and could get wait here since I could use my membership card.Its a great place situated on 3rd floor with awesome city view. Complimentary menu is refreshing. Cordial staff. Quiet and relaxed environment.Many TV screens and seatings to get comfortable with.~~#~1
its HOTin the valley in the summer time and QT lives up to its name- ONE STOP DRINK SHOP! HEAVEN in the summer time and the price is unbeatable!~~#~1
I went to this place on a friend's recommendation, but have only eaten the custard. The lemon is quite refreshing and fluffy although I wish is was a little less sweet. This is a great place to visit after a light meal in downtown Mesa if you are looking to satisfy your sweet tooth, but not go overboard. The service is fantastic and the parking is ample as they have a private lot. The inside of the restaurant is quite charming and diner like. If you are really looking for the full experience of frozen custard, eat it outside in the never-ending, relentless Arizona sun...you will truly feel the refreshment!~~#~0
As a frequent antiques consumer, I can honestly say that Lizabel's Treasures is my favorite antique store in Phoenix. I've been a customer for several years, and Lizabel's is my first (and often only) stop.Why Lizabel's is such a treasure is because of these things: price, desirable antiques, and great customer service. John and Bette know what people want, and they go to great lengths to get the antiques that people want and to make their customers happy. I'm a believer.They consistently have one-of-a-kind quality furniture and pieces that you would not normally find elsewhere in town. Pieces are priced very agreeably, so you can afford to stock up or furnish a whole room without busting the bank.John and Bette have created the kind of family business that is to be admired. They have a legion of supportive customers, and I'm one of them. I can always find them to be helpful and interested in getting me what I want, even if I don't always know what I want.Lisabel's Treasures is the place to build a relationship with, because as one's life's needs changes, so does the need for different pieces and furniture. I can always count on finding something I really love at their store, and you will, too.~~#~1
Very typical mexican food. nothing special.~~#~0
In a sentance: Four Peaks is DEFINATLY something to write Yelp about! From the moment I realized that there were more reviews about this place than I'd care to read in one sitting, I knew this was going to be good!! I realized it was going to be fantastic when i pulled up with my friend Darius and we had a hard time finding a parking spot at 3pm. We met a friend for lunch and the place was laid back, chill, clean, cozy and yet modern - perfect. I had the French Dip, thinly sliced roast beef on a nice hogie bun. Everything was good not too salty not too greasy, loved it! Darius got the Fish N Chips and it was incredible!! Crispy batter dipped big pieces of fish, iot was crispy and crunchy but soft and delightful on the inside. The chips were also batter dipped and had great flavor. I was in love! this is my best recommendation for a meal at Four Peaks!To my yelpers i say: there is limited parking, so when you pull up and see nothing but cars lining the street, do NOT be alarmed! there will be a table available! Another thing, get the fish n chips! It's duh-vine!~~#~1
I was so looking forward to breakfast here. What a disappointment.The food is the only thing that rates any stars at all. Good ingredients cannot be completely ruined by incompetent service.The space is nice, but crowded and loud. The counter staff were indifferent. After being waved over to an open register, the fellow behind the counter took one order, then wandered off, leaving the rest of us to get back in line at the other register to order.You are given a number (or not) and left to find your own table, scrounge up your own silverware, and wait for your food to be delivered. Except that the napkins are at a completely different station than the silver, they were out of forks, and most of the tables were completely filthy. I watched a busboy randomly swipe the top of a table, sweeping crumbs onto the benches and chairs, then leave an empty drink bottle on the table before wandering listlessly off.Beverages are (apparently) serve yourself, although they didn't bother to say that when I ordered. I stood at the counter, waiting for iced tea, only to turn around and see that I was expected to get it myself.If they happen to "run out of numbers", then they input your name with your order. Nothing irritates me more than to have my name shouted across a restaurant. Better yet, the waiters wander from table to table looking for their customers.... "Lisa? Is there a Lisa here?" while your food cools. Inexcusable.The only bright point: the croque madame was tasty. Delicious bread, ham, and a perfectly fried egg. But the meager smear of bechamel and a thin slice of cheese were underwhelming. However, the "side of fruit" made me angry: a tiny metal creamer with 1 blackberry, a few slices of strawberry, and 2 chunks of  green apple. Insulting.Fast casual, order at the counter works well when tables are clean and set, and the food delivery is speedy and efficient. Unfortunately this place needs some work in order to make it worth your time.~~#~1
May have great food but I'll never know. Ordered delivery and the chef who doesn't speak English couldn't find my apartment complex even when I walked out to the street right next to the 101 far away. He said he was there but couldn't tell me where he was. Talked to him on the phone for ten minutes then hung up on me when I guess he got frustrated and wouldn't answer my calls back. Called to order food for my visiting family and was glad to find this place but that chef is awful. The owner apologized to me profusely and that was a nice gesture but waiting an hour for a guy who hangs up on you and can't find a place looking at the 101 exit is ridiculous. Don't use them for delivery ever, call the Breakfast Joynt. Their owner is awesome and delivers to you himself. Plus, he actually knows the area. Cannot express my frustration with this restaurant's service. Do not use EVER~~#~1
This is my kind of restaurant. I love everything about Buca di Beppo!I am fascinated by how this place was decorated. All the walls and various trinkets make this a fun dining experience. One thing to note is that it can be kind of expensive to eat here, although I am always finding coupons for this restaurant so that helps!Beyond that the food is awesome! I go with my fiance and we love the calamari and the garlic bread, which we always get as appetizers. We switch up the main course when we go, but each time has had great results. We had dessert here once too and that was also good! We usually end up with leftovers, because they give huge portions, which we love. I can't wait to come again!~~#~1
I hate ordering flowers sight unseen, but needed a local florist for a sympathy arrangement. Rachel immediately alleviated any concern when we discussed what I wanted in detail, and she even emailed me a photo of the final arrangement. Gorgeous flowers, same day delivery and reasonable pricing - can't beat that.~~#~1
Well, I cannot believe I have waited this long to give an update on Morgan!!  Especially since she is FANTASTIC!!  Yes, I have been back to her for the 5th time now and I love what she suggested I do to the color on my hair (much better than what I was doing) and her haircuts are the best.  She also has done some other treatments on my hair that have made it hold up under this hard, dry AZ weather.  And, she is so sweet and caring.  Oh, she has also gone out of her way to make an introduction to another of her clients (also from the South) who was new here and had not met many people and we really hit it off.  Morgan knew we would.  I mean what more can you ask for.........go for it...YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY.   This from a HAPPY, HAPPY Client, Christine~~#~1
Beautiful parish, also home to the amazing Legacy Ballroom that is available for wedding receptions and events.  The annual Middle East food festival is a wonderful family event with fantastic food, pastry, and entertainment!~~#~1
Pancit palabok here is best outside of the Philippines. Anyone can enjoy a quiet peaceful dinner on a Friday night~~#~1
My food was delicious and the waitress were nice! They didn't bother me every 5 minutes and I was able to enjoy my meal. Spicy does mean spicy here though!~~#~1
I think this is the second time I've ever been to a Chili's...actually I'm not even sure if it's the second....it could be the first time I've been to a Chili - I think the other time it was Apple Bee's or something like that...anyways yeah well yesterday night my bf and his friend and I finally went to this place called JumpStreet - to jump our fat away  - but after that we got really hungry and it was around 9ish and after in Arizona closes pretty early but luckily Chili's closes at 10 so we were able to get a table and eat a fatty meal.They had a $20 dollar for 2 meal deal - in which for two people you pick a appetizer and 2 entree from their list - super good deal! We decided for the Tostada Chips and Fire-Grilled Corn Guacamole for the appetizer - it's good, however I didn't like the chips because it was very thin and was a bit oily - the guacamole was good and had a hint of spiciness to it. For the entree I had the Quesdilla Explosion Salad - interesting name and very tasty too except that I forgot to tell them to put the dressing on the side cause they put a little more dressing than I would like. The salad consisted of grilled chicken, cheese, tomato, corn-relish, cilantro, and tortilla strips tossed with a citrus-balsamic dressing and on the side four triangular cheese quesdilla! mMmm super delish! My bf ordered the margarita grilled chicken served with rice and black beans, tortilla strips and pico de gallo - doesn't look really good but it tastes okay.Despite being a chain restaurant, the food is not bad and the prices are definitely a bit cheaper than other big chain American family restaurants.~~#~0
Amazing facility. Scottsdale healthcare has done a great job, the people are happy to work here unlike some hospitals. They are very receptive and the ER operates like clockwork.~~#~1
My street cred is that I'm from the South. You know, home of fried things. I think I know a thing or two about fried chicken and sweet tea.Understand the whole concept of being quaint and family-run, but seriously didn't think it lived up to all the hype.I ordered some sweet tea. I was mondo thirtsy and couldn't wait to wrap my hands around that mason jar. Holy guacamole! The sweet tea tasted like a cavity waiting to happen. I was tempted to order a lemonade to make an Arnold Palmer, but feared that it would be overly sweet versus tart. Instead, I requested a glass of water and some lemons to help with the sugar ratio. I still couldn't get it to taste "normal" and sort of just abandoned it. I had the Lo-Lo entree which consisted of 3 small pieces of dark chicken and 2 waffles. I also ordered a side of mac & cheese - cause I'm dirty like that. I thought for sure the food would be the saving grace...hells nah! Chicken was aight, but hardly any meat. The mac-and-cheese was just okay. Kind of reminded me of stuff you can get from Luby's. If it weren't for the waffles, I'd be hungry. I pretty much ate my waffles and stole my friend's fried okra - which WAS good. I dunked some of my chicken into her side of gravy and SHAZAAM it was like licking a salt mine!Needless to say, we had a rather lengthy wait before our food arrived and while I do appreciate the hole-in-the-wall appeal - I was disappointed nonetheless. Sometimes you just can't believe the hype!~~#~0
Amazing.This is often called the largest mall in Arizona, and it shows. Each time I've done the usual "mall walk" I've easily lost a few hours trying to see it all. It's true that this isn't a place for anyone that doesn't care about fashion - but this is a mall that's true to its name. "Fashion Center" is no joke here. Lots of high-end designer stores, lots of mid-range affordable fashion stores, and a few random familiar stops like Hallmark and Pottery Barn-esque stores scattered through there. A decent food court, with a theater also conveniently down there. (But after spending so many hours at the mall, who has time for a movie?)You can easily drop a few thousand here, so be forewarned if you're on a budget. Also, I almost wish I had a map in my pocket, because it can get confusing to remember which hallways you've already explored. And wear some comfortable walking shoes, because it's not easy to get in and get out of this one. But there's a good number of parking to use in a garage or few - when you remember where you parked the car. I'd take any out-of-towner here, unless they had a grudge against fashion, classy stores, or walking.~~#~1
This go around I opted for the bacon egg and cheese breakfast burrito (served all day!) and lengua (tongue), cabeza (head, and cheek meat), and carnitas (roasted pork) tacos.  The breakfast burrito was the tastiest, bacon filled treat I have ever had! I love bacon, and if you don't love it as much as I do, the bacon overload may be too much, I swear there might be more bacon than egg in this bacon bomb!I should have figured that with a price of $2.50 per taco they would be slightly bigger than the average taqueria taco.  The size of these things are gAstronomical, and the flavor of each are equally proportional, the lengua, however,  would've probably been better if it hadn't been sitting in the cold whilst I ate the other three items!I will no longer be eating carne asada at this place when I have the option of carnitas, cabeza, lengua, or bacon.  I advise you to do the same!~~#~1
First of all, I have to say you cant beat the price here.  $6 Pho, come on now!!However, I wasn't too fond of the food itself.  I mean, it was OK but not "I have to drive 45 minutes just so I can come here to eat lunch" good.  We happen to be in the area and Yelp showed us the way.  The spring roll was meh ... not super fresh but it wasn't unfresh either.  Hard to explain but I definitely wouldn't get it again here and the peanut sauce was actually not good at all.  I was really disappointed with the sauce.I ordered their meat pho and the flavor was good.  I definitely think the place is good enough to try but when we are in the area - which is not often - we'll prob find another pho joint to try out.  For the price and "ok" food, you will enjoy.~~#~0
I eat a lot of Asian food (of different sorts).  Asian is actually my go-to cuisine since I have a lot of food allergies.  This place deserves a thumbs-down, unless you love Americanized Asian.  The food was bland, breaded and just not worth any money.  Next time I'm in Phoenix, I definitely won't eat here.~~#~1
Followed a Dr. that I respect to this practice and I have to say I'm pretty impressed. As a long time multi-four-footed caregiver, I have seen more than my share of veterinary clinics and animal hospitals. I know the drill and have seen more than one vacation be sucked in to the great black hole of "well of course I want  to have the best care". The first thing I noticed is that there is NO odor. It doesn't smell like there have been decades of animals paraded through the doors that feel the need to pee as soon as they enter the room... just in case this is their one last shot at leaving something behind. Then there is the overall feel of the place. The office I used to frequent always had a frenetic sort of feel to it. Files were lost, techs were running, the waiting room was packed with stressed out clients, etc. This office was peaceful. Whether is natural or contrived, I could care less. My dog picked up on it immediately and her normal "OMG what are we doing HERE?!!" behavior was replaced with something I've never witnessed in a vet office before. She was calm! It's clean! Except for the area around me that was covered in the undercoat that Zoe was stress releasing, there were no traces of other animals. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. I had a HUGE file that I was bringing in and they patiently sorted through the entire thing. While I was there for one of my pets, the receptionist offered to set all of them in my household up for me with "Client Files" so that I wouldn't have to be bothered in the future. I thought that was a wonderful, time-saving offer and in the event that I ever have to go with an emergency and am not able to focus on paperwork. Finally, I was in an examination room at the time of my appointment and waited less than 3 minutes for both the tech and the Dr. I was in an out under 1 hour and that my friends is superior service IMHO. I look forward to a long relationship with Palm Glen and will happily drive the 5 mile difference from my old vet, in order to ensure both my pets and I are treated well!~~#~1
This place is pretty incredible.  The california club and the breakfast buzz are probably the best items on the menu IMO... but seriously, you can't go wrong.  The only thing I've had that I didn't really care for is the Breakfast Burrito, but that was because it was just a little boring compared to the other choices on their menu.  It's a long wait in the drive thru 99% of the time, but it is absolutley MORE than worth it.~~#~1
even after 1.5 hours wait i loved the atmosphere and did not mind the wait at all. the service was good. not too friendly but everything we needed was on table. Disappointment was domestic Kobe burger. it was served overdone (just little pink in center after i ordered it medium - rare) it is served with Asian slaw ( peanut dressing) which is served on top of the burger. It was way too strong and it took away from the burger itself. it was hard to taste the meat with so much peanut sauce in the slaw. If i was to order this dish again, i would ask for slaw on the side. the fries were fantastic and fried cheese was very good. i will definitely be back for more for my friends loved their burgers. the 3 stars is for the fact that burger was way overdone and i could not taste the major component to that dish - Meat!~~#~0
It's a freeway.Traffic sucks near downtown but the views are nice through Dreamy Draw.I think I just saw Kurdy passing by!~~#~0
Cadillac Ranch looked really awesome from the outside, this nice red cadillac out front, nice patio outside, and an enclosed bar and grill patio on the side. Upon entering it was pretty dead, well, it was a Monday afternoon after all.I ordered the Southwestern Country Fried Steak, huge plate of food that came with your choice of House Salad or Ceaser Salad. I dove into the mashed potatos, which upon their many options of how you want your potatos to taste (garlic, cheese, horshradish, etc), I picked garlic - always go safe at a first time resturaunt! The gravy was very bland, I ended up putting more salt on it. The potatos were the only thing salty and flavored on my plate. They had also put diced garlic in the mix, not roasted, but raw garlic. I love garlic, but I can't eat whole cloves (horrible headaches) like some of those awesome people can out there, so it was kinda a downer there. The two pieces of country fried steak was actually steak, but the very fatty piece of steak that you should never buy, cook, and serve.Since I came with friends and family, it seemed the only thing they could put flavor in was the deep fried dishes. My mother ordered the Fish and Chips, they were slightly on the dark side, the fish wasn't fishy but slightly bland, the cocktail sauce was the only thing that saved the fish from being totally neglected lol. The fries were really good though! My friend had ordered the same thing, I think she wasn't complaining was because she had ordered mamosa's lol.Service-wise, it was slow, but don't expect to be waited on asap on a dead Monday.I think the only thing that tasted good was the Ice Cream Fudge Brownie, but that single dish alone won't help this review get to two stars.All in all, eat at the other different eateries at Tempe Marketplace, I think Cadillac Ranch would be the last resort place if you can't get in to another popular resturaunt at the time.~~#~1
Well look at that. We went to this Dunkin on Sunday and they didn't mess up our order terribly. I was greeted by the afternoon staff, and they were quite nice. Yeah, they couldn't get the order right the first time, but they worked with me to make sure they got it right at the window. That's all I ask for. Is that too much to ask? Apparently it is for morning crew. Not afternoon. Solid, not terrible experience.~~#~0
Love this place!  Went for a stay-cation with the girls for a spa day and stayed the night.  I can't wait to go back!  You are in the city but feels miles away!  The spa is amazing!  Wonderful adults only pool with great refreshing food and drinks.  Then our rooms were clean and comfortable.  Dinner at Kai was nothing short of superb, and breakfast the next morning on the patio over looking the golf course and pool area was also very good.  Overall a wonderful night away.~~#~1
Had a decent lunch here the other day with my co-workers.  We go here often for happy hour after work.The food was pretty decent.  The lunch menu is oddly full of mostly non-mexican style food.  That was odd.Service was ok until it got a little busy.  Then my cup was more half empty than half full.~~#~0
just another big store with everything everywhere.~~#~0
This is my favorite place to go for Greek food. The owners are from Greece and frequently several family members are present.The food is delicious, large portions, friendly service. I wish they were located in Surprise, but they are worth the drive.~~#~1
I have been here multiple times and each time the staff has been superb.  Their selection is also awesome.  I would highly recommend.~~#~1
decent.  the potstickers were kind of good.  I didn't really know what to expect.  it met my expectation.  the lychee pork was good and deserved the second helping.  the selection was impressive.  and the stuffed mushrooms had an interesting stuffing.  spam, was it?  some sort of sausage or other processed meat that made it quite a delightful surprise.~~#~0
Okay, so I like Canteen and all, but dear Lord, let's turn that music down a notch! These guys have a great happy hour, but I realistically wouldn't come here if it weren't for that. I quite enjoy the small bites' baby back ribs - the portions are so small, but since they are half price during happy hour, I get two orders! I'm not a big fan of Tequila, but I know they have a big selection (obviously). I really like the atmosphere here, and the service has always been good. I may or may not come back, but we'll see. Three solid stars from me.~~#~0
Huge store, friendly staff~~#~1
My car looks better than it did the day I bought it!~~#~1
OMG this place is good. Great Italian beef. Great burgers. FRY SAUCE. I don't know how they're pulling off such good food with what they have but it's awesome and I will be eating here if I'm in the area and hungry.~~#~1
I love my eye doctor!  Platonically, of course.  The entire staff is relaxed, friendly, easy going, and personable.  No one ever makes you feel rushed but instead take time to make sure that everything is okay, that you've thought of everything, gotten all of your questions answered, and had plenty of time to make decisions and think.  The doctor takes time to get to know you and to talk about how you use your eyes (staring at the computer, sports, etc).  The assistants try to think of things from your point of view so they can volunteer useful information and ask a lot of specific questions while doing so.  This place treats you like family.  There's a broad range of styles, but mostly, they're fashionable frames.  When I go in, I see a lot of kids, young adults, and 20 and 30-somethings as well as the older patients who so often come to need glasses.  Horwitz costs a little more than the mall chains, but my prescriptions have been consistently better thanks to the doctor taking time, the lenses are much higher quality, and the frames are worlds better in terms of availability of things that aren't ugly and durability.~~#~1
Treated with complete disrespect. Worst service I have ever experienced.  After waiting to see the manager I was directed to an employee who committed slander towards me very loudly in front of everyone in the store. Then the manager stepped in, spoke robotically without listening and then was incredibly harsh in tone and told me to leave. He said, "leave, get out, now" ****************Don't go to this store/don't use verizon******************~~#~1
Always treat me well, very honest!!~~#~1
One of my top choices for downtown Phoenix. Always an upscale, posh vibe, but with very generous prices on entrees. Good looking people throughout this bar. The Kisras are VERY tasty and a good spin off the typical flatbreads at many restaurants now. Brunch here on Saturdays or Sundays-- great drink specials too.~~#~1
Great atmosphere and food. We keep coming back!~~#~1
Most amazing service! The food is common pho and buns but the main attraction is what drew me in it's not your typical Vietnamese restaurant it's a SPRING ROLL BAR!! Fantastic drinks! Great addition~~#~1
Ahhh, Four Peaks.  By far my favorite restaurant in Phoenix.  This place is fantastic as far as brew pubs go - great beer and great food to go with it.  I can't believe I haven't taken the time to review it yet...The Beer: pretty consistently awesome.  All the beers are at least "good," my favorites being 8th Street Ale and their IPAs (Hop Knot and Raj).  I have to say the Kiltlifter is a tad overrated, but still pretty solid, and worth a try.  I've been meaning to try one of their cask conditioned ales, but they always seem to be out, probably indicative of the quality of those selections.The Food: fantastic!  I can't say that I've ever had a bad meal at Four Peaks.  The Italian Beef Beer Bread is the best thing on the menu, but you can't go wrong with the Chicken Fingers, Chicken Salad Pita, or really any of their sandwiches.  The fries are also great here - there's a little crispy coating on the outside that is quite tasty.  Oh, and the Spicy Thai Hummus is also a really good appetizer.  A little more liquidy than your average hummus, but really good.  It has a nice little kick to it that will have you reaching for your beer.Bottom line, if you live in Phoenix, like beer, and enjoy eating a good meal, then you should be shot if you don't like Four Peaks.  If you haven't been yet, do yourself a favor and try it.  You'll come away happy, I promise.~~#~1
Popped in for a quick meal before a show. Fun decor, brand new and sparkling clean, with a nice sized menu. We chose this restaurant because it advertised gluten free pasta. Unfortunately, no one on staff seemed to know what "gluten free" meant. When we asked which sauces might be GF to go with the GF pasta, we were met with blank stares. It took several questions to determine that the marinara sauce "might" be GF -not very confidence inspiring. When we did get our meals, everything tasted fine, not fabulous, about on par with a Pei Wei type experience. I had a small side house salad, which was not on the menu, but was offered by the girl at the register.  The greens were nice, but not chilled, which was kind of yucky.  The balsamic vineagrette was not able to be GF certified, so I had it on the side.  It was just OK.  My GF pasta was cooked properly, and the portion was large but not too large.  I had the primavera with marinara sauce, and while the veggies seemed fresh, they were a tad overcooked.  My husband had a pizza, seemed to be pretty good.  My daughter had a kids meal of chicken tenders and fries--the tenders were a chicken breast cut into slices, which worked, and the fries were a tad bit reminiscent of Burger King's, with some parmesan thrown on top.  The kid's meal also came with mini donuts, which we had to ask for 3 times, but there were fresh out of the fryer and covered in cinammon sugar--yummy.  We ordered ice cream with a GF chocolate chip cookie--and what arrived was definitely not a "cookie"--more like a gluey, gooey chocolate chip amoeba at the bottom of a dish with 2 scoops of ice cream on top.  Eh.I tried to order an espresso machiato at the coffee bar in back of the restauant--the coffee girl didn't know the correct way to make the drink, so I opted for a soy cappucino--this was tasty and well done.This is clearly a new business still working out the kinks. I think it's a good option if you're in downtown PHX and need a quick, decent meal.~~#~0
I've been going here many years.The food is always very, very good. Soups are fantastic, sandwiches are hearty and flavorful, and the service is excellent. Prices are reasonable and the food quality and quantity is probably the best bang for the $ you'll get in a place like this, anywhere I've been - and I travel a lot.I really cannot think of a single thing I can fault this place for.~~#~1
omg... I love this place the food is great, the selection is great, the staff is very helpful. This  is a great place to go have a few drinks and great stir fry.~~#~1
I love this place.  The family is very sweet and the food is real deal homecooked Cuban food ... as good as I remember eating in Havana.  I love the Fricase de Pollo and my hubby loves the oxtail.  The fruit juices/smoothies are delish too!~~#~1
In short... great view, really expensive food.~~#~0
What to choose, what to choose. Such difficult decisions! Seriously, this normally isn't a problem. Dispite the fact that I'm a libra, I'm very decisive. Friends usually look to me to make all sorts of decisions ::diabolical laugh:: Still, this place consistently stumps me.Is it Tuesday? If yes, then I'm definately getting the Pork Belly Tacos.Otherwise, I'll start with an order of Ceviche and Asado Salad.To drink I'll have Agua Fresca de Sabor.Yes, I'm going to have an entre too, I mean I've already broken my diet, might as well :DI'll have the Huevos Rancheros or 3 Carne Asada Tacos or the Verduras de Temporada or the Chilaquiles Verdes or the Carne Asada Torta. OMG, so many great options! Seriously, this normally isn't a problem. Oh well, I guess I'll just have to try everything.Next up, a euphoric food coma! Life is good.~~#~1
I can say that I used to love the place. Not so much any longer. Went over there this past Sunday at 7pm. Crowded, but still room to sit 6 of us. Here are a few simple notes to sum up the evening.Waitress was on something. She was walking, but out of it. Forgot our order twice, and both times could not remember even taking them. Very bizarre. Girl next table fell over and out of her chair. No one really even seemed to notice, maybe that happens often here now. Place looks tired, worn out, especially the fabric on the chairs and booths outside. If you squint, you can see the old Vig, when it seemed spotless, and shiny. Now a bit tattered, along with the staff. If you are over 28, then I would have to say you might feel old in here. Reminds me of a spring break crowd being filmed by an MTV crew in Cabo. Very young, very drunk.~~#~0
After reading all the good reviews, we were looking forward to eating here, but we were a bit apprehensive due to the couple of bad reviews because of the smell. Bummer...the smell just killed it for us right from the get go. Immediately, upon walking in the door, the pungent smell of backed up sewer hit us like a ton-of-bricks. We did a 180 and walked right out. No way I could sit through a meal here while breathing that funk. Get the smell worked out and we will give you another shot, Tasty Thai.~~#~1
my husband and i LOVE this place! no, we cannot afford to get our weekly groceries here (although it would be terrific if we could), but we view oakville as an excellent alternative to dining out on the weekend. the food is delicious (think deli, simplicity, quality ingredients), and the atmosphere is comfortable and relaxing! we found that if it's too crowded inside, then it's easy enough go outside to the awesome patio area to enjoy our beer and goodies :)~~#~1
HORRIBLE---no, NON-EXISTENT customer service!  Which is a shame considering they have good pizza.  I ordered 2 pizzas, wings, a 2 liter and extra ranch; an hour later, the delivery guy showed up with 1 pizza and wings.  When I told him that the order was not complete, he just rolled his eyes and rudely informed me their online ordering was "messed up".  Then shoved the pizza and wings at me without apologizing or offering to correct the mistake.  Problem was, I had already been charged for the whole order so I was not about to take less than half of what I paid for.  I told him to cancel the order and he turned and stomped away without another word.  I immediately called the store to make sure I would be credited for my screwed up order that the delivery guy made no attempt to correct.  I asked for the manager when they answered.  The girl who answered said to someone in the background (without putting me on hold so I heard every word): "Someone wants a manager.  I guess that is you."  The  "manager" told her he didn't have time to talk to customers and proceeded to yell at her about all the work he had to do....uh- FYI buddy, customers are THE REASON YOU ARE IN BUSINESS so it would be a good idea to make time for them!!!! The poor girl came back to the phone after being totally berated by the manager, and I told her what had happened with my order. She offered to credit my card for the order.  Only problem is, it takes 48 hours to process.  So now I am out $40 for the next few days, I have waited over an hour and still have no dinner, and I was treated horribly by not one (delivery driver) but two (manager) Mama Mia employees.  I told the girl on the phone that the delivery guy and manager should not treat customers so rudely, she apologetically agreed.  I asked for the contact information of the owner; if this were my business, I would want someone to let me know if my employees were treating customers like dirt.  She could not provide the contact information but offered to call someone named Frank and have him call me back to resolve the situation.  I never received a call.  Apparently, the "customers are not important" tone is set at the top in this business.  There are lots of good pizza places in Phoenix, save yourself the hassle and the headache, order from somewhere that actually knows the meaning of customer service.~~#~1
I just ordered the 'hamburger' then added my favorite toppings.Another excellent burger, I have to say! Plenty of meat, freshly made - and hot off the grill!Top notch fries as well, overflowing from the cup they put it in.  It takes about 5 - 10 minutes to get a great, fresh burger like this - but is very much worth the wait!~~#~1
A friend was visiting from out of town and we decided we wanted a pampering experience.  So, rather than go to my neighborhood mani/pedi place, we went over to old town scottsdale for lunch and a (we hoped) luxurious pedicure.  This place looked very promising, and the lady at the front really talked them up, so we took the plunge.  Everything seemed promising . . . we waited in a lovely outdoor area until they were ready for us.  Then . . . disappointment.  The pedicure was nothing I couldn't get for half the price, the massage chairs just vibrated, my feet were still a little rough afterward, and the paint job wasn't even that good.  Basically, this was VERY overpriced for what was an incredibly unexceptional pedicure.  We still enjoyed ourselves, but agreed we would never go back there.~~#~1
Approaching the front of the building, I was instantly impressed with the theatrical lighting on the outside of the building, the foyer is large, ruby red and created a grand mood when I walked in. They even had large crystal chandeliers.  The theater itself is a nice size, not large, but sits on the medium scale. My seat for the Christmas production of the Nutcracker was on the third row, center and the view was nice. There didn't seem to be any room for live band or orchestra, but the sound system was full.~~#~0
I went for both breakfast & dinner two days in a row. I got the commuter sandwich which was fabulous - didn't think such simple ingredients could blow my mind. I came back for dinner and got the kale & quiona salad - again - very simple, but amazing.I need to come back and get the pizza!~~#~1
Kimchi - 5 stars.Other side dishes - OK. there is no date on it so I really don't know how fresh they are. I went there couple times to get side dishes other than Kimchi. it was not as good as Paldo. I only go to Seoul Market for Kimchi now.~~#~0
Simply the best automotive repair place I've yet found in Phoenix. Honest, fair, and competent. I've taken three vehicles there for service over several years now and never been dissatisfied.~~#~1
On atmosphere alone I'd give Sapporo five stars. The restaurant offers a trendy, modern decor and its spacious enough to accommodate the vibe you're seeking, whether it's an intimate date, the bar scene, the sushi bar, a group hibachi table or a large party on the patio. And the servers are all gorgeous. Yes, this is the place "to be seen" in Scottsdale. Food was pretty good, although we just stuck with the happy hour menu. With half price wine and cheap rolls it was a reasonably priced meal. We had the tuna nigri, caterpillar roll, spicy salmon roll, veggie roll and the Kobe beef sliders. Tuna was decent, nothing amazing. The rolls were really small too. There was so much eel sauce on the caterpillar roll that when I went to pick up a piece it fell a part in a soggy mess into my soy sauce (which splashed onto my freshly dry-cleaned cream-colored silk blouse. Lovely.) Spicy salmon was standard--nothing special. I enjoyed the veggie roll the most; the biggest of what we ordered, it was crunchy and flavorful. Kobe beef sliders were delicious but, seriously, who messes up Kobe beef?There is one thing that bothers me while dining at a sushi place: requesting more ginger & emphasizing A LOT more ginger and not receiving it (or receiving a puny pinch). I put in requests to two servers and, after waiting 10 minutes, was brought literally three pieces. Call me picky, but seriously, ginger is a freakin Japanese condiment. Show me the money! (or ginger, in this case). I do wish to return to try some hibachi. The aromas wafting around the place from the hot tables was intoxicating. Maybe they'll redeem themselves with more ginger.~~#~0
2nd time I went to Grazie and both times it was excellent. The service is fast and attentive and the food great. The portions are huge so there is no problem to share the starter or the thin crust, wood-fired pizza ... So far I had the Dame Edna and the Roma pizza and both were very tasty. The wine collection is great and has some very interesting stuff which includes also less expensive wines. Haven't made it to the desert menu yet as both times there was no space left ...~~#~1
Review #800  I had to wait for a great place to feature for #800.  Enter: Parent morning movies... in a theater that offers changing tables and dim lights in addition to their ultra nice seating, VIP rooms, 21+ beverages, good food service, incredibly friendly staff, and caramel popcorn.  I'm in!!  Oh, and did I mention it's a beautiful, clean theater, too?WHO: All mommies, daddies, and other care-giversWHAT:  Go see a movie with your lil one!WHEN: Wednesday mornings and occasional featured nights. WHERE:  Listings for participating Ultra Star theaters are here... http://www.ultrastarmovies.com/parent_movie_morning.aspHOW: Because Ultra Star theater is AWESOME.WHY:  Because you deserve to get out and enjoy a movie... bonus that it's a movie with Early-Bird prices of $5.75!I wanna give a shout-out to the management, staff and... whoever thought of parent movie mornings to begin with.  It was nice to get out of the house with my lil one, to do something that I used to take for granted when I wasn't a parent. haha  And then to get there and have the theater so nicely set-up, complete with changing tables and dim lights... well that was amazing.  All of the care-givers there were relaxed, happy and able to enjoy a movie without worrying about missing a part if their lil one fussed.  We all had nothing but praises for your kid-friendly attitude and made plans to meet often.  Thank-you Ultra Star Cinema for a new, great experience.  It's been a while since a place surprised me so much (in a good way)!  See ya there!~~#~1
After all the raving I have heard about Matt's Big Breakfast and the long wait I was so excited to enjoy my food. The quality of the ingredients were high; however, the service was not so great. I felt that the waitresses were attempting to rush us out of the restaurant. I realize that it is a busy place, but their overt pushiness was not warranted. Overall I would not go back again. The food was made with great ingrediants, but it just didn't "do it " for me.~~#~0
Went there first thing thing this morning. Ordered 2 simple sandwiches. Took over 35 minutes to make. 6 workers lounging around. Completely ignored. Totally disgusted with their service. Overpriced. Food okay and felt worthless when I left~~#~1
Food is ok. Pad Thai is sub-par. The happy hour is very cool baby suburban around this joint. It's attached to Chandler Fashion Center, so it's busy pretty much all of the time. happy hour specials are just ok, specialty drinks are pretty expensive with little taste and even less alcohol.plus, i loathe happy hours that you can only enjoy in the "bar" area. the patio is the spot for HH, and it's LOUD. not just with vapid chatter, but with the constant scraping of meatl chairs on the concrete. it sounds like i'm being picky, but it's one of those sounds that makes your skin crawl and just kills your mood instantly - over and over and over.anyway, if you're a big time up-and-comer and want everyone to know, this is the place for you.~~#~0
I have been going here for years. I love the "Hong Kong" style pan fried crispy noodles!~~#~1
I've been a patient of Dr Lienau's since I was six years old!  I usually don't care who my primary care physician is, but when it comes to my dentist, there's no way in heck I would switch.  I even referred a co-worker to him recently!  He's very honest, upfront, and has such a great support staff.  Colleen is the NICEST receptionist!  One of the hygienists has been there for years (I forgot her name!!) and is also a very friendly woman.I definitely recommend Dr Lienau!~~#~1
dr. matsumoto and her team are the best!  she came recommended to me by a friend who also goes there.  they truly care about the WHOLE child and not just their medical care.  we have seen 3 of the pediatricians in the office and they have all been great.  we developed a special bond with Dr. Miller during a very lengthy health issue with my son.  it's a 45 minute drive for us now that we've moved, but we still make the drive  to see dr.  miller because we  trust her to make the right decisions and offer the best advice for my child's health.~~#~1
It is important to point out that Blue Adobe Grill is not a Mexican restaurant, it is a New Mexican restaurant. While that may seem to be an unnecessary clarification, it is actually fairly important to keep in mind as you visit. For a New Mexican joint, it is pretty dang good and true to the region, but food a sit-down Mexican joint it would be disappointing. In order to maintain full disclosure, it has been a couple of years since I went here last, but it has been around for years so I can't imagine much has changed. Overall I would recommend it to people who don't have expectations of a certain type of food. It's good but nothing memorable.~~#~0
my first time here at blue 32 was great. i came for happy hour I had the chicken wings and a chambord margarita both are fantastic! service was friendly and fast.~~#~1
Best selection of raw and dehydrated food around.  Very helpful personnel, friendly.  Will shop here each time I vacation here with my dog.~~#~1
We'll take this over Godiva any day!   The staff is always so friendly and they're always nice enough to give my kids (all 4) a sample, too.    Nothing compares to their chocolates, especially the the vanilla milk chocolate, Brown Sugar Milk Chocolate and Coconut Milk Chocolate!  Don't forget the lollipops that last FOREVER for the kids!!  Just make sure you have a few wipes on hand!~~#~1
It's a restaurant in a gas station, but it merits five stars b/c it has glass bottles of soda, just like you find in Mexico.  Good food too.  It's actually not nearly as bad inside as you'd think, it's pretty well set apart from the gas station sales, so I wouldn't mind eating there.  They have a few tables set up inside.  I usually get takeout though (they also deliver).  MANZANA LIFT ROCKS!!!  I'm also going to be drinking the Sprite in the bottle, (cane sugar ftw) and the horchata.  I don't care about Chipotle opening near work anymore, I've found a new Mexican fix for lunch.  What a happy day.~~#~1
I used to work here back when it was a Harkins.  It's way better now.  Comfortable, friendly, laid-back.  Kind of decorated in a golden age of hollywood style.  I dig it.~~#~1
I stumbled across this restaurant several years ago after becoming frustrated with the generally 2 hour wait, (no matter what day) at a DIFFERENT pizza restaurant in Heritage square, downtown Phoenix.  Although the pizza was terrific at that "other" restaurant in Heritage square, I had a pretty UNBELIEVABLE experience....I was with a date, we waited the 2+ hours, had a really good dinner, salad, an appetizer and pizza.  We decided we wanted another pizza and when we asked our server for another, we were told that we could not because there was a line of people waiting to get in.  I was amazed.  We left knowing we would NEVER go back.  I heard about La Piazza al Forno not long after that experience.....I truly believe things happen for a reason.  The pizza was even better and has been consistant ever since.  The service was very warm and friendly, literally like a family welcoming me into their home.  I learned that night, that it was one big family run business.  Oh and by the way, the best...did I say BEST pizza that I not only have had in AZ, but NY has nothing over them!  Icing on the cake, the prices are VERY reasonable! I GOTTA have a fix every 10 days! For the longest time I didn't want to tell anyone about my secret, however, they DESERVE to be known!  AWESOME!!!~~#~1
Wow!  This place is amazing.  So amazing I went there twice in a week.  I will start with my dinner.The ambiance was great.  The place has a nice warm feeling to it and since it was cold outside it was really nice.  They had a large fireplace inside and after dinner we stayed for the great crowd that showed up and went outside.  It was pretty chilly but I didn't even notice as the fire pit was big enough to warm everyone around it.  They also had ample heat lamps.  The food was fantastic.  I had the tomato soup with the grilled cheese crouton in it and it warmed me up and prepped me for my main meal.  I had the burger and tender belly bacon.  This was an amazing treat for my taste buds.  The bacon was not like any bacon I have had on a burger.  It was a perfect complement for each other.  I wanted another one when I was done but couldn't possibly eat anymore. The drinks were great.  They have an amazing wine selection.  The wines we were drinking were affordable and it looks like they really spent some time picking the right wines to carry.  They have some really nice wines that rival the selection of some of the really nice wine bars in Scottsdale as well.  My friends said that the mixed drinks were really well made and they were very happy with how they turned out.  They have just about everything you could want for mixed drinks.Service was amazing as well.  They were really attentive and the owner stopped by to talk to our table.  LunchThe lunch was just as good as the dinner.  I had a shrimp BLT that rivals anything in AZ.  I was glad to see that had a variety of Dr. Pepper/Mr. Pibb on tap.  It was really relaxing to sit there at lunch and enjoy the crowd.  The service was excellent.Overall I highly recommend Vintage 95 for lunch or dinner.  It is a great place for a date at night and you can enjoy the great crowd afterwards with great conversation and ambiance to fit.~~#~1
Mexican places like this need to be judged based on consistency - here's what I mean:42% of the time I've been hungover30% of the time I've been drunk22% of the time I've been sober6%   of the time (other)Food tastes great no matter what, and it's right down the street.~~#~1
Along with pretty much everyone else who has left a review for this place, I LOVE THIS PLACE. I grew up in the area and one night my dad and brother wanted to check it out (my brother is a Yelp addict and saw it had amazing reviews). I was skeptical since, driving past, it is your typical "hole in the wall" kind of place, but I was not disappointed at ALL. The carne asada burrito is amazing, even the salad it comes with is great. I think my favorite thing aside from that would have to be the aguas frescas, particularly the orange one...SO good. You probably will not regret ordering a single thing from this menu. I've gone back countless times, one time bringing one of my friends who was convinced that anywhere a blonde gringa tried to take her for Mexican food would be craptastic, but she loved it too.~~#~1
I wouldn't write a review on a franchise unless it pissed me off. I prefer Papa John's pizza to Dominos or Pizza Hut (by far), but there are some major service issues that have made my five ordering experiences pretty irritating.They can't find my house. It's not hard to find, I swear. It's a piece of cake, and a stone's throw from a major crossroad. They had once taken two hours to deliver a pizza, saying they tried to call me (they didn't), only to return to the store and bring it back once I called. Naturally, I was delivered a lukewarm pizza, but in the nicest way possible was told that it was *my* mistake.  Unacceptable, in the age of online ordering and GPS systems in our phones, there is no excuse for getting lost in what is essentially a three mile drive in a straight line. Without complaining, I had received a coupon for a free large pizza. Apology accepted. Upon visiting the store, I got to keep the card *after* ordering because they gave me the wrong toppings. Suckers.Also, they always take longer than the ETA, even in the middle of a weekday. Even now, I am waiting 70 minutes for a 30-40 minute order, and when I had called 15 minutes ago, was told it was on its way, but that construction was holding it up. Yes, there is construction, but you have taken this long in the past without it. Also, construction would not explain why it takes nearly an hour to produce one large pizza. I even tip nicely.I enjoy Papa John's pizza, but unless my complaints are addressed, I will never order from this location again. I will encourage my friends to follow suit. RAWR.~~#~1
By now you've heard the adventures at the Rustler's Roost ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/rustlers-rooste-phoenix#hrid:_gYib8eA4hDfylSs17Zc_g ). But my adventures in Phoenix didn't end there. My BGF had been hounding me for days to find some great "Q." He was convinced that AZ would have great "Q" on every corner. Now referring back to the link above, I admit that I had a wee hangover at the time. Anyway, I'll press on. We chose this place because BGF thought that this would be the spot. I ordered the roast garlic chicken and realized with my first bite that I had died (most likely alcohol poisoning from the night before) and was now in heaven. This was the best freakin chicken that I ever tasted. Of course I'm in heaven and BGF is grousing about the "Q" not being any good. Now I've listened to this all week from him. - This Q is too Spicy - This Q is too wet - This Q won't fall off the bone - This Q doesn't have the right flavor. I'll admit it, I snapped. (And I didn't forgive him for about 2 weeks). I went up one side and down the other. If you don't like the gosh darn (loosely translated) Q in AZ, the quit ordering the Blankity Blank (translation again) stuff. Needless to say, I got quite the look from BGF and boss. Boss was actually laughing at us. Anyway, I took pity on my BGF and shared some of my chicken, and he fell in love (I don't know why, it wasn't a rooster - oops, I digress). Anyway, it was decided then and there, this is the best chicken around, hands down.~~#~1
I love this restaurant.  I really enjoy the reverse happy hour from 10pm-12am after I see a movie.  The appetizers are 1/2 price and they have some really good drink specials- better if you are a lady.   l like sitting out of the patio and relaxing.The sushi rolls are good.  So are the avocado eggrolls.Before I was a vegetarian the only thing I would order was the macademia crusted chicken with mashed potatoes and a creamy soy sauce.~~#~1
The venue, which is close to campus, usually gets all the big shows from Hot Hot Heat to Incubus to Mickey Avalon to Brand New. The great thing about the venue is that you can stand almost anywhere and still be able to see the band. There's a big bar inside with friendly bartenders, although the well drinks can be a little pricey. There's usually a hot dog vendor outside and most of the bands performing can be found walking around before and/or after their sets, making it easy to mingle. The downside about the Marquee is that parking sucks. There's not a ton of parking in the club's lot and the nearby lots usually fill up fast so be prepared to trek down Mill to get to and from your car if you don't arrive early.~~#~0
First time here, it's late night and I wanted something lite and healthy..  The place is open very late, they had lots of options and the food was perfect.What a beautiful place inside, simple yet elegant.  Oh, the service was great too......Go for a late night drink with a date and they'll be impressed.~~#~0
It is what you would expect from any themed place called "Heart Attack Grill".  Mirrors on the bottom part of the bar so you can see up the skimpy outfits the "nurses" wear at the bar.  Van in the drive through section is painted to look like an Ambulance.  Hamburgers are named after cardiac events.The food was bad, greasy unlimited fries and a giant hamburger that tasted as if they mixed in filler of some kind we had never experienced before.If you plan on going, enjoy the experience cause the food will not be something you would head back for again.~~#~1
My wife and i stayed there for our anniversary and had a great time.  little dissappointed in the cottage we stayed in.  i know the place is old but you have to update and remodel every once in awhile (century).  I want to give 4 stars but i also think that the price was a little steep for a summer rate.  Now, i know that i should expect to pay alot for the biltmore but i am not the ritzy type of person.  I am sure my wife would give it 5 stars.~~#~0
Great variety.  Great price!  Beats other buffets in the East Valley.~~#~1
We just tried this out this afternoon following lunch at Pita Jungle next door.   It's a self-service yogurt shop where you pay by the ounce once you've finished your creation.  The offerings included the standard vanilla and chocolate, but also less traditional offerings like Irish Mint and Red Velvet were also available.  They offer a taste of any of the products, and you can mix multiple types of yogurts in your container.  They also offer a variety of standard yogurt shop toppings for your creation.I had a combination of the Irish Mint and Latte yogurts, with a couple of toppings.  The yogurt itself was smooth, creamy and well flavored.We'll likely be dropping by here in the future.~~#~1
Great place!  I love that they feature wines from "the little guys."  You won't find most of what they feature at any Total Wine or Bevmo.  Small business supporting small business... totally awesome in my eyes!  The staff is knowledgeable and ooooh Chef Sarah - your food pairings with the wine in the wine 101 course were AMAZING!  Katie, the sommelier, is fun and she knows her stuff, plus it is clear that she loves to share her knowledge of wine with everyone.  I'll be back for sure!~~#~1
I'd give it about a 4.5, but I like rounding up for local businesses!  The owner has been in there every time I've shown up, and the food comes out hot.  The prices are spot on what you'd expect to pay, and so is the quality.  I'm not from Chicago, and have only been there a couple times, so I wouldn't be able to speak to its authenticity - but I can speak to its taste and the great customer service the crew provides every time.  If you're in the neighborhood and thinking about a hot dog, burger, fried zuccini, italian beef sandwich, or chicken burger, skip Sonic and DQ - they can't touch this place with a 15-yard drive-thru window.~~#~1
Best muffler shop in town. There are VERY few shops that I trust, and Mighty Muffler is one of them.  Greg has worked on multiple cars and has always done a great job.  If there is ever any issues he takes care of the problem, no questions asked.~~#~1
Aiello's is my favorite Italian spot in the Valley.  In fact, I day dream about the Mushroom Ravioli Special - you can taste the love in this dish.   Great ambiance and a wonderful experience.  The staff are always attentive and professional.  The Owner makes a stop or two to make sure you're having a good time and they even let chance decide who pays for dinner, you or the house!Helpful hint:  Try no to get stuffed on the tasty bread and hot peppers served before the entree, you're going to want to finish it!~~#~1
Ok..seriously just ok. Green salsa was horribly sweet and gel like. It had no taste of tomatillo in it. The tacos were stuffed to the gills but average. The chimis tasted reheated in the microwave and oddly like sopapillas. Over all ok food but a bit pricy for ok food.~~#~0
I've been here a couple of times.  The first time was on first fridays.  I expected it to be packed, but I was able to walk right in and be seated.  They had a table reserved and they must not have shown, so we lucked out.  I got the Sante Fe, a roast beef panini, and it was great.  They had some good beers on tap too.  Its a cool little funky place to grab a good sandwhich.  The second time I came here it was after a concert.  There was some horrible band playing that I wish would have shut up so I could hear the people in front of me without having to feel sharp pains in my ear, but the meal was still good and I liked it.  Any place that is open late close to downtown is perfect, especially since the kitchen doesn't close until 12:30~~#~1
I still want to live here.  It's quite possibly the only vegan restaurant I could see myself flying here to eat at then going home.    I've tried a number of things, and have come to the conclusion that this is the combination that will satisfy me each time:  Green Burger with thyme fries and the Cookies n Cream Tsoynami.  Their Green Burger trumps The Plant Cafe and Roam in SF--the only two places I've been to that somewhat mimic it (at least in color).~~#~1
This place is a dream.  Designer blouses for $17.00.  Seven jeans and Hudson jeans for $20.  Steve Madden shoes for $25.  I could go on... the store is beautiful, well-organized and full of things that are in perfect or near-perfect condition.  Some items are still quite pricey, but most of the store is extremely reasonably priced.  If you need something new very quickly for a date or an interview or a special occasion, you will probably find it here.  The employees are nice, friendly, helpful and the dressing rooms are good as well.  Love it!~~#~1
Hob Nob's Coffee House and Gourmet Deli is what has emerged from the dust and smoke that once was the Willo House (one "w", not two). Willo House was a Phoenix landmark beloved by many for its tremendous coffee, well-worn couches, and memories of Mary McCann's Poetry Slams--and loathed by others for its unmistakable smoke stench and vocally hung-over clientele.  So, like many CenPhos, I felt saddened  when I saw the "closed" sign hung on Willo's door earlier this year, and I've been watching for this coffee interloper to open its doors. I've been hopeful that we'd find a new funky midtown establishment to add to Phoenix's growing reputation for goodness. Feeling emboldened and optimistic after voting on November 4th, Baby Oli and I stopped into Hob Nob's for a morning caffeine treat.  Let me begin by saying, holy moley, they got the smell of smoke out! I thought for sure that the odor of cloves and American Spirit would have permanently saturated the building's core.  In fact, there was not much at all inside to remind me of the Willo-that-was. They've knocked down walls to widen the space inside and painted in warm hues . The place now has what you might call "a décor." They said good-bye to funky and eclectic, and hello...hmm... Pottery Barn? I ordered an iced chai tea and a chocolate pastry. The chai was a chai, and the pastry was yummy, but not OMG-eat-here-this-instant yummy. The sandwich and salad menu looks awesome with sandwiches boasting of roast sirloin and "the finest long line caught Albacore tuna center cut all white meat."  They also have some pretty impressive looking hand-made chocolates.I'm not going to lie, I do miss the old, lovingly run-down, Willo style. Hob Nob's felt a little too Scottsdale to me. I may be 100% wrong on this, but I don't think the owners of Hob Nob's are Phoenicians. The man who made my Chai had clearly never been to--or maybe even heard of--the original Willo, and wasn't interested in any jovial chit chat about the old locale, they spelled "Willo House" incorrectly on their take-away menu, and the place simply doesn't have that Phoenix feel. Regardless of the Scottsdale vibe, I will go back to try those sandwiches, or maybe to test out their springy couches and fire place while grading essays. I'd love to toss them one more star! Fingers crossed that they'll relax a bit and make the most of their great location!~~#~0
I got a BBQ chicken sandwich and all the bones came complementary! SICK!  I almost broke my teeth when I bit into it.  The service was even worse, the manager (I think) stood in the way of me ordering while he was talking on the phone about football for about 10 min.GROSS!~~#~1
AWFUL!!! HORRIBLE!!!!!IT was just HORRIBLE experience! I made an appointment for mani and pedi and came in Friday morning at 10 am. There was only one lady working there (no bage with her name) She said she could take me earlier than 10. I said it's fine, she asked me  to pay cash right away! only cash she said!! And ask me to go to ATM to get cash! I was surprised, but didn;t think anything bad. Later I realized that I didnt get any reciept so she just put my cash in her pocket because there were noone else there at that time.She started with manicure and it took her less than 10 min!! everything was done in 10 min! She didnt even the nails, didnt remove the cuticule -she just polished the nailes with an old file. Her work was so nigligent in everything! Nail polish was all around the nails and my finger tips. I suggested her to correct it and remove an extra polish around and she did it only on few nails, repeating all the time :"Pretty? Yes?" It was so far from looking pretty!I'm a polite person by nature and never argue, but here it was just awful! And I payed her first together with the tips so she took 45 bucks from meHer pedi was not better at all!! She was always in a hurry! She didnt let my nails  dry and started putting my shoes on me! I warned her that it must have been not done yet, but she didnt listen, she wanted to get rid of me as soon as possible, so all the nails went messy!!! She reapplied the polish but the whole procedure was just so frustrating!! I left the place more than just upset-I was really mad!  The next day the nail polish started to chip off on every other finger! OMG! I wanted to cry! It's the worse mani and pedi I've ever gotten in my entire life, and I do it every month!!I wish I had a reciept and could get back to talk to the manager -but this lady just took my 45 bucks and left me with ugly! really ugly work!!!~~#~1
Warning: Douche Bag level CODE RED!Here's how my experience went ... Me: "May I have a Carmel Latte?" Employee: "No".... dead air ...Me: "Ummm why not?"Employee: "We don't have carmel"Me: "Ummm I guess I'll just have a Cappuccino then"Employee: "Just so you know it's a REAL Cappuccino"Me: "Okay" (in my head I'm trying to figure out if I can legally punch this dickhead in the face or not).So I sat down mulling over this experience in the dank dark atmosphere while listening to this ass wipe talk to his friend about living on other peoples couches for the past few months and about how he'll be moving to downtown Phoenix soon. To which I just chuckled to myself as this person was FAR from cool enough to blend into CenPho. What a complete and utter douche bag. Stay in Tempe poser (and keep your employer there to!).This experience was months ago, and now they have opened up a shop downtown. Guess what? I'm not going to check them out. Fuck you Cartel. You'll never be Lux, so just stay in Tempe where you can be a complete poser with an attitude that you haven't earned.Complete FAIL. For my two cents, skip this place and go to Lux in CenPho/Mid Town right off the Light Rail. Authentically cool with ZERO attitude, great coffee and no douche bag employees. And as for great coffee ... try Conspire WAY better coffee and authenticly cool.---- please read "owners comment" below ... here's my response ... ----Wow so the coffee snobbery continues with the owner ... I guess my new job  should be to "promote good coffee in Arizona" ... and I don't appreciate good coffee because I enjoy the combination of caramel AND coffee ... By that definition I guess I don't know good ice cream because I like hot fudge on it or good pizza because I enjoy pepperoni AND cheese or good music if it's not acoustic or a good voice unless it's A cappella ... thanks for proving my point. I wouldn't go here unless you are a total coffee snob ... (I guess) they don't need your business you poser!~~#~1
This is the second time I've eaten here and it was as good if not better than the first. The first time I had the meat lasagna and the second time I had the cheesesteak. Lemme tell you this is one of the best Italian places I've been to in Phx.It's very Back East feel to it and I love all of the authentic Italian foods they have there, especially the meat, cheese and pasta counters.Check 'em out you won't be disappointed!~~#~1
Open Range offers some damn-good home cooking. My family eats here often and has never had a bad meal. Not to mention that the portions are huge. I usually order the cobb salad. From a typical deli, I'd normally expect iceberg lettuce, a handful of shaved carrots, some egg, and a little bit of bacon. But if that were the case, I wouldn't be ordering the salad again and again. The field greens and romaine lettuce are served with avocado (I'm pretty sure they use at least 1/2 an avocado for each salad), artichoke hearts, tomatoes, bacon (no bacon bits here!), radishes, blue cheese, egg, cucumbers  and I'm sure i'm forgetting something else, but it is GOOD. Sometimes, if I'm really hungry, I order it with a side of their twice baked casserole (twice baked potato in a cup, basically. It's unbelievable.) I'd also recommend the Arizona caviar (black bean salad) or southwest coleslaw.My dad loves their BBQ sandwiches (with choice of homemade barbecue sauce - each one better than the last), my mom usually orders one of their other great salads with a side of potato pancakes (better than grandma's), and grandpa loves whatever is on special. Even my picky-eater brother loves food at Open Range - and that's saying something!Bethany and Tom are the owners; Bethany does most of the kitchen cooking and Tom says that he's in charge of most of the barbecuein'. (He once gave my family a taste of some of their freshly smoked pecans and WHOA, they were GOOD.) The restaurant (as the name suggests) has a full service deli too, in case you need a pound of freshly sliced ham as well as a meal.In the past, the service has been slow, but it has improved dramatically over the past year. The restaurant has a killer view of the Superstition Mountains, and is within 10 - 20 minutes of countless hiking trails. To make this long review short: if you're looking for a tastes-like-home (or tastes-better-than-home) cooked meal and you're in the far east valley, make sure to stop in for lunch or dinner. You'll probably see my family and me chowing down too.~~#~1
One of the perks to being an only child, is "me" time. There is something special about having time to yourself, when the only obligation you have is to check in on Yelp, leave a quick tip, and grab a lemonade from the mall because it is 109 degrees outside.Yesterday was that day. I had stumbled across The Art of Shaving. I've been in their stores in other cities before. Of course I have...because if you look at any of my pictures, you will realize a couple things: 1. I'm vain. 2. I'm hairless.As soon as you step foot into this store, you are in a true gentleman's club. Not the kind that will take all your dollar bills. You won't make it rain here.This is the ultimate shaving store. Soaps, creams, blades, razors, balms, brushes, and mugs. You name it, they have it.The staff knows what they are talking about. I explained to them that I have a very old safety razor and a brush. Both were passed down by my Grandfather who passed away when I was a teenager.They didn't pressure me into buying ANYTHING, although I did end up leaving with some shaving cream. They even gave me a proper demo on how to use it properly with my brush. I've been used to shaving soaps and the usual aerosol creams....so the little tutorial was nice.Also, there is a master barber in the back of the house that does straight razor shaves, haircuts, and men's facials.Remember earlier when I said that "me" time is a perk? This is the best place to spend it if you are a dude.If you are a woman, buy your man, or your man-friend a gift from here. This place is simply amazing.One last warning. The store is pricey. but worth every single penny.~~#~1
This location has closed.  Went by today and found an empty restaurant.~~#~1
Just left. I wanted to eat another pizza it was that good.  The Biagga was fantastic. Probably the best prosciutto style pizza I've ever had.  Owner and staff were very friendly.   I will be back again.~~#~1
If I were ever to be executed, I'd want a Meat & Cheese pasty for my last meal. With two red wine gravy.It's *that* good.~~#~1
Overall I liked this place and glad it is in the neighborhood.  The carne asada burrito was good and the ceviche was pretty tasty.  However, it seems that this is about all there is to the menu.  I was not a fan of the set-up of the restaurant.  It was way too crowded - yes it was lunch, but the flow could have been a lot better.  Overall, I will return when in the mood for carne asada.  Hopefully the kinks will get worked out over time and until then I look forward to supporting a local restaurant.~~#~0
the food here is deeee-licious. i like the decor, the ambiance, the menu, the waitstaff. however, i hate the feeling that i'm being some trendy little scottsdale frou-frou by eating here.the salads are totally inventive and yummy, but a little on the sweet side. i loooooooooooove that you can add an egg (genius!!!) and fresh garlic to your pizza. i adore the fresh and homemade ingredients, and i really like the cute little neighborhood-eatery feel. eating here makes me feel as if i'm in a bigger city than phx. LGO is on the pricey side, and definitely caters to those who want to eat gourmet/designer pizza. however, taste wins out with all the fantastic and fresh toppings. and if you ever get sick of franchise restaurants a la CPK, LGO is a great alternative.~~#~0
we keep driving by this place thinking it was just a coffee house. but after reading some of yelps reviews, learned it was much more. it's so cute and trendy inside. they have so many yummy and healthy options, we didn't know what to pick. so we decided to go with the veggie breakfast burrito.it was light and filling, much to our surprise. and superbly tasty. and best of all, not gigantic. more places should do that....offer reasonably priced food, that tastes great, in manageable portions. that way, you don't stuff your face with a giant food plate and then feel like an obese slob the rest of the morning. we'll hit this place up again for sure. awesome staff too!!!!~~#~1
Perhaps you've heard of the Library of Congress.  Nice Library.Burton Barr Central Library has a bigger reading room.Wil Bruder was the Architect.  You either love his work, or you hate his work.  I love his work!  And, this library is as good as it gets.Arrive in the sixth floor reading room a little before Noon *on* the Summer Solstice.  Ask a librarian:  They'll tell you why. [ah, the mystery....]~~#~1
I've got two names for you:  TYLER & MARCO - - superstar instructors at the Y!!!I've been an avid gym member at various gyms for years and I have to say, the YMCA downtown can't be beat for the 8-5 p.m. work schedule person who likes to attend the gym during lunch or right after work.  I'm all about the group exercise classes and this Y offers an array of classes such as spin, kickboxing, Zumba, Yogalates, Boot camp, water aerobics, Hatha Yoga, etc., etc.Back to my fav instructors:  Tyler and Marco.  Boy, do these boys kick my ass every time I take their classes! Tyler teaches spin and offers not only strong knowledge and great tips on making your spin experience the best that it can be, he has a kick-ass playlist of music to motivate his class.  Marco is a very intense and interactive kickboxing instructor who keeps pushing you with great music mixes to keep his class sweating the weight and stress away.Thank you Tyler and Marco for making my workouts intense and fun!  After years of going to different aerobic classes, I'm FINALLY seeing the results!!P.S.  You can't beat the staff that works there.  Erica who manages all the group exercise instructor welcomes any suggestions or comments with a smile.  Freddie at the front desk is also very helpful and sweet.~~#~1
Love this place!  Was in phoenix 3 weeks for work.  Ate here 3 times.  The squid salad is amazing!  They also have sushi, bibimbap, and tons of other items.  Must try!~~#~1
I don't think there is anything else to be said about Delux, it's been around and they offer nothing but great food; the Classic Burger and the Delux burger are both very delicious.  I like Delux better and I do recommend medium rare; the quality of the meat is unbelievable.  Love the sweet fries; I do prefer the mixture of both sweet and regular fries.~~#~1
Who would have ever thought, chicken and waffles combination?  It is crazy, but it sure does.  The location of hidden inside a big plaza of Albertsons, Aces Hardware, Gas Station, and much more.  It is really hard to find unless you have been inside the shopping center.  People here in AZ like to say something is located on the northwest corner of the street.  This would make it impossible to describe.Once you get there, the restaurant is pretty small.  Typically there is a pretty long wait, but I was lucky the day I went. One good thing is they offer white breast chicken meat, which is always a bonus.  The chicken was tasty, even though I am normally not a fan of fried chicken.   I love waffles, but it seemed like the waffles came out cold, as though they were reheated or Eggo Waffles.  I loved Eggo Waffles growing up, but I don't expect frozen waffles at an establishment.  I would stick to the chicken and call this place Lo Lo Chicken House.~~#~0
Outdoor shopping at its best... probably not the best if its hot outside- but great outdoor dining and misters... :-)~~#~1
I waited months before finally getting around to coming here, and it wasn't all I had hoped for. Went for my birthday, and got the garlic bread appetizer, wasn't very good and got crumbs all over the table. It had an odd burnt taste. Got the mushroom and steak calzone, which was huge and filling, but very greasy and took a long time to actually get to the table. They claimed it was the Hoagie that one of my friends had that took so long, but it shouldn't take so long to cook a sandwich. Either way, delicious, but nothing too special for the price. I won't likely return here, since some of my friends don't like this place.~~#~0
You know the story about the cobbler who created all those adorable shoes for the elves in the village? Ok, so maybe that story doesn't go exactly like that. Regardless, I found Old Town Scottsdale's version of the magical cobbler who can do wonders with shoes and I found it at Tony's Shoe Repair! Here, Tony keeps shoes in spic and span condition and if you bring them in looking anything but shiny and new, you can be sure they will be returned as good as new. Tony's Shoe Repair also handles purses and belts. They do everything for a shoe including simple repairs such as widening and adding those little tricky bottom parts of heels that never seem to last, to giving your worn our shoes an entire face lift. The prices here are reasonable and he does the work for you in a speedy time frame. I dropped off my sad looking boots off and he freshened them up and added new heel bottoms to them in a day's time. The fairytales can keep their magical cobblers, here in the real world we've got something even better -- Tony's Shoe Repair!~~#~1
Great concept my nephews requested I take them there when I was visiting from out of town. We really had a wonderful time, I just wish the staff was a tad bit more friendly for the amount of money we paid for being there. I get it, its annoying explaining how the process works for each person that walks through the door but, I never done this before so I was asking questions.. seemed the employee was a little frustrated which was annoying. But, I stuck it through because that's what my nephews wanted. Other then that this place was fun for adults and the kids. Very therapeutic, quiet and allowed your inner creative side to shine through. Great amount of colors to work with and supply. I would do it again with them but, hopefully the person at the front desk could smile more often!~~#~0
How many great things can one say about the Cartel? Does Infinity work! Yes, that was a statement, not a question. I am in love with the CC, hands down. I have traded my gold Starbucks card in for this amazingly Delicious start to my day. The iced coffee ( actually, its Toddy, which is better) is amazing. They roast their own beans, and allow the iced coffee to sit over night, creating an extremely potent concoction. The hot drinks, A+++ as well. And, the food? A+++++ (5, yup its that legit). Grab the cheddar bacon muffin... its literally heaven. No joke. Heaven. Little clouds may form above your head; white clouds of course! Not those nasty rain clouds. OK, maybe not clouds. But defiantly your day will be sunny because you stopped into Coffee Cartel. And not because you live in AZ. Duh. Only complaint I have is the hours. I live right next door, and their only open M-F (like so many places in DT-Pho). PLLLEEEEAAAASSSEEEEEE open up for the weekends!!! I'll work for free! Well...wait... I'll come visit.~~#~1
Cute, cozy, pleasant and very friendly service. That is really all I have to say about them. The food was oh so delicious! Little bite sized tacos. Service was fast and just perfect! They even use the square card reader on their iPad to charge cards. Which truly shows its a small and quaint restaurant.~~#~1
Needed to get some keys made, so I dropped by here.  The key machine is located at the front of the store at the customer service/returns desk.  I popped in and they made my keys within minutes.  The girl working the machine was really efficient and got me out of there fast......which is great because I hate waiting.Will have to drop by here for other home stuff another time.Return Factor - 84%~~#~0
I have used Todd on at least a dozen occasions. I am a property investor and I buy multiple homes. I need Todd for EVERY house I do and he is ALWAYS there for me. He even got me into my own car once. At the drop of a hat, he is there for me. His knowledge is excellent, his demeanor is fantastic and his service and workmanship is excellent. I would NEVER use another locksmith unless he was dead or out of town. In which case I would probably ask him to come home. :) Use this guy. Hes great.~~#~1
My pants get tight when I think about Pho Thanh.There is little else that I can say that would more accurately convey my love for this restaurant.~~#~1
This place is great. The first time I went in I didn't have change for the parking meter and they easily helped me out. Adrian cut my hair and did a great job. Everyone was friendly and made you feel welcome.~~#~1
Indiana University went to a bowl game for the first time in a crazy number of years.And my big little cousin is one of their defensive ends.  So it was my pleasure to end 2007 watching the Hoosiers play the Cowboys of Oklahoma State University.  I can't think of any better way to finish off what's been a crazy year...though it was improved by being joined in the stands by Nadia C. (soon-to-be G.) and her adorable fiance Ben.  I don't understand football, so the game was kinda secondary for me, but being amongst all those screaming fans, and the cheerleaders and the band was great.  I'd forgotten that energy since leaving my sports loving home town.But the game was pretty good. Would have been better if Kellen Lewis would have completed 60% or more of his passes.  Or if the Hoosiers had won (hey coach....DEFENSE!).  But football is pretty awesome from only 5 rows up.  Add some people watching (guy in red pants and wig), constructive advice to the IU dance team (buy new uniforms...something along the lines of the sparkly orange dresses of the OSU girls), and the awesome Marching Hundred (who knew that mainstream marching bands play riding dirty).  And we had a blast./The only downer was not being able to visit with my cousin after the game.  For "security" reasons, they wouldnt let family and friends see the players at the stadium.  Since I wasn't staying at the hotel, and didn't know what hotel that was, I wasn't able to see him.  I was terribly disappointed to come all that way and not be able to give him a hug and give him a hard time about growing up to be a big burly football player.  In my head, he's still 12 and  gangly, and trying to grow into his feet and his ears.  But it's great to see that hes a "grown man", in college, playing football and playing for a team that's getting better every season.So GO BIG RED!  And hopefully there will be another bowl visit to kick off 2009.~~#~1
I enjoyed seeing the Cezanne collection. It's just like pictured in the book. I spent time reading about his works and his influence on composition and form. As in other museum I've visited, one really can't take pictures of their best display. It's really a place to walk around for a couple of hours when one doesn't feel rush.I wanted to be surprise to see Classical sculptures and hand made works of art and I didn't see any here as,  I'm very particular about the historical eras and movement of interest . Leave that to the big city museums. The fact that they have high end borrowed art and a place like this in Phoenix makes it a must for resident to see once in a while what the civic offering provides. This place is half a block off the light rail makes it convenient.~~#~0
We've take our daughter to Dr. Ramirez at TLC since we were released from the hospital.  I've seen all but one of the four doctors, and have been extremely pleased with all of them.  They offer both a sick and well child waiting room.  Our daughter loves the themed rooms.  With small children, you will have the inevitable emergencies that require a doctors visit.  My child is two now, and we have never been unable to get an emergency/sick appointment.  Our phone calls have always been promptly returned on the same day.  Anything they told us they were doing, was done as promised.  I cannot recommend them highly enough!~~#~1
I ate at Scramble last Friday and I have to say that it was a horrible experience.  What attracted me to this place was the separate vegan menu in addition to their regular menu - this makes things easier when dining with vegan and non-vegan friends.  So I happily ordered a tofu wrap and added fried potatoes as a side and awaited my food.  We started eating and my friend found a hair in his food...not good!  He threw it on the floor and tried to drop it.  Well moments later I found a hair in my food...  I couldn't believe there was hair on both of our plates!  I was so disgusted I could no longer eat my food (and I was ravenous).  I told the girl working the register about the whole ordeal, she walked back to the kitchen then back to the register and completely ignored me (she said she'd come back to my table).  Before we left I spoke with someone else and showed them the hair, clearly not one of mine.  All I got was "Oh, I'll check the guys in the back."  Check the guys in the back???  What?  How about, sorry may I refund you your money?  Additionally, the few bites I had of my burrito were pretty bland, it needed seasoning or hot sauce.  Overall, I wouldn't go back...unless I somehow develop a taste for hair, although I'm sure that won't happen.  I did take a picture of my food before I attempted eating it and if you zoom in enough you can see part of the hair sticking out of my food - I'll be posting them.~~#~1
Oh AJ's...  How do I love thee...  Let me count the ways (BEERS)... 1...2...3...200!They have so many different beers to choose from here.  If you ever need an ingredient that is out of the norm they will have it.  If you ever need an ingredient for a special dinner that MUST be fresh and ripe, this is the place.From 10 differnt types of flower, 15 different brands of pasta, to 20 different types of EVOO, if you're making a really great dinner, spend the extra couple of bucks and get your stuff here.One day I'll be able to afford the prime steaks.~~#~1
This little joint is right down the street from my crib and I've had the chance to dine here on several occasions (take out and dine in). Each and every time its been great! Extremely fresh ingredients and even better prices!! Great local place to get some great grub on a small budget. Highly recommended!~~#~1
despite it's billing as the 'largest thrift store in north america,' i'm pretty sure this is the island of misfit goodwill items. the place is huge, but i've never, ever found anything good in this store. i'm not sure how that's possible. but i would never go out of my way to shop here.i have no bathroom report for this location because i've never been in there long enough to actually go.~~#~1
My wife turned me on to this gem. Her family has been eating here since the 70's it never disappoints. The machaca is moist not wet like many others. The Pepsi from the fountain is the best fountain soda anywhere.~~#~1
I love this place! The owner is always there and you can tell he takes great pride in what he does. Great food and great customer service!~~#~1
The best fried calamari in Surprise! Delish pizza! Consistent quality and service, never have been disappointed since we moved here in June!~~#~1
I loved Joe's Farm Grill...you haven't lived until you have tried the Blue Cheese Burger..(not sure what it is named on the menu)...I fancy steak encrusted with blue cheese, this burger is the next best thing.  Their garlic fries are to die for...heck, everything they cook is incredible...worth the drive...~~#~1
Best pizza in the valley that I've had (I've yet to do Pizzaria Banco).  Great service, always made fast, and GREAT pricing...doens't travel well, so if you're gonna have it in your car for a while I wouldn't recommend it...I think that's why there's a lot of "soggy crust" comments etc...~~#~1
You have to know what you're looking for to find this place.  I've passed this location several dozen times and never realized that a restaurant & bar was located underground.  A friend of mine invited me to have a few drinks and some dinner and I was intrigued, so I decided to go for it.We sat at the bar and ordered glasses of Wine and some Oysters.  The bar was packed, but we were able to comfortably enjoy our food and have a conversation.  The food was OK.  The Wine was the house Zinfandel, which was *eh*....but I didn't like the call options, so whatever.....now I know not to order Wine here.Overall, it wasn't too bad of an experience.  Next time, I'll go with a Beer instead of Wine and try sitting in the dining room.Return Factor - 80%~~#~0
Best pizza in AZ, hands down.~~#~1
The food and drinks are blah, but the service is always great! Happy hour and trivia are always fun at Skip & Jan's.~~#~0
I was really disappointed with my local Baja Fresh tonight.  The lobby, salsa bar and even drink station were very dirty and unkept.  To top that off my salad had old dark colored guacamole and limp lettuce.I hope they read this and will do a better job at cleaning up!~~#~1
I don't think I've ever been to this place when it's not been crazy busy. It's just a small little eatery, but it's always busy. They have some great food and the peanut butter pie is delicious. Just a place to hang out and enjoy some breakfast, lunch, dinner or snacks at. Parking isn't the best and that is a problem, but if you live close and can walk, its ideal.~~#~1
They have the nicest staff and the Dr. is always open when examining our dog! We have boarded her there as well and the staff is so kind, and when our dog gets there she cant wait to run up and play with the staff!~~#~1
Tried this place for the first time tonight, and was impressed with absolutely everything. Well-lit building in a decent location in the Arcadia area. I drove here from the Garfield neighborhood and it was well worth it. Juicy chicken and awesome cafeteria throwback crinkle fries, along with one of the best slices of toast I've ever had. All three of these foods were still crispy when I got home, which almost never happens with fast food. I wish I had gotten the girl's name who took care of me. She was cute as a button- very enthusiastic and happy to answer my questions. I'll be back here soon!~~#~1
Great spa... If you don't mind spending a few bucks, this is the place for you. Neat water fall room, roof top pool, and eucalyptus room! I've had multiple massages here & they were exceptional. Outstanding customer service too.~~#~1
I cannot get enough of LGO.My favorite time to come is very early in the morning to enjoy the sun coming up over Camelback Mountain while having some organic coffee and a blackberry bran muffin.The breakfast at LGO has something for everybody, IMO. Try the Croque M'Dame if you want something really bold. The lunch and dinner options are great too. This is the only restaurant I have ever been that I could eat all three meals and feel like I was being served from a different kitchen each time.The only draw back I can think of for LGO is the tendency for it to become very crowded. That's the best problem a restaurant can have, so they're probably not too worried about it. The parking situation can become an issue too, but for my time and money, it's worth it.LGO is top notch in my book and you can find me there pretty regularly.~~#~1
4.5 stars!I've eaten at Liberty Market a few times already, but this morning marked my first breakfast- and what a fantastic meal it was!- of pancakes (3 in a stack; $6.5) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ?select=Xg8U6Fz2E8hu0xQ3Hf7CZg#Xg8U6Fz2E8hu0xQ3Hf7CZg w/ added topping of "market-made granola" ($1), a side of Grilled Flattened Meatballs ($3.5) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ?select=MMwKpMltbKCWNNlraI-tGw#MMwKpMltbKCWNNlraI-tGw, and a double-shot of espresso ($2) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ?select=M1WrCuX3oouHHrynL8KJQg#M1WrCuX3oouHHrynL8KJQg.  Service was in fine form-- I couldn't have the market-made maple syrup blend, nor any of the house-whipped cream, blueberry compote, raspberry and apricot jams, or any of the flavored syrups used at the coffee counter (my server patiently checked for those items we were unsure about), and when I asked for chocolate chips, I was, instead, offered a chocolate syrup made from scratch composed of chocolate, sugar, and coco oil... good stuff!  This syrup would be excellent on ice cream sundaes, too.  (FYI, I didn't really need anything extra to add to the pancakes and meatballs... the two paired well!)I've mentioned this once before, but I think it's such a great thing to yelp about again-- buy an espresso (or any of their specialty coffees), and you can have unlimited cups of regular coffee during your meal!  Not like I needed more caffeine after the double-shot, but I did have some of the house-blend coffee.  After 1.5 pancakes, the meatballs (watch out, they're very greasy!), and caffeine, I'll be good to go for a few hours, despite only having four hours of sleep!  (I'm hoping, anyway!)p.s.  Despite tipping more than 20% at the cashier upon ordering, I thought Bruce, the server who took care of me at my table, deserved a couple more bananas for not displaying annoyance at my staying here so long.  One more reason why I love Liberty Market so much!  Addendum:  After getting directions from Bruce as to the quickest way to 101 N, he asked me if I wanted a cup of coffee to go, gratis!  Have I told you how much I love Liberty Market??Helpful hint:  Free wifi can be accessed by entering the code printed at the bottom of your receipt.~~#~1
Delish!!!!!! x 100!!Love, love, love this place. This is the place that made me a Vietnamese fan for sure. My friend brought me here and I was blown away but the tastiness of their food. Their spring rolls are so yummy! The chicken noodle soup flavor is a winner in my book! Everything on the menu is delicious, though I haven't tried is all, I'm sure it is!~~#~1
Went here tonight with the padres and husband.  This place is the whole Joes BBQ/Joes Farm Grill owners.  We saw that it was the highest rated here on Yelp for restaurants in Gilbert. Paper menus are available near the counter where you order your meal.  We started with the Hummus + olives appetizer.  Mom and I shared the Apricot Chicken with mashed sweet potatoes, Dad had some steak sandwich with horseradish that was very tasty, husband had the Salmon BLT with avacado.  I tasted everything and ALL the food was delicious!! There were also very interesting and unique beer and wine offerings.  There is an espresso bar that sells various coffees, as well as some sweet stuff.  There is still a little market in the back selling local olive oil from Queen Creek Olive Oil Mill, as well as pasta, pure vanilla extract and other items.I highly recommend a trip to Liberty Market for a fresh, home-cooked meal.~~#~1
I have been here once for lunch and sat outside only to get eaten alive by flies, nothing worse than eating outside on a nice patio and being pestered the entire time. I decided to give it another chance for happy hour, well guess what? flies followed me inside too. I don't know if it was the time of year (early spring) or what, but they really need an exterminator!~~#~1
Enjoyed date night here with the hubby. Try the gluten free pizza. A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! Mmmmmmm~~#~1
As a vegetarian with a fairly adventurous palate, I love Ethiopian food. And now that I work in northern Tempe, I'm here all the time. It's filling, flavorful and inexpensive. I can have a pretty big dinner for less than $10. If you, like me, think spiced (though not particularly spicy) vegetables are the greatest things on Earth, definitely pay a visit to Blue Nile.~~#~1
This is an amazing taco truck just minutes from the airport. I ordered the amazing ceviche and a barbacoa burrito, while my girlfriend ordered three tacos. I've said it before and I'll say it again here: this truck is an excellent example of the inverse correlation between price and taste in Mexican food. Eat here before your next flight!~~#~1
Update:  Unfortunately... the last two times we've come back, the food was just ok.  Definitely not $140.00 great.   We even went for their three plate combo for $40.00 / person, and the cupcake it came with, I only took 1 bite.  I didn't even see the chocolate explosion on the menu... very disappointing.  It would be good, if it was cheaper - but at $140.00, you really want to be wowed...  and that hasn't happened.~~#~0
I was truly impressed by the quality of service and the knowledge of the employees. I have had my ears pierced at Claire's when I was 4 (way to go, Dad!) and an industrial piercing performed at Club Tattoo. I went in to adjust my bar bell for my industrial piercing and they explained a lot of things I had no clue about, like the difference in threading. The place is clean and every one is friendly. I will ONLY ever go to HTC when I need to handle my current piercings or want to get another. Thank you!~~#~1
Check this out...I JUST HAD A RUBEN FOR BREAKFAST!!!!! I saw the article about this place in the Tempe newspaper. We were already heading to the Healing Field at Tempe Town Lake9/11/10 and wanted to stop for breakfast. We had the dogs with us so choices were limited. My boyfriend went into Stan's and they let us sit on the patio with the pups. They serve their entire menu all day. I'm not a huge eggs and bacon kind of person so I love having something a little different in the morning. I ordered the Ruben and allowed Kelly the waitress (who was fabulous) to choose the side. The food took a little while to arrive. When it did...Holy Cow!!! My sandwich was huge and she brought all three sides so we could taste them all. That is great customer service! My favorite was the slaw, then potato salad. The food was fabulous and the staff was more than accommodating. The owner stopped by our table and chatted awhile. I will no doubt be back. Thank you so much Stan's for the wonderful start to my day!~~#~1
Pretty tasty dogs.  Pretty long wait for a hot dog.~~#~0
Today was my coworker's birthday and this was his choice for lunch.  All in all it was pretty good, some place I would go back to.The chips and salsa - the chips were nothing special, but the salsa was very good - both a green and a red one were served.I ordered the enchiladas suizas, beef, with green chile.  They were pretty darn tasty.  The beef was a little dry, this was the only drawback.  They had great flavor.  I even finished the rice and beans - which I rarely do.I get very disappointed when I order enchiladas and I get a plate that is swimming in grease and/or enchilada sauce and/or drowning in cheese.   None of that happened here, which was fantastic!~~#~0
We have been here now several times.  This Is one of the best restaurants we have ever been to.  The food and service is absolutely the best.   Most everything is cooked in their exposed kitchen.  Everything off the grill is awesome.The servers will patiently answer all your questions and appear as though they really enjoy seeing you pleased with your experience.Since we have been here several times here is a list of some items we have had:For one, if you don't mind spending the money the toro "tour" is great.  They have something like 5 different kinds of toro.  From real fatty to a little less.  Melts in your mouth.  The presentation is very impressive.  It is served on ice with different kinds of salt and (to us) a very unique way of presenting the wasabi.All there other sushis are served perfectly preparedThe steak is excellent.  The flavor is spectacular,  grilled in view over an open flame and quite literally cooked, always and without fail, exactly to you specification.All tempura dishes are greatGrilled zucchini.... Very good and juicy.Seabass with miso.  Cooked perfectly.I suggest you order to share and sit at the counter.  It makes for a very good experience.  This is the place where you should go in without worrying about cost.  Just go for it, tske your time and experience it all.  It will make for a very good experience.Try their very unique drinks, they are very refreshing.Or, if you are real daring, the tasting menu is literally a 4 hour experience.  Did it once.  It's a bit long for us and wont do it again.~~#~1
Love the pita jungle!!!  My fave is the chicken and hummus appetizer.  Definitely enough for a meal and super cheap too.  Also love the chicken swarma sandwich and the chicken pizza.  You can't go wrong here.~~#~1
A must when you visit the Heard.   The staff is very professional.     James, Lora and Allison are excellent.     The shop is first class.   Great place for a collector.      Some of the finest Native American art available.          Highly recommend a visit.       You will be amazed.~~#~1
Pretty decent food. Friendliness of staff is hit or miss.~~#~0
Great flavors even though there aren't many to choose from! Fresh fruit is such an awesome feature as most places are def not and limited to the healthy choices of topping! I visit as often as I can!!~~#~1
Great facial great customer serviceOne Love Boutique Spa consists of the waiting room/reception area and the services room.  Its small, cozy but super cute and inviting. I love the way it's decorated which is what drew me to buy a Groupon for a signature facial after looking at the website. The decor is white, clean, girly and classic.I was disappointed at first when my initial appointment was cancelled two hours before I was scheduled due to Amanda coming down with something that was contagious, I guess I was thankful too.When I came in for my facial I explained that I was one of the appointments that was rescheduled due to her illness and she upgraded me to the anti aging facial for free!  She also includes eyebrow waxing with every facial which is awesome! The facial was AMAZING and Amanda is very knowledgeable about what she is doing and the products she is using. Before my facial started I had asked her to mess up my hair as little as possible since I was going somewhere right after, she kindly obliged  and when I left my hair looked exactly how it looked when I came in.Amanda is great and I will definitely be back!~~#~1
The best street taco's i've had.  As authentic and cheap as it gets...If you do take out, pick up a bombaros burrito for lunch for the next day as well, its really hot, but tasty.Don't tell me ATF or any other spot is better, they dont come close unless you like your "street tacos" with sour cream, cheese and lettuce LOL.~~#~1
My niece want to go here for her birthday, on a Friday night.  The wait was about 30 min.  The onion blossom was not as crispy as I remember but still pretty good. Its horseradish sauce was stronger than I expected.  I had to ask for a side of ketchup.  My steak was cooked as ordered (medium rare) but lacked taste somehow; the lobster tail was grilled right.  The steak of my niece was on the dry side (overcooked). My daughter's steak was as she liked it (medium rare).For dessert, we shared a gigantic scoop of ice cream and whipped cream and an Oreo waffle with more ice cream and whipped cream.  We couldn't finish.The service was good. Our waitress was very friendly.~~#~0
Another "do-it-yourself" bridal shop with rows of dresses tightly packed on racks in big plastic bags.   The woman was super quick swapping out the dresses in the room.  As soon as I walked out in a new dress, she had the old one out and the new one ready to go and waiting for me in my room.  I might have rated this store a bit higher, but I didn't seem to have any luck here.  Dresses were either way too big or way too small and I just didn't find any that I liked.  I have heard of many people having success here and the prices are reasonable, just didn't work for me.  The dress shopping continues. . .~~#~0
Found this place by accident.  Not the greatest location.The pulled pork rates about an 8 on my scale.  Didn't need sauce, but the sauce (sweet) was good.  The Ranch beans are a tad spicy but still good.  The slaw needs a little help.I will definitely go back and sample the rest of the menu.~~#~0
I love Jimmy Johns!~~#~1
NOTE TO SELF/OTHERS: Check zoo hours before going.  Apparently they close at 4.  On a Saturday.  When it's beautiful weather. Maybe that's an obvious close time to everyone else but we sure were disappointed.I guess there is a whole slew of stuff we missed seeing, and some other exhibits we passed were closed for a wedding.  I guess it's cool to get married in the orangutan exhibit.  Or else the orangutans were getting married.  (Maybe those anti-gay marriage folks were right in that it would lead to animal marriages??!)Anyways, we all know it's not the greatest of zoos because it's freaking hot half the year and it's not super nice to subject a lot of animals to 115 degrees.  But it's a decent enough selection, they have friendly staff, it's clean, and they have free parking. GD I love me some free parking.Lots of the "learn more by pressing this button" things didn't work.  At least one water fountain didn't work (but hey- it was conveniently next to an overpriced soda machine!).  Like most other zoos they make you exit through the gift shop, so your wee ones can spend the car ride home crying about how they didn't get x overpriced toy/stuffed animal.I do think if your kids are young enough, you could probably just take them past the ticket counter and check out the animals you can see below the bridge/in the water. Those ducks, fish and turtles are FREE to see, and what 1 or 2-year old needs the whole menagerie anyways?~~#~0
I used to always go here for tires until my mechanic noticed my tires were the incorrect size.  Back to Discount I go to correct the problem, and they blamed me. I was told that I must have chosen the smaller tires to save 20 bucks a tire.  I ended up having to spend a lot of money on five new tires (my spare is a full size as well) three weeks before Christmas. I wrote the company a letter to tell them how wrong I felt the entire experience was, and I never heard anything back.  I will not be going here for future tire needs.~~#~1
The music is pounding...It reeks of ridiculously strong cologne masking young adult male insecurity...Some guy younger than my kid brother is walking around without a shirt...Everything is super overpriced for what you get...In the grand tradition of overcompensation and brand whoring there is a name plastered all over everything...No one is genuine either in their efforts to help or able to make real eye contact and stop texting...Is it a bar in Belltown in the late 90s? Is it a frat party? Is it a spring break trip?No, it's Pimpercrombie & Bitch! Now I remember why it had been at least ten years since the last time I walked in one of these cesspools of humanity and child labor sweatshops. Maybe next time I will wait 20 years...if they make it that long.~~#~1
Torn between review Fez Foodies, the periodic event that allows patrons to participate in sampling yet-to-be-added menu item and tweak them based on responses and the actual restaurant that hosts said event and providing a CenPho restaurant that combines innovative cuisine with ambiance and amazing service, I settled on the latter. Because without the brick-and-mortar there would be no former. So, tonight for the first time Robert M and I joined the Fez Foodies for a sneak peak at a few items that will be coming to a plate near you. The raspberry spinach salad was wonderful. The steak with mushrooms and smashed red potatoes might need another consideration but was still a pleasant entree. Honestly, I look forward to returning and getting these items, because Fez actually takes customer input/suggestions and applies them. Fez is one of those locations where I've never gotten anything but terrific service and a great meal. I'm fond of the garlic and rosemary fries but my coworkers and friends and strangers on the light rail think I should limit myself on these as some people don't appreciate the proven medical benefits of bucket-loads of garlic and shovelfuls of rosemary. Tools. Not surprisingly, Thomas was a peach of a host. Forgive me if I seemed disinterested in conversation: we just returned from Rim Country and that experience killed my ass.~~#~1
Ahhh Shady's...I am a little embarrassed to admit how often I frequent this gem of a place, but definitely not ashamed of how much I love it.  Cool atmosphere, just the right lighting (very important to me), great bartenders, good prices on a really nice selection (Who else has Old Raj gin or Agwa De Bolivia?).   This is definitely not a dive bar (not that there's anything wrong with that), but it's not an icey, blase Snobbsdale-ish joint either, and I've never felt ridiculed or snubbed here either by patron or bartender.  I've seen all walks of life come through this place, but never felt that it was too 'hip' or pretentious in any way. Great jukebox, obscure, forgotten movies playing on the telly, bartenders that are nice to look at (male and female), have personality and actually remember your name (and drink).  Does it get any better than this?~~#~1
I really enjoy this place. It's beautifully designed. It's hidden in a historic neighborhood, (zoning issues so no patio), and they make they own tonic! ---What else does one need? But now the food. Rich, full flavored, comfort food. I don't think there is a cuisine style here as far as I could tell, just some of the best food around. Had the fontina crusted with pinko and walnuts, awesome. A potato side dish, damn good I tell you. For the main course the skirt steak, which was some of the best red meat I'm had in a very, very long time. This is my vote for best new restaurant in Phoenix. Seriously.~~#~1
Excellent! I love this place!~~#~1
Staff was very rude, bowling prices weren't displayed to the best of their ability, extreme bowling itself was over priced almost $20 per person. The only thing about their extreme bowling was that it was extremely hot, temperature wise. they had many ceiling fans and not one of them turned on. And the bowling equipment malfunctioned three times during our games. It was not a pleasant experience and I don't believe we'll be going to this facility again.~~#~1
Okay ya wanna know a little secret? I LONG for Green. Ever since moving back to New Orleans I'm surrounded by an embarrassment of culinary riches but our one vegetarian restaurant can never hold its own against Green. I passed through Scottsdale a few weeks ago to visit the Grand Canyon and the second I stepped off the plane at the Phoenix airport and secured the rental car we drove straight to the restaurant. Everything was just like I remembered it and slightly better. The staff was warmer and the food just as good. I'm still thinking about the "crab" puffs and the eggless rolls.~~#~1
As someone who LOVES Thai food, I can really appreciate a good Pad Thai, and Wild Thaiger's is my favorite hands down!Just like the menu says, their Pad Thai has a plethora of intense flavors, to the point where every bite is unique.  If you love Pad Thai and haven't tried Wild Thaiger's, you need to.  If you don't love Pad Thai, it's probably because you haven't tried Wild Thaiger's.  :)  Seriously, this is one of the best dishes I've found in Phoenix.Their other dishes are consistently good as well.  I love Chicken Satay, but most places only offer it as an appetizer, with a few skimpy chicken strips.  Wild Thaiger, on the other hand, has a filling Peanut Chicken lunch, as well as a Peanut Passion dinner, both drenched in their delicious peanut sauce.  Their curries are very flavorful and make for a superb and hearty dinner, but if you're going for lunch, you may want to consider Thai Basil up the road as their curry lunch combo includes a salad and other extras.Their Thai Tea is strong yet creamy, just like it should be, and you can even add boba to it.  A must if you're eating anything spicy.The service is very professional and timely.  The atmosphere is pretty classy, in fact, it's probably the nicest-looking Thai restaurant I've been to.  It's also the only Thai restaurant I can think of with a patio.  All in all, it has a very welcoming atmosphere.  I would feel just as comfortable here in a suit as I would a T-shirt and jeans.  It's a great place for dates, business lunches, or just some great take-out.  You might spend a tad bit more here than at some other nearby joints, but the quality more than makes up for it, I would say the prices are spot-on.One day I'll learn how to write a review that's short and sweet, but I kept thinking of good things to say about this place.  Highly recommended!~~#~1
ok so here's what they teach:  if you are a good person it is right and good for you to take from others and give it to yourself, because you deserve it and everyone else is a bad person.  Stealing is okay, lying is okay, as long as it is done by you, but for the others, they have no place in society, so pillage and destroy them, it is your right and you will be rewarded for that.  Wow.~~#~1
Wow, I am very impressed. The store is very big, and they seem to have it all - even the hard to find, odd items. It looks like everyone can shop here.The store is mapped out and sectioned nicely too. Finding things is easy, and if you can't (or don't want to) the very friendly staff are there to help. It looks like they employ people who know a thing or two about the supplements also... so whether you are looking for: digestive health, immune support, weight loss, muscle building, herbs, beauty or whatever; they have it, and they can tell you about it! Pretty Good! You can even get a customer rewards card and build up bonus points to get discounts and stuff. And they can track your purchases with it should you ever (like me) loose your receipt!What I am really impressed with though is their customer service and return policy. I did not expect them to accept a return and refund my money on 2 items that I purchased there because I lost the receipt. Especially, since I did not purchase it on a member card so they could not track my purchase either. I thought I would try my luck with it anyway and was hoping for an exchange. Well, the clerk was so nice to me. She said that it was no problem and would gladly refund my money (I didn't even ask for a refund)... and I had opened one product. I was speechless and felt a little guilty about it too - since it was almost a month that had passed (I really didn't think they'd take them back). Anyway, I told her that an exchange would be more than appreciated, and she said, "No problem:-)" again! So I very guiltily walked over to get some of the items I needed. They had them and they had them on sale - cheaper than I have ever seen and in more of a selection too. Needless to say, I walked out of there very happy (but feeling a bit undeserving). But that is what good - EXCELLENT - customer service is all about - exceeding the customer's expectations! This I my new store for all of my supplements and health & wellness needs. I recommend checking them out. They seem to have everything one could ever need. Plus, they have an entire wall (and more) dedicated to muscle, weight and fitness - if that is your thing! Also be sure to check out their website; they even have customer reviews & ratings! and product information/facts and ingredients. Really Cool!~~#~1
I love this place!!! The first time I went I fell in love with their fries and their secret sauce. They have those great crinkle fries and they are made to order so they come out super crispy and hot. They alone can stand on their own but I have to have the sauce. It has to be a mixture of ketchup, mayo probably some chili powder and some other stuff that I can't figure out. No matter how many times I try to do it at home I never get it. Once before I got the Italian Beef but being my first time I didn't know that you could get it wet... Duh... and ended up eating a warm roast beef sandwich that was a bit on the dry side. After reading the Yelp reviews I realized that you can add all kinds of stuff to it. I think that the girl at the register should've at least informed me that I had options. The staff (girls at the register) weren't all too friendly which makes for a less than pleasant experience right from the start. Hopefully they aren't there anymore. Forward to today I decided to give it another shot and I am so glad I did. The owner is a really cool guy and is always super nice when I come in. He asked me all the questions about how I wanted the sandwich and put the dip in a to go cup for me so I wouldn't have a mush sandwich when I got home. I added provolone and hot giardiniera which absolutely made the sandwich. I didn't get to finish it because my other half smelled it and swooped in and polished it off and loved it too. Good thing I got the fries! I would highly recommend this place. If you do have the Italian Beef you should try to eat it there instead of taking it home. If you get embarrassed easily or worry about food all over your hands and face then don't eat this infront of other people. I think it once you eat it you won't even care if it gets in your hair. So I say get over it and get your butt down to Lobbys and eat til you explode!~~#~1
Love it. Wish it was in my neighborhood.~~#~1
I'm giving Yoli's 5 stars for the winning combination of great food for a great price at a quaint location.Went there on a Saturday late in the morning and we were seated right away.  Great little hideaway in downtown Chandler.  I ordered the Morning Monte.  It was delicious.  My family ordered various other items and we all sampled a bit off each others' plates and everything was excellent.  My favorite item was the chorizo burro.  Excellent chorizo with the correct combination of meats and spices.  The waitress was friendly and we chatted with the owner and she was very nice also.Another really great thing about this place is the prices.  I don't think there are any items above $8 and most meals here are in the $6-$7 range.  Very reasonable for the good quality food you get.After breakfast we took a walk around the courtyard and had a nice time looking around at the plants and exotic birds they have on site.  We also got a chance to meet the owner of the property and she was super nice also.  I will definitely be back to try out some other menu items.~~#~1
This place has amazing frozen yogurt! I had the strawberry with small pieces of fresh strawberries! It was a wonderful treat in this heat, since it's yogurt and not ice cream, it's a little bit healthier.~~#~1
I was on my way into Sweet Republic just before Christmas when I spotted Painted Pretzel a few doors down.  Since I love pretzels, I was imagining all sorts of delights.  Hard pretzels in knots, twists, and rods covered with the finest chocolate.  Freshly baked soft pretzels salted, or rolled in cinnamon and sugar, or butter and garlic.  You name it.  They were going to sell it.Well I was sorely disappointed.  Upon entering, I realized this is probably more of a mail order type business.  No soft pretzels, either.  They specialize in pretzels dipped in chocolate and topped with nuts, candy pieces, etc.  There were some boxes of pretzels already made up, and we purchased a few.  The honey wheat pretzel rods were actually pretty good, the small bite-sized pretzels were nothing special.  The chocolate was a nice quality, but not the best.  Although they hand dip all the pretzels, they do not make the actual pretzels.  So if you're on a local foods kick, which I'm not, this isn't the place for you.  Not bad to have around the house and for gifts to pretzel lovers or corporate gifts as they are better than the products you would find in most grocery stores.  I was just hoping for a little more.~~#~0
I do not like this KFC ...or any really for that matter. Every time I have been here the place is filthy. I know they remolded the place and I have not been since then, so I am not sure if the conditions are the same.The food is just not good in any way anymore. Not that it was ever great, but you could get some decent chicken and some sides and be content. What the hell have they done to the mac & cheese? It is so gross..the color is just not appealing and the taste is worse. Food at this place has been served under temperature enough times to keep me from returning.~~#~1
So I'm not a big Chinese food fan, but my husband is. Truth be told, it usually makes me sick. But if I were to go to Chinese food, Dragon Palace would be one of the places that I would go. The food is decent and there's a lot of it. I really felt I was getting my value's worth.The waitstaff was attentive (always there asking if I wanted a refill) and the food came out quickly. It looks like every other Chinese food restaurant in the world (lots of red and gold, lanterns, paper Chinese Horoscope place mat -- save for the deep teal walls).  I'm not sure I would make a long drive to Dragon Palace because chances are you have a comparable Chinese food restaurant nearby, but if you live in the 32nd St. and T-Bird vicinity, this is certainly a Chinese food place worth trying. As for the food, we ordered the Peking dinner for 2 which came with won ton soup, a pu pu platter (consisting of won tons - yum -, eggroll, a small fried shrimp, a skewer of glazed beef and honey chicken), Peking fried rice (fried rice with shrimp, chicken, pork and beef), Mongolian beef and the house chicken. (as an aside and a disclaimer, I am preggers right now and I have developed a severe dislike for chicken which means I, of course, hated the chicken dishes). My husband thought it all was ok. I really liked the won ton soup and the Peking fried rice. After dinner, we got the requisite fortune cookie ("Express yourself now." WHAT?) and a really yummy banana wrapped in a won ton and fried with a sugar glaze thing.All in all, it was a good time at a pretty good Chinese Food Restaurant.~~#~0
Just a quick review to reiterate how truly great this place is.They've got soda, lots of soda.  That's right, I said soda! They've got root beer, sarsaparilla, freaky foreign sodas, teas, waters and other things. I love this place, I have no complaints. The only thing that would make this place better would be the addition of beer. Man, if these guys hooked up with the dudes that run the beer section of Topps  Liquors it would be unstopable!~~#~1
Dammit - I have been here a dozen times and it's been so "mixed"... The best of times, and the worst of times... though the last two times (for late night drinking with friends) have been pretty fun... Drinks are cheap and the crowd is "lively".So, for now, I will suggest Dos Gringos to the college drunkard and/or professional drinker after 9pm. Bring some friends!~~#~0
All I can say is DELICIOUS!!!  Service was great, food was great ,and the restaurant looks beautiful.~~#~1
So, Jimmy Woo's. One thing that can't be argued is that they had a great interior decorator, right when I walked in, I loved the vibe. We were seated immediately, and promptly served. The service is excellent and efficient :) We started with the egg rolls as an appetizer which were dee-lish-ous! And I ordered off their fancy drink menu and got a Jimmy Palmer, yum! For entrees, which they serve family style, we got the Shanghai Delight (broccoli, snow peas, and shrimp in a sauce) and the Chinese Braised Short Ribs. It was pretty good food, a little less sauce though on both dishes would have been preferred. The shrimp was cooked alright, and the ribs were very tender with a somewhat smoky taste. Again, if there had been less sauce, I think I would have enjoyed it even more. Like a lot of other posh Chinese food places, as my mother said after we'd left, "Jimmy Woo's is simply glorified American-Chinese take-out." It's true, but it makes for a pretty good dinner in Old Town.~~#~0
Fried Squash blossoms!  How do they come up with this stuff?  FnB gets 5 stars for creativity and service... oh, and the food is pretty amazing too!   The menu changes with the season, so I apologize in advance for making your mouth water by mentioning  food you'll probably never taste.   We started off with the appetizer special, Fried Squash blossoms stuffed with burrata served with fresh tomato sauce, and an order of naan with eggplant puree.  The Naan plate was nothing special, but the blossoms were fantastic.  For dinner Hottie had the lab chops with couscous and I had the pasta with butternut squash and pesto.   The pasta was amazing, I watched the chef make my pesto to order... mmmm basil!  Hottie devoured every bite, so I would say he enjoyed his chops too.  For desert we shared the panna cotta with cherries, it was the perfect ending to a great meal.  This place gets 5 starts all the way, from the moment we walked in, the service was impeccable and the food was superb.  Thank you FnB~~#~1
best in the valley~~#~1
So a friend of mine went here last Friday, and they were double charged.  The bartender took advantage of the situation and threw out the receipt to avoid cancelling the $60 amount. Which she claims and assumes was her tip (on a $60 bill). "I get a 100% tips!" umm..yeah.. I think I will skip this place for sure!~~#~1
Terrible food, terrible service.I ordered chicken fried rice. The waiter brings me a bowl and says, "chicken fried rice, right?" I look into the bowl and it's a bowl of brown rice. This must be a joke. I tell him that's wrong, and next me brings me a bowl of rice, seemingly fried?, with vegetables and no chicken. I bring that back to the counter and say my order had chicken in it, bringing my receipt along. So finally, they bring me a bowl of chicken fried rice.Or at least their version of it.I didn't think it was possible to actually screw up something as simple as chicken fried rice. The rice itself was cheap long grain rice. It was inedible due to the how stale/hard it was. Like absolutely no water absorption. And the rice was all covered in something that made it very wet and practically slimy. Disgusting. I have no idea how people can eat this.Oh, and that server who brought me the brown rice and claimed it was fried rice tried to bring lettuce wraps to the table next to me saying it was their salad. There's a nice picture on the wall which shows you what the salad is supposed to look like, and it's not lettuce wraps.The best thing about my meal was the fountain drink, which cost $1.85. The Circle K in the same plaza has bigger cups for 99 cents.~~#~1
When you walk in, it's dark and relaxing. The atmosphere is nice, quiet, with alot of dark wood highliting the place. The food is good, but be careful because the price can add up quickly. This will always be a restaurant I go to, with burgers and steaks and spinach dip. The best way to think of this place, is a lower grade of Houstons. It's almost there, but not quite.~~#~0
Dr. Koch and his staff are wonderful! I know that I am in great hands and being given the best care possible. They do a great job at working you in to the schedule if you have a last minute pain that needs some extra attention. I would highly reccomend Arizona Chiropractic to anyone!?~~#~1
My wife and I found Four Peaks by chance. We got lucky. The food was great, service was great, and all thr beers rocked. My wife's fav was the Heff and the Arizona Peach. We got a beer glass to remember the occasion and plan to swing by on the way out and grab a growler.~~#~1
I have been to Cherryblossom countless times for lunch over the past few years. I have to say the location kinda sucks, but that's because of all the traffic. Are they ever going to finish construction on Camelback?! Any way, I decided to get a to go lunch order today. Since it was actually chilly out, I ordered the cha-shu ramen noodles with a couple of their yummy bread rolls & also picked up a slice of their amazing blueberry bread. The rolls were yummy as usual & I ate half of the cha-shu, so good & a big enough portion for me to have it again for lunch tomorrow. Service can be slow there sometimes, it's best to go at 11am or after 1pm, to beat the lunch crowd. Other tasty items I have enjoyed here are: cali crunchy roll, double shrimp crunchy roll, grilled chicken salad (w/ginger dressing instead), calamari, edamame & I have tried a couple different pasta dishes which were surprisingly good!~~#~1
Navajo Food at it's best !!!!!! I loved everything there ! I guess I love "BLAND" food . :-) everything was terrific ... I ordered the bowl (12 oz) of Mutton Hominy Stew I got it with the Tortilla bread which was AMAZING ! I also ordered a side of Blue Corn Mush to dip into my stew ( which is an awesome combination) ... And I also ordered a Grape Shasta Soda :-D ... My Husband ordered the Vegetable Mutton Stew with fry bread and ordered Strawberry Shasta Soda. He loved everything !Everything was well worth the wait and the food was extra hot and tasted very FRESH !!! I LOVED IT !~~#~1
Brought a friend from Louisiana here.  She says that the crawfish etouffee here is the best she's had outside of Louisiana!~~#~1
UPDATE: This location is closed. Boo!~~#~1
Wow. Best breakfast I had on my recent trip to Scottsdale. Ordered the eggs benedict with a side of corned beef hash. Waitress sweet talked the cook into making a side order since they typically don't do side dishes. That sweet little angel of a waitress made my day! Best corned beef hash EVER! Have I mentioned how awesome the waitresses were? And damn pretty as well. Double score.~~#~1
The name says it all. This is one hot bagel shop! This could be one of the best bagel shops I've found in Phoenix and I would have never expected to find it way up in North Scottsdale. This bagel shop is delicious. The bagels are large, hot, soft and extremely delicious. This local eatery has a line out the door on weekends and it's for a reason. The breakfast bagel sandwiches are to-die-for. The cheese, egg and bacon combo sandwiched between a hefty bagel makes it worth waking up early on a Sunday morning! I will be visiting again soon for the deli because I hear that it's a must to stop by and experience their lunch.~~#~1
A great restaurant staff! They go above and beyond for their customer.Try the buffet you will not be disappointed.Bacon is cooked to perfection. Fruit is fresh and the seating is perfect for large groups.~~#~1
Found Indulge on a whim, based on their huge "Gluten-Free Menu" outside - I was not disappointed when we decided to try it!Indulge has a separate gluten-free menu and the server was very knowledgable walking me through their kitchen processes to reassure me.  I ordered my burger on a gluten-free bun (!!!) the first time I was ever able to do this in a restaurant.  That was EXCITING!I think Indulge is as good as you make it - you are given a menu to check off ingredients for your burger.  They have SOOO many choices, that it's likely that if you don't like your burger, YOU made the wrong choice. I had no such problem - I loved my custom burger!  It was cooked to the correct temperature, was delicious & best of all, was delivered on a tasty gluten-free bun. PLUS, though I was full (it was a LOT of food!) I was able to take a gluten-free cupcake to go - wow, was that ever heaven later!  Thanks Indulge!~~#~1
Mellow Mushroom - WOWAs you may tell from recent reviews, I have been on a Pizza crusade. Well, I took a friend to Mellow Mushroom today and the pizza rocked.We shared the Thai Die Pizza which had curry chicken and tasted awesome. The crust was think and delicious the pizza burst with taste when I bit into it. I am a traditional pizza guy but this diversion worked.Great service and a nice patio to eat topped it off.I'll be heading back...soon~~#~1
Been here 2 times.  Had I reviewed after my first visit, I would've given the place 4 stars.  The server was nice and attentive and the food and drinks were delicious.  Had I reviewed after my second visit, I would've given the place 2 stars.  The server was quiet and not as attentive and the food was cold and bland.  Since I'm just now getting around to reviewing, I guess I'll give it 3 stars.  Really a bummer when you enjoy a place once only to go back and have a no-so-great experience.~~#~0
Pauli from ATL checking in here.... just for a bit of nostalgia...I used to live in Phoenix a few years back, and of all the places I miss eating at, this is #1 on my list.  I remember how I first heard of the place.... I was over at a friend's house in Scottsdale having a few beers after work, and remember asking him what his favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix was.  My friend, who had more than just a few beers in him, stared at me all glassy-eyed, got right in my face and said... "Cheeeeno Banddddeeedo!!"  As I backed up a bit, thinking my friend had too much to drink (he had, for sure), I wondered... hmmm...the Chinese Bandit?  What the hell is that place about?!?  Or is he just f***ing with me?  So, I asked him what kind of food they serve there... And, as he did his best to focus on me, when his eyes hit mine, there was this long pause.... and he had this expression on his face that I can't forget... I wasn't sure if he was having trouble putting it into words or if he was sh***ing in his pants.   And then he put his hands together, like a nutjob working a Rubik's cube.... and said, "They... dooo... things... like.... egg-foooo youngggg burrritos and jaaaade red chicken tacossssss...."..... as he gave me another crazy-ass look (the kind that tells you it's time to say goodnight and get outta there - which I did)....So, a few days later, I remembered his drunken explanation of Chino Bandido and thought I would go check the place out.... And from that point on, I was hooked.   Egg foo young burritos indeed!   And jerk fried rice!   And those refried black beans with fire-in-the-bungholio sauce mixed in.... Yep, those will burn you twice... All served in a giant disposable aluminum baking dish... And you got that combo, along with a soda and tip for about $10!!!   WOW!!  At that time, I had never seen anything like it before, and I still miss eating there more than any of my favorite old haunts in Phoenix.... I wish somebody would franchise one out to Atlanta - I would be the first customer in the door on opening day, guaranteed....~~#~1
Off the chainco's! lolToday my friends and I pondered what to eat.. a good sandwich was was we decided on but where? Looked right here on yelp and it came up.. most the reviews were good so we went for it. WOW.I like to ask for a knock my socks off never been here suggestion and he offered up the cheese steak, with peppers and mushroom. I went for it but was on the fence for my pasta side dish.. he handed me a sample of the tortalini and I was in heaven.Service was polite, the place was busy but not crowded, it was clean, and very appealing to look around while waiting for our order.  Took about 10 minutes to arrive, not bad.I thought the price was fair  and i could have went with just a half sandwich as it was very filling.While eating my buddy joked the place was off the chain.. and should rename itself to "off the chainco's" lolHighly recommended and cant wait to take others here.-Shawn~~#~1
A chain, yes. But par for the course, no. First of all, they have an extensive wine list, which includes a rare type of sparkling wine, called Brachetto. In this area, DUI's are more common than a cold, and it's a light and tasty wine, with a low alcohol content. So it's option is great for me. It also goes great with everything they serve, because of it's unique flavor profile.Lizzie was our waitress, and offered options and suggestions, which actually saved us quite a bit of money on the whole. Not that, by any stretch of the imagination, is this a place to go when you are not intending a big splurge. This is a place to take it slow and spend slightly over a decent amount. The food, however, is absolutely worth it. We tried the Cheddar fondue, which could have used a bit more mustard powder and worstershire sauce, but on the whole was delicious. It was well prepped, and Lizzie explained what she was adding and why the whole time. The veggie selection is a bit mundane, and that's really my only complaint. We ate the "big night out" prix fix menu and chose the "Fusion" option which had lobster tail, shrimp, brats, ravioli, new york strip, sirloin steak, and a marinated chicken. We cooked it in the Boullion method which is just a flavored broth. Because it's not oil, you do need to add 30 sec to a min to the suggested cook times, but it was a lot lighter than using the oil and we didn't come home smelling like oil. The california salad was incredible. It had mixed greens, sliced roma tomatoes, chopped pecans, and blue cheese crumbles with a rasberry black walnut dressing. It's been a long time since I was able to truly enjoy a salad, and this was amazing. The chocolate we chose was the Smore. It was milk chocolate, marshmallow creme flambeed with grahm cracker bits added after the fire goes out. It's served with 2 types of coated marshmallows, pound cake, a slice of cheese cake, and a bowl of sliced strawberries and bananas. Just enough to fill us up, but we didn't overstuff ourselves. Our dinner was leisurely paced and took us about 2 to 2 1/2 hrs to get through. This is pretty normal for fondue. You do have the option of sitting at the bar and having just a cheese or chocolate, if you are on a time constraint though. It's located in a great little shopping and dining area that wasn't too crowed last night, but I think that was more due to the weather, than the actual popularity of the place.~~#~1
Jason Silberschlag pulls off a pretty amazing thing here in the metro-PHX area.  Three shops with their own quirky details, passion and identity.  Each tailors specifically to the demographic at hand, which I can totally get behind.  The fact that each shop has its own deal going on is awesome - I really dislike chains and the chain feel/look.  I hadn't seen Jason in a while at the other shops, the times I'd frequented, and was happy to see him behind the bar when I came here for the first time.Just the same way the other Cartel shops have a selection of brewing methods, this one does as well.  Pour-over, aeropress, Chemex and traditional espresso (La Marz GS/3).As expected from him, our drinks were flawless.  He transfers this knowledge and passion to the baristas, which is obvious even when one leaves his establishment to go somewhere else - they stand out in the crowd of many coffee-pullers.  The beans, who can complain?  Jason made his name with the roasting.I got a prepared sandwich here, and my was it tasty.  Bread was fresh.  Sauce, ingredients and overall creation was good.  Big Ben: you stole my tastebuds' heart that morning.Casual lounge area (see: couches), outdoor covered seating (see: hallway - shaded and cool!) and plenty of seating inside.  As normal, his handiwork shines throughout the shop.  Somehow I've never reviewed a Cartel shop before, despite my years of patronage.  My latest experience changes that.~~#~1
I'm happy to say that I've incorporated Guedo's into my weekly routine.  The food is excellent and the atmosphere is spot-on. I've read several reviews where people complained about the food being overpriced but I really don't mind paying a little extra when it comes supporting local businesses; especially a staple of the community like Guedo's.  If you're looking for a place with awesome food and an owner who cares to learn your name, come to Guedo's.~~#~1
Overall I am a big fan of this place... first how can you beat a place that is BYO???!!!  You never have to worry about a bad wine list or paying too much because it is your own stuff...  I find the food excellent... they menu is not large and changes often...  but I have never had anything that I have no liked... the chef is defiantly 5 star and since you bring in your own wine the prices don't seem that bad... but it is not exactly cheap... The only down fall of the place is that it is real small and has funky hours... I think it is only open Wednesday to Saturday.  I know that they take reservations and I would venture to say that is the only way to actually eat there... This is a nice place for special occasions or a date...~~#~1
Pizza has been delicious and fresh every time I've been there. The Chipotle pasta is absolutely the best though.~~#~1
I love this place. They are so accommodating and the food is delicious. They made a special meal for my daughter and were happy to do it. Our server was helpful and friendly.  I had the roasted beet salad and the ingredients were very fresh and tasty. I can't wait to go back.~~#~1
Much better than the frozen variety.  Sort of better than the quick serve shop in the Fashion Mall in Vegas- from what I remember.  This place was just as I was expecting: way crowded at lunch time, over-priced pizza and drinks, and so-so service.The pizza I had with wheat crust that included eggplant, roasted red peppers, and goat cheese was pretty tasty.  I guess if you consider that I had a second meal out of the pizza, the price wasn't too bad.~~#~0
The Management Group at this location need to make a better effort to control the number of people jumping theaters.  My experience at this theater was one of the worst that I have ever had.  I will never go back to that theater again.  I felt that it was nothing but a complete money grab.~~#~1
i cant review restaurants in phx and leave out LGO. breakfast, coffee ambiance, service, pizza - 5 stars. happy hour 3 stars. Not very many places beat this place out for saturday or sunday morning coffee and or breakfast after a nice wrkout, run, hike or... anything else at home in bed with your better half. must see for my visitors~~#~1
I love the always smiling crew and food is delicious.50cents coffee in the morning outside tables with sun exposure and friendly clientele, all this in the beautiful kierland commonsGood morning America~~#~1
Honey Bear's is no Joe's BBQ in Gilbert but I actually enjoy it. I usually get the pork sandwich and potato salad and I find myself going here. I like the BBQ sauce and the quality of the meat is good. If I'm in Tempe and want BBQ I usually go here.~~#~0
Alas...I've given up the idea of writing a review for a place if it isn't at least 4 stars. Sue me; I'm in the industry. Fuego Bistro is by far one of the best places I've been to recently. I was introduced to it this last weekend on a date. Ironically, it's super close to my house yet I've never heard of it. When we were arriving, I was a little curious to see where the hell he was taking me since there aren't any signs really and it's pretty hidden. Once we were inside, though, it was like finding a little treasure.The patio is welcoming & even though we didn't have a reservation (aka we couldn't sit outside) we snagged a table close enough to enjoy the beautiful weather. We started off with a round of mojitos and even though it's been a few years since they've won best mojito...I can say the Prickly Pear was the best I've had in a while. The Ahi Tostadas followed & they were awesome...the sauce added a kick to it & it was a perfect start to the meal.After, we shared the Fuego Pasta with chorizo, chicken, mushrooms, peppers, & a chipotle cream sauce...huge! What I did eat of it was delicious. My favorite (and my date's I'm fairly certain) was the special...an herb crusted Mahi Mahi with a pineapple sauce, home-made cornbread, & chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes. Amazing. Even though the Mahi Mahi might be hard to come by if you visit, the two sides aren't & are so good, I'm droolin' just thinking about it. :)Dessert? Try the banana burrito. Heaven on the tongue!Kevin was an excellent server which just highlights the night. It's hard to have a great meal without great service but he provided just that.If you're in the area...check it out. If you aren't...check it out. I'm pretty sure you won't be disappointed.~~#~1
Wow!Being a Phoenix native, we have enjoyed many a meals at the hands of Chef Gross. But this past weekend I was blown away.I was planning a large garden party for my friends bridal shower. The record temperatures left my garden ravaged by the heat and I did not want to have sweltering ladies unable to enjoy themselves. After a small response to attendance, I decided to see what some of my favorite dining spots could offer me.I had a small budget but wanted to keep it classy. Christopher's truly rose to the occasion. Alex, was my special event contact and this lady was "on it". Emails and phone calls were returned at lightning speed. She presented a delightful menu with plenty of choices (some even for the vegetarians attending) all with in my price range. We had a wonderful time. We had a party of 18 in the beautiful private room that fit our festivities perfectly. Sundays can be quiet at The Biltmore Fashion Park so it lend-ed us to a bit of intimacy that was nice. Ben was our go to guy. He was right there for every thing we needed and his helpers were polite and attentive.As for the food, well, it's Chris, come on! I had the vegetable risotto ans  it was cooked to perfection. All of the plates came out of the kitchen quickly and all together but no one ever made us feel rushed. Wine flowed, desserts were gobbled up and the ladies oohed and awed over everything. the staff even offered to take gifts to the car for the bride.Thanks for saving me Chef Chris and your team. You were all fabulous and I will be telling all of my friends what a great job you did. The holidays are coming and Ben reminded us that they also do catering! Hmmm, can you say "Christmas Party"?~~#~1
The food on its own is very good, probably worthy of a four star rating by itself, especially considering how difficult it is to find even passable Italian food in the West Valley.  I bumped Grazie up from four-stars to five-stars because the service is very, very good, ownership is attentive and the atmosphere is very pleasant.  As for the pizza in particular: for a NY native, finding decent pizza in Phoenix is close to impossible. Good thin-crust (Italian-style, as opposed to NY- or Chicago-style), like what they have at Grazie, does happen to be a bit easier to execute, and Grazie does it well. Would I have loved to find a great NY- or Chicago-style slice instead? Sure, but good pizza is good pizza nonetheless.~~#~1
The 3rd star is because they have EVERYTHING.  And you can't beat the prices.  And as far as crowded, budget conscious mega stores, this is definitely on the cleaner side, even with their current renovation project going on.The dark side...  it IS a very crowded mega store, especially at the later hours.  And as crowded as it gets from 9pm-1am, there's usually only 2 checkers, which makes for LONG lines.  If you can hit this place during a quieter time, earlier mornings or early evenings, then you can get what you need without breaking the bank.~~#~0
WOW! Carmel sundae was amazing!~~#~1
Me and three girlfriends headed to La Bocca for Happy Hour after reading all the wonderful Yelp reviews. I was really excited on my way there, but left feeling underwhelemd. For me, it felt a little big, commercial, the decor was kinda cheesy - think red leather chairs, Pier1 Important wall sconces, even a "VIP" looking lounge in red velour. Hardly, original or intimiate enough to be considered an authentic "wine bar" in my opinion. If you're a regular at chain restaurants you'll probably think this is a cute place (call me a snob, whatever). Let's talk about the wine list at this "wine bar" --- it was okay but they were out of our first two choices of red - not ideal for a wine bar. Then, we ordered our bruchetta for our table of four and were annoyed when it came out cut in halves. Knowing we were sharing the plate, maybe the waitress should have clued us in? We ended up ordering a second board for the table so we could each try the variety. I do have to say, the bruchetta was good. We were clearly there for happy hour on a Wednesday night (which I do love goes until 6:30pm) but found it a little rude that the waitress came by six minutes after the mark to ask if we wanted a second round. There was no grace period so we paid full price. We did notice, that our full price glasses of wine were filled to the brim - so maybe 1/2 price = have the wine? Don't get me wrong... the place is cute enough, would def seem like a "fancy date night place" if I were still in college. I'd go again with girlfriends but won't be racing back with my husband. I wish we would have tried more food because that seems to be the key to this place. Ambiance and service are good - not great. Oh, and the music could use some updating. The playlist was... eh... interesting Maybe it's my love of Postino or maybe its because I was on Mill Avenue I was instantly judging the place.~~#~0
I have been to Kyoto about 3-4 times in the past 7 years.  I still hasn't changed a bit since the first time I went there when I was fifteen!  I always eat at the grills.  I love places with the tepanaki (I dont know how to spell it) grills.  I have been to many many places like this and Kyoto is just ok.  This place needs some serious redecorating.  It looks like the place is stuck in the 1970's.  The food is good though.  Last time our grill cook was really bad and was droping things all over the place but hey everyone has an off day sometimes.  I may go here again just because its so close to my home but otherwise I've had better.~~#~0
My husband and I were really, really disappointed with our experience at Coulter Infiniti.  We brought our 2006 G37 with barely 34,000 miles (and out of warranty) to have the moon roof looked at.  The moon roof wouldn't open or close, but you could hear the motor working.After leaving the car there all day we get a call that the car needs a whole new moon roof track - which would cost over $3000.  We contacted their corporate office to attempt to get some or all of the cost covered, due to the fact that it's a big repair and the car  is barely out of warranty.  We were flat out denied.  Twice.  We were dreading the big repair, and decided to bring the car to a different auto shop (which will get a big, fat 5 star review) for a second opinion.  Turns out the track just had a BUILD UP OF DIRT AND DEBRIS and needed to be cleaned out.  Seriously?!?!  Just over $100 later we were on our way!I find it VERY hard to believe that Coulter didn't know this was the problem.  We are now searching for a new SUV, and will not be choosing Infiniti.  How disappointing.~~#~1
I have have been going to Bosa off and on since they opened. Have a bad experience and stop for a while. Then I tell myself " It's right down the street why not " then disappointment again. 1. Went in on a Fri at 630AM for their special curler donuts, that they ONLY do on Fri. Sure enough nothing was prepared. Was informed it would take another 30 min to finish the donuts. Noticeable very, very, very irritated I ordered 2 other donuts instead. Was planning on a dozen, but had to settle for what they had. Well staff made sure to charge me a credit card fee due to my purchase being under $ 5.00. When you don't have what you advertise, you might want to waive the .50 fee. Or you will really piss off that customer. Common sense.2. Customer service is horrible. See #1.3. When I get home I have never received the correct dozen donuts I ordered. I don't understand it ???? I'm perplexed ??? I don't think it's anything personal. I just never get the correct dozen. They close the box, I pay and go home. Surprise.The donuts are OK nothing great and not bad they are donuts. They are convenient and close, but I must remember to pass on Bosa Donuts.~~#~1
Nobody likes going to the auto body shop..period! These guys took a negative situation and absolutely turned it around. They immediately made me feel at home from the moment I approached the front desk; all the way up to the ownership of the shop. It was a professional experience with a family friendly approach. The work they completed on the rear bumper of my car was excellent. I HIGHLY recommend Impact AB for your AB repair needs.Tom Butka was a pleasure to work with. Thanks Impact AB for everything!~~#~1
Good service. Excellent value. I went for the "All You Can Eat" deal they have from 2-9 PM and was there for a few hours. I'm not fat or anything, I just felt like finding a good place to study and eat for a bit. The server was pretty attentive and the kitchen staff was pretty fast. I was kind of disappointed that the menu for the all you can eat deal was missing many of my favorites from the regular menu, but there were still quite a few good choices.~~#~1
Must have eaten here a dozen times (used to work next door a few years ago). Nothing to amazing on the menu, the food is good overall but nothing I can remember really stood out. The best thing about the place is the location.I have noticed it has gotten considerably busier here as of late, maybe things are improving.They do offer Free Wifi which gets them some extra credit.*I have just been informed that new management has taken drastic steps to improve the place - I will visit and update this review ASAP~~#~0
My sis recommend this place for our weekly dinner. We shared on of the large appetizer platters (hummus, baba ganoush, tabouli and dolmades and two pitas). Very good and perfect for a light dinner. I would have to say the best thing was the fresh lemonade...wow! If you like tart you'll love this. I thought overall the service was great. Not only was our waitress extremely attentive but the manager stopped by to make sure we were enjoying our foodI give The Flaming Kabob 3 stars!~~#~0
This is one of my favorite go-to places in Phoenix, and I feel fortunate to live just a mile away. The atmosphere is excellent - low-lighting, wooden floors, modern decor in a vintage-looking house-turned-restaurant. The food is even better. I have never ordered anything I didn't love (with the exception of the cheesecake, which isn't made in-house - it was just okay). I crave their tuna salad on a regular basis - it's good both in the tuna salad salad and in the tuna salad sandwich.  The grilled cheese is the bomb, and so is the cashew butter banana sandwich. The mac and cheese is superb, as well. Seriously, everything rocks. I highly recommend ordering the mixed greens as your side if you get a sandwich - the dressing is light and citrusy and smacks of homemade excellence. Oh, and it won't empty your wallet, either. The prices are excellent for the quality of food you get!~~#~1
I hate to admit it (because I usually avoid ultra trendy places like an ex boyfriend) but I love Postino.  It used to be an old post office, thus the name.  It is now a wine bar that serves "light fare."  There are not too many places with this kind of atmosphere in the Valley -- very California.  One of the walls is a giant garage door that they roll up so the whole place is open.  Little couches and coffee tables are mixed in with tables and high tops for a variety of seating choices.  The bathrooms are lovely, clean, and lit by candles.  The salads are my favorite in Phoenix and the bruschetta is out of this world.   Come early, get your table and enjoy!~~#~1
I'm usually not a big buffet fan, but this place changed my mind!  It's very clean, good service, lots and lots of amazing dishes, AND really good sushi!  Weekend lunch was $14.99, but during the week it's $11.99. Well worth every penny. One more comment, this isn't the kind of buffet where "shifty people" go. The kind where you need to Purell your hands and arms when you get back to the table : )~~#~1
This review is directly for Joe that works at this specific location. From the first time I entered the store with my boyfriend, I can't explain how much of a help Joe has been. Not only is he knowledgeable about every product in the store, his warm character makes it an absolute pleasure to shop there. If it were up to me.... Joe would be a regional manager!~~#~1
The selection at this store is fantastic!  But I've come to expect the worst from the sales staff, the only hello you get are from the girls standing at the counter when you walk in and even that seems forced.  When I actually need help I feel as though I don't want to disrupt the employees in the middle of their very intense conversations.  I've learned to do my own  research on what ever it is I'm looking for before I go into this particular store.~~#~0
I am not religious, but I will be the first person to admit I thank God for this place--and the neighboring Windsor. Seriously... a latte, ice cream on a waffle cone and a cocktail all within feet of each other. Dear Lord, I have reached bliss. I can die happy now.Some people gripe that the flavors are not strong enough. I prefer to gripe that they aren't open 24/7 because this is my bliss and damn it... I need it at all hours.Always friendly.Always clean.Always awesome.Yes, there is heaven.~~#~1
"One, two Feddys coming for you!" "Three, four better lock your door!" "Five, six pick up a crucifix!" "Seven, eight better stay up late!" "Nine, ten if Freddy Kruger went to Lush he'd have had great skin!"Dude, this place is AMAZING! All of their products are all natural, freshly made without preservatives, and are just incredible.  My best friend and  went here after a four martini lunch plus shopping, and we had a had treatment done with their Ocean Salt Cleaner and exfoliator.  It is made with sea salt and smells just like a margarita!  his was followed by using their dream cream, and now I am hooked!  And it's not just the martinis!  I have very sensitive skin, and I have never had a reaction.  They also have a great men's line as well.  I have been using the Ambrosia Shaving Cream for men as well on my face, and I have no razor burn.  It is like a light cream that moisturizes while I shave.  Wow!  I have never felt good after a shave!Anyway, I could gush all day about this place, but the bottom line is it has incredible products that are all natural, and many are vegan,  the staff is amazingly helpful and not at all phony, and even though it may seem expensive the products last for a long time, so the cost is really not that high.  Get thee to Lush!~~#~1
I did not expect such a great find in a such a nondescript location. I went there looking for a very odd beer. Not only did they have it, they had tons of it. The guy behind the counter was helpful as soon as I walked in, and showed me exactly what I needed.They know what they sell very well, and can give excellent recommendations on whatever you might be looking for. It was great to talk shop with someone who obviously knew his stuff.~~#~1
I crave breakfast food all the time, but I want something more than an Ihop or Dennys. Not only is Crackers & Co way better than a mainstream breakfast place, it's actually cheaper too!I ordered the breakfast burrito without meat and it was amazing. It had just the right amount of spice and the portions were way bigger than I imagined. Their country potatoes are awesome and have nice, brown, crunchy edges. I went with a group of 5 people who all ordered different breakfast items and not a single person was disappointed with their food.This place was not only really cute but also great for the price and taste. Plus, they serve breakfast all day on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays.I can't wait to go back.~~#~1
Food is good. Coffee is too week and tastes like a lot of water added to it. They charge you if they add a shot to make it taste like regular coffee.~~#~0
Nearly 3 years after a Waikiki vacation, my longing for a Puka dog has been satisfied. Maui Dog is not exactly the same, nor should it be, but it has the same awesome concept, plus more! I've been here twice, once had a beef dog, the other a turkey dog. Both with mild garlic mayo & pineapple. These suckers are huge! And messy! And delicious! The dog has good flavor, mixed with the slightly sweet bun, spicy mayo and sweet pineapple...perfect! I think it would have been a better eating experience if my order was not to-go. The mess these things make all wrapped up is not pretty, but that absolutely does not deter from the taste. I can't wait till I have the time to eat-in and try the rest of their tasty-sounding menu!~~#~1
I will be moving to Phoenix in the Winter and I thought I'd scout out some LFS while I was visiting, which led me to Reef Culture. At first I was positive seeing some nice looking displays and LED use, however this soon changed. On closer inspection, lots of the tanks were infested with aiptasia and bubble algae, and prices of coral were hugely inflated compared to other prices in the area and back home. The people were very unprofessional and unfriendly and first ignored me entirely despite trying to flag someone down. When I did manage to get their attention, I was belittled and treated like a child who knew nothing about the hobby (I have had marine tanks for over a decade ranging from large 55 gallon+ to tiny DIY LED picos). After this rude and demeaning experience, I continued to peruse the last few tanks and came across an angler fish. I watched him and he followed me as I walked down the isle as far as his tank would go and I backtracked a couple steps, amused that he was slowly walking along the tank with me. There was a loud crack as the man behind the counter slammed the phone down, snapped his fingers at me, and told me to "stop harassing the fish." Keep in mind, I was not tapping on glass or prodding anything as I am quite short and I could barely reach to the high up tank where the angler fish was, much less reach to "harass" any fish. After this rude treatment I promptly left. This kind of unprofessional treatment of the customers is shocking and unacceptable, not to mention the bubble algae infested tanks (one spore of that on the water that you get your coral in and your tank is infected too). I won't be doing business here when I move.~~#~1
Very bad food!~~#~1
I love this place. I'm mostly here at dinner time to pick up my favorite roasted turkey artichoke panini and sometimes salad and soup as well! The staff is super friendly and recognize when my boyfriend and I show up, maybe because he can never leave without getting a dozen of their amazing cookies! The manager Kaylee is fabulous, she makes us feel right at home and is never unsatisfactory. They may have a smaller parking lot but I guess I have always had good luck with finding a spot! I know I will continue to come back for more.~~#~1
i dont know why i didn't fall in love with pita jungle sooner. i work right next to the mall so the food court is super convenient for us. let me tell you a story of how i ate here everyday for lunch for a week. i ordered a standard gyro with no pickles (they put pickles on their gyros and i find that disgusting) my coworker, jen, ordered the pasta salad with chicken on top. mine was delicious and i tasted hers. hers was so good! i was like, that's what i'm ordering tomorrow.the next day we went again and i ordered the chicken pasta. while waiting for the food to come out someone in front of me picked up their order of a hummus trio with chicken on top and a side of pita.the next day jen asked where i wanted to go to lunch. i said pita jungle and i got my hummus trio. and the trend continued. their food is so good!!!! and its like $8!! and since i work nearby i get a discount! today i had a side of chicken breast with super fresh mushrooms. i watched them steam them, then put them in a pan with w tons of garlic, red wine, and seasoning. some of the best mushrooms i've ever had and it was a HUGE order of mushrooms.i love this place!~~#~1
Love the DJ here! Good music & vibe. The servers are excellent! I love the decor and the lighting of the restaurant. However, food was... presentable but taste wise nothing special.Love their twist with cucumber water instead of lemon water! Two thumbs up for this!~~#~0
MEOW! This place is great - super clean, loaded with an amazing assortment of natural foods for both pooches and kitties, and two fridges jammed full with raw diet selections!  My four-footed kids were in heaven going through the bags!Not wanting to offend anyone in my bunch (it's impossible to travel anywhere with three dogs and two cats, while simultaneously maintaining any level of decorum), I went solo this weekend to support the latest AzRESCUE effort being sponsored by the store. In addition to them sending me home with a complimentary Yoghund for each of the kids, I got some great insight to private training that my youngest is in desperate need of if he ever hopes to be socially acceptable, and some great toys for the felines. The staff was unbelievably nice, they have some truly unique items, and the prices range from "wow that's pretty cheap" to OMG do I dare?!!!This is a great option to the chains and big box stores, so grab your leash, wag that tail, and pad your way on down to the Noble Beast!!!~~#~1
I really Love this place!I stopped in for lunch and tried a couple new things. The Ravioli di Zucca Appetizer (see pics) which is:roasted butternut squash ravioli with parmesan, brown butter,sage and crumbled amaretti...OMG it was just delicious but a perfect appetizer to share , it's available in two sizes I got the small one.The sweetness from the crumbled amaretti is a very nice touch.I ordered the Healthy Fish again (see pics) and once again it was perfect!My guest ordered the Penne Salsiccia (see pics) which had Italian sausage, caramelized onions and pecorino cheese! The sausage was really good and for just $5 you can't beat that!~~#~1
I dont understand how a second restaurant was opened on Tatum . My husband and gave these place too many chances and wach time the food was not impressive. The margaritas come from a stolen recipe from La Pinata Nueva , but too bad they didnt bring the recipes with them. I hope they get it " that maybe if you put alittle quality in the food people will come back".~~#~1
This place was good, just not as good as I had hoped based on the reviews.  I would have given the place 3 1/2.  Since I can't, I decided to balance out another reviewer who gave the place 4 stars but also thought it deserved 3 1/2.Positive notes:  Hot sauce had some bite to it, chips were good, Camarones culichi had a wonderful sauce.  Lots of fresh limes served with the meal.  Full bar.Not-so-positive notes:  Shrimp in the Camarones culichi was overcooked (cardinal sin for a seafood place).  The shrimp coctail was just ok - good sized boiled shrimp, but not too much flavor.  If driving by and hungry I would stop in again, but not if I have to drive too far out of the way.~~#~0
Lee's is the best privately owned ice cream parlor in Scottsdale! Located in Old Town Scottsdale in the heart of some prime dining locations, Lee's is a great night cap in the form of ice cream, a superb place to bring a date or all in all just a wonderful atmosphere to enjoy some ice cream con alcohol. Let's start with the aesthetics; Lee's offers a very clean, small, cozy environment.  A few table and chair sets dot the inside and a couple more to match on the outside. Lee has some awesome glass vases on the wall that add a modern touch. She has a few large clocks with different time zones so you know what time it is on the east coast while you eat? I dunno the clocks were kind of a head scratcher.The Service is spectacular! Lee is the only help I've ever received there, so I am not sure if she works alone or has help. She is always timely and prompt to greet and serve you and automatically starts you off with TWO samples of which ever flavors you would like. All the young ones like myself be prepared to show ID, although you would have to eat a lot of ice cream to get loaded, Lee doesn't skimp on the booze either. Lee is usually a bit on the quiet side so you gotta listen up and be as patient with her as she is with you. The lady is running the joint by herself! The Product is what makes Lee's so good! Her ice cream flavors are inventive and wonderful. There is usually new options as well a few solid customer favorites too choose from. As pre-mentioned Lee does pack a fair amount of liquor in her ice cream so some of the flavors have a stronger alcohol flavor than others. The Jack Daniel's chocolate swirl is my personal favorite and has the perfect amount of bourbon to chocolate ratio to make a unique, delectable treat. Lee does offer non-alcoholic flavors (at a discounted price, too!) for those opt to take there alcohol and ice cream separate. The cookie dough flavor may be the best ice cream I have tried with or without booze.~~#~1
Juan Jaime's is where the simple taste of Mexico are served with delectable results.  The kitchen produces vibrant fiesta flavors that left me wanting more. The simple menu offers approachable, exciting, delicious food that satisfies any appetite.  The Margarita's flavor should be praised. And the staff is top notch.  This is just what Chandler needed.  If you go ask for the Grilled Mahi Mahi.  You'll thank me later.  I can't wait to go back.~~#~1
Coffee talk is a nice surprise nestled in the hum drum downtown of Mesa. I have been enjoying their coffee and live talent since I was fifteen. When I was in High School it was a ritual to hit the local dollar movie and then end the night with some coffee at coffee talk. I think the best part was hitting on boys and trying to pass as being at least eighteen years old. My reasons for going to Coffee Talk have changed over the past decade, but the atmosphere and quality drinks and pastries have not changed. There is nothing better than sitting on their back patio and enjoying the cool breeze of the fall. There is something about that place that brings me a sense of relaxation. If you enjoy artistic ambiance, coffee, and live performance's then I would recommend Coffee Talk.~~#~1
My husband and I both rate this a 3. Food was good, but not great. Fresh veggies and nice flavors. Dont know if bread is made in house. The bread on my sandwich was falling apart, which made it difficult to enjoy.  I think the owner or manager was there, and I expected him to be introducing himself or welcoming us in some way,  but he seemed to be hard at work. I think as a new business, it would be a good idea to be more welcoming to people who are willing to try something new. Also,  there was a girl working there with a really dirty apron and she cussed while we were ordering. Very unprofessional and unsanitary, especially if the owner was there. Also,  wish they had a soup without a cream based broth. Maybe we'd try again for b reakfast?~~#~0
i was very disappointed in this place. i had driven far out to get here. i live in gilbert. i got the pinkbet, beef mechado and pork adobo. their portions are very measly. they are overpriced and their food wasnt very good or authentic tasting at all. the only thing i liked was the pork adobo.~~#~0
Horrible! I had a gel manicure. The tech didn't let my old gel soak off long enough so she scraped, clipped and filed so hard to get it off that it left my natural nail extremely thin and flimsy. The new polish that was put on was thick in some areas and thinner in others. I didn't realize it until I got home. I grabbed my purse and almost broke my naturally long nails because they were so frail. I get the gel manicure because it has a thicker finish and makes my nails firmer. I called and told them about what happened. The gentleman who answered the phone told me that I was wrong and that they would not refund my money. I will never go back and I am sure sorry I ever did in the first place.~~#~1
We were excited to check out this new restaurant! We were left extremely underwhelmed. We sat in the bar to watch MNF. It would have been nice to be able to hear the game over the discordant pop rock music at a mexican establishment but I understand that you are not a "sports bar". It was Monday night and with the exception of a large group  of blue hairs celebrating secretary's day the place was empty.  The bar area managed to fill up, because the Cardinals were on tv and it seemed as thought the high tops and patio were busy as well. Our bartender Amanda was very polite and eager to up sell us their flavored tequilas and specialty cocktails. You can tell she was a little wet behind the ears but she was doing her best nothing a little training and experience can't fix. The wait time to receive a cocktail was excruciatingly long though being a former bartender I understand the complexity that new bars go though to develop new and unique cocktails.  We ordered the pumpkin margarita. I applaud the attempt but personally it tasted like puréed baby food. I was feeling very open minded and wanted to experience as much as I could that TQLA had to offer so we ordered the salsa trio and chicken tortilla soup.  Queso dip: coldHabanero dip: sweet with a swift kick afterwards: not badGuacamole: good: but was gone after 2 bites. I guess they feel if they place the guacamole on a bed of green shredded lettuce it will look like there is more than delivered. FailChicken tortilla soup: Thick tomato soup with dry dark meat chicken chunks. Maybe it is just me but I prefer a more broth based ck tort soup and juicy white/dark meat chicken. Bleh: Amanda offered to remove it off our bill but I insisted on finishing mine because I was hungry. My GF pushed hers to the side; DNF. Meanwhile; whilst experience our starters we managed without any silverware or napkins and at this point Amanda being the only bartender on managed to become flooded with specialty cocktails in the well; thus not being able to properly oversee her patrons at the bar. Needles to say our drinks were empty, our plates, monkey dishes, empty bowl of chips, 2 cups of bland tortilla soup, saucers and wrinkled up black beverage napkins (used in the place of the real ones) were all tattering on the edge of the bar eagerly anticipating a bus boy to remove them. Onto the Entrees:I ordered the carne Asada steak.  My girlfriend tried the habanero chicken platter. They were delivered by TQLA manager "Joe". Whom decidedly pulled himself from enjoying the football game to expedite some food. He crept up behind us and shuffled the entree platters in front of our faces after we spread our dirty dishes closer to the edge of the bar and politely stacked them for our ficticious busboy/girl to remove them properly. Now in my history with management; a decent manager would offer to remove the collection of dishes but instead he decided to ask us if we needed anything else since the look on our faces was disgust. Instead we opted to inform Joe that we would enjoy our meal a little better with silverware and napkins.  He acknowledged that was a novel concept and proceeded to fetch us a pair. Joe wasn't six steps away before he was interrupted by a member of the waitstaff who informed him that what she needed was more important than delivering two setups to some first time customers so they could enjoy their ever increasingly cold food.  At this point my girlfriends temper got the best of her and she jumped up and retrieved her own silverware off of a table in front of Joe and eager waitress to salvage any heat that might have been left in our entrees. We dig in:  Carne Asada: was tender but lacking the Wow factor. Habanero Chicken: Tasted like a chicken breast smothered in their warm fire roasted salsa... What happened to the habaneros?  Where is the heat...? BlandI hope they get better: but until then Nandos all the way. Never saw Joe touch any tables, never offered to help out a bartender who was swimming laps in an Olympic size pool. Occasionally the wait staff would come behind the bar and help out.  This is about the time that our appetizers, chips, soups, and entrees were all removed from the bartop. FYI Joe, the hostess stand can hold itself up on its own. You don't have to stand there and hold it up. Keep an eye on your staff and customers and offer help where they need it so people will be happy to come back and give you a second shot.~~#~1
The novelty of this place garners it some brownie points, and you definitely don't come here for the food. Yes, scantily clad nurses will serve you your food, cheerfully chat you up, and be agreeable to a photo shoot at the end of your meal. You'll also appreciate the little things Heart Attack Grill does (i.e. conveniently placed mirrors at ass-level behind all the counters for any patron's ogling pleasure), and there's no shortage of little quirks that definitely give the place character (i.e. their refusal to serve any diet sodas).The food kinda sucks, though. I'll admit I liked the huge and considerately chilled Coke bottle, but that's about it. The fries were quite...flaccid and stale, the burger didn't seem so fresh or special, and it was relatively pricey for the amount of sustenance you get. Even so, you don't need more than a single bypass burger, unless you're itching to be useless for the next few hours, or if you are a gorilla. Yet the clever presentation of what might sound like a practical joke with poor taste makes this place worth visiting with some friends. You'll have fun, and you'll be plenty full by the end of it!~~#~0
I have only had their pizza once, to go. It was ok but nothing to write home about.;... would try again but will be more skepitcal....~~#~0
Amazing!, I crave see on a daily basis! They are absolutely delicious, it's weird, they are like cupcakes from heaven! Sure 3.50 is a little pricey, but they truly are the best cupcakes I've ever had. Everyone there is always so nice and friendly, my only complaint is I wish they had one closer to my house! Get the red velvet...you won't be sorry. The lemon, cinnamon sugar, and peanut butter chocolate chip are also very good. Yum!!~~#~1
I cannot say enough about how much I LOVE We Care Family Wellness Center! I refer everyone I know to them. Dr. Ross, Cheryl, and everyone on staff are truly wonderful. They genuinely care about you as a person and always make you feel like you are the only patient on the planet whenever they are with you. They are never rushed and will take all the time in the world to listen to you and figure out what's going on with you. After having seen more doctors than I care to remember, I feel so blessed that I have found such amazing healthcare providers!~~#~1
I have been going to Elite Nails for two years and they have always been wonderful!  People see my nails and always ask where I go.  I highly recommend.~~#~1
I had such a great experience with Love Carpet Care and Repair. They were friendly and courteous and enthusiastic every time I spoke to them on the phone, and their work was incredible.  I hired them to clean a carpet in an apartment.  The leasing office at the apt complex told me the carpet was in such bad shape they would have to trash it.  (Quick aside: I did not live in the apartment, but I was responsible for the damage...)  Love Carpet Care did such a good job cleaning the carpet it looked nearly new again.  Truly outstanding.  And, most importantly, the price they quoted me beforehand - when I gave them an honest account of the condition and size - was the final price.  Love it!  And it was cheap.  I was desperate and upset enough that they really could have charged me anything, but they were wonderful.  Honest, hardworking, helpful.I could never say enough good things about this company.~~#~1
Stacy's is so cute! I pulled up and its a little shack with some limited seating outside. Seems like most people take their food to go, but your more then welcome to eat at their tables if you like.When you pull up, you order at the window and they make the food for you while you wait.  There were a few of us hanging out in the parking lot at the time, which was kinda fun!  I got the BBQ Brisket to go, and it was a okay.  I loved the fact that it was smoked, and the BBQ sauce was on the side, so I could put on as much as I'd like.Menu's kinda limited but good, and pricing is fair.  So, I was checking out their make shift dining area, and I had to laugh because there was a spray painted sign above that said "man cave."  LOL.Place is cute, I recommend carrying out, and parking is kinda tight. Definitely a cute spot, and not a half bad place!~~#~0
Great to see a Total Wine closer to where I live.  Large selection and decent prices. Used the $10 off coupon from the newspaper to buy a nice Napa Cab this afternoon.~~#~0
Let me start off by saying that there are several Slices restaurants in the Valley. The one on Mill is by far the best. They have the most amazing and original selection of pizza.  No matter what you pick, it will be good.  If your favorite isn't available when you walk in, no problem! They will make it for you! If you are looking for a slice of heaven, you MUST try the salad pizza.  No, its not lettuce on crust!  It is simply the most unbelievable creation that includes artichokes, red pepper, and spinach.  It is great by itself, but ask for them to put balsamic dressing on top.  The balsamic takes it from being amazing to last meal quality :-)~~#~1
Very authentic, excellent Thai food and soothing ambience. And they have delivery! My favorites are the Fried Shrimp Rolls, Egg Rolls, Clear Noodle Soup, Pad Thai Chicken, Phad-See-Ew Beef, Papaya Salad, etc.. I love the Sweet Rice with Thai Custard. It tastes exactly like the Filipino custard I grew up with.~~#~1
This place wasn't quite up to scratch for me. I had the foie gras sandwich.  It was pretty good, but I was still ravenous $10 later, so I top it off with a chocolate croissant ($2.75) which was also good.  Definitely a cute space with above average dishes.  But in the end there just wasn't enough bangs for my bucks.~~#~0
Delicious sandwiches!! its so worth the drive i just wish it was closer to home so we could eat there more. My hubby brought me a sandwich home a couple weeks ago and it wasn't the same, it was too soggy so id prefer to eat there. The regular ham with added bacon is the best!!~~#~1
I just purchased a new Sorento here and my experience was amazing. Mike Bergesson was super easy to work with and got me a great deal. I live 50 miles away and there are 4 closer Kia dealerships, but I would do business with Salazar Kia over the others any day. Thanks!~~#~1
well everyone there is pretty nice i got gel tips from them and i do beat them up pretty bad at work and they are holding up as they should. they were reasonably priced. There is one Asian lady i like a lot i forgot her name though my fault. I also got a pedicure from them as well they did good.PROS:* inexpensive * good color selection* nice people*television availableCONS:*Some of my tips are longer than others*When i got a pedicure the water was so hot it burned me feet and they came out of the water looking like cherry tomatoes*whenever i seem to give them the tip off my visa they seem almost disappointed since its not cash (i dont carry cash and im not starting anytime soon)*the language barrier but its no one's fault*the massaging pedi chairs are made for people taller than me *sigh*Since the cons outweigh the pros it gets 3 stars but you are still getting really good service considering how much you pay for it and i will continue to give them my business because the lady who gave me the pedicure was really nice and she did a really good job getting rid of my callouses and didnt torture me too bad (im extremely ticklish).~~#~0
Their alcohol slushies are undrinkable and are sure case of gut rot. As far as the place, its pretty small you'll probably want to leave after 10 minutes.~~#~1
I have been coming to this place for atleast 5 years. This is a favorite of my friend's whole family. This place is so very consistent. They always have the same good things. If you're looking for buffet variety this is not the place. Everyone is so very nice. This place has been open for 30 years for good reason. I have never ordered from their menu because their buffet is so good. Go and try not to get hooked. Enjoy!~~#~1
i stopped by here on a lunch break because the sign said appraisals by appointment. the owner (?) indra was there and willing to do the appraisal on my engagement ring while i waited (without an appointment ... yay!). he cleaned my ring at no charge, inspected it and provided the retail value at no charge. indra told me a written appraisal for insurance purposes is only $45 ... a bargain compared to what others in the valley are charging. the stock of jewelry was lovely ... a nice mix of new and used pieces. some very unique, one of a kind finds as well. i found a few things i would prefer not to live without! they do all their own importing, and buy, sell and trade jewelry. i felt he was very honest about my ring, the cash value he stated was in line with numbers i heard from other jewelers and he was charming and helpful, answering questions and educating me while i ogled over diamonds and pearls. i will return to have my watch batteries replaced, a pair of earrings changed from yellow to white gold, and pretty much anything else i can think of. i trusted him immediately, which, when dealing with diamonds, is of paramount importance to me.~~#~1
Heaven. Fuego is just heaven. This super small, yet charming place is our favorite!! The menu is unique, and delish!! The creamed corn is to die for, I am talking unbelievable!! Thirsty? Their mojito selection is insane and they have an even better happy hour. Only negative is, that because of its small size, it fills up fast. reservations are a must!~~#~1
whole foods whole paycheck wholly sh$t i am sorry there prices are rediculous the only reason i went there is because since moving here from a very foody town certain products are nearly impossible to find and they do have them but you will pay, my search today was mushroms not button but chantrel/oyster/ect i was going to get every thing on my list but when i saw shallots at 4.95 a lb i bought my shrooms and split the i hit frys, shallots 2.49 a lb and of course theres always trader joes~~#~1
I have been going to Mesha's Salon and Spa for the past 5 years and absolutley love it. I see Michelle (the owner) and she comes up with some great new looks for me. I have gone from short hair, funky styles and colors and long and sexy hair. She is awesome and I love her recommendations. There have been times I have gone in and not knowing what to do... and she always comes up with something that makes me feel fabulous !!I will never go anywhere else.~~#~1
This was really 3.5 stars and I'm rounding down to 3 for a few reasons...on which I will now elaborate.District could be in any Sheraton, anywhere.  In fact, it is strikingly similar to Rum Fire, the trendy restaurant in the Sheraton Waikiki where I stayed for a few days this summer before my family arrived and we stayed moved to the family place.  The flooring, the red circular lounge area, the live music on Thursday nights...it was all the same.  Heck, even the menu was the same.  The difference was that in Waikiki there was a "Hawaiian" slant to everything and the live music was much, much better.  (And of course the beach front setting).  I get the impression that they are trying to market themselves as a "downtown restaurant" more than the "place in the Sheraton"...but to be honest, it is your quintessential trendy hotel restaurant.The bartenders were really friendly.  The wine list for a "wine bar" is incredibly lacking.  Nothing interesting, nothing fun.  The pricing is on par with what I would expect from a hotel.  The space is modern and trendy, something that there isn't that much of in downtown.  I love the charm of a historic home, but I also love sleek and modern lines.We selected a few small plates, or appetizers, depending on which of their menus you are looking at.  The crab cakes were good, if nothing short of predictable, and the chips and dip were surprisingly unique.  A dill dip and a French onion dip provided a nice departure from the regular spinach artichoke.  I'm not sure this is a place that I would come to for dinner, and it is definitely not a place I would come to for brunch.  (The brunch menu is a typical hotel menu, with typical hotel pricing).  I think that for me District will just remain a place for drinks and small bites.  I'm not going to lose my mind over this place.  It's not that great, I'd say it's fairly generic.  But the staff was friendly and it's within walking distance of my place.  I'm sure I will be back for drinks.~~#~0
Went there with my date on Thursday night; it was quite empty.I don't think the decoration is as nice as it said in other reviews; it's about alright.The issue I found is waiter walks pass in front of you during the movie. The color of the screen is yellowish that makes movie look old. It's more like watching a DVD at home. When watching movies, I don't like to be interrupted, so the waiter service during the movie really bothers me. The good thing is it's very close to my house, I can go there on foot.~~#~0
had a great time here the other day!  the food was delicious and the staff was just as wonderful.i can't wait to come back here and try out more of their dishes!~~#~1
I do not understand less than four stars. We had six different plates. Beet Salad, Rabit, Butter,Scallops,Strawberry desert, and Peach desert.  All were brilliant. Our favorite (both agreed) was the Beet Salad. It was so fresh and had a perfect combo of flavors and textures. Service was way more than perfect. One note they are now BYOB with a corkage fee for Beer and Wine. No fee if the Beer or Wine is from Arizona.One note for FnB we were preplexed with the lack of pork on the menu :-)~~#~1
Good micro brew made right there. Food is good as well.~~#~1
If they werent located around the corner, I would never use this store.  I have taken back produce MULTIPLE times due to expiration so watch the dates when buying!!~~#~0
Well it was off to Brio last night for "date" night!!!  The last time we were at Brio was in September to celebrate our 16th Anniversary...yes consecutive years, and it was a great evening!  Last night, no so much.  In all the years we've been going to Brio, we have NEVER had such HORRIBLE service....ever!The food was as amazing as it always is, but the terrible service completely overshadowed the tasty treats from the kitchen.  Our server stood and waited for us to finish sitting and before we could even open our napkins was asking for our drink order, not a good sign of things to come.  So I opted for water to come while we contemplated our cocktails.  So the water came, then nothing....nothing....no one....nada.  After about 10 minutes the server returned for our cocktail order.  The longest 10 minutes in history I'll admit.  So off to get the drinks....15 minutes later they arrived with the bread for the table...now mind you we'd been sitting alone at the table with no attention for 25 minutes now.  That is a lifetime for a restaurant that makes their money by turning tables.  When the drinks and bread arrived we opted to put in our dinner order, thinking we'd be in for a long bumpy night.  So we ordered, I ordered the Campanelle Carbonara, but with the Spicy Pepper Sauce from the Spicy Shrimp and Eggplant Appetizer, as opposed to the traditional sauce.  The server said no problem, you want the Angel Hair Pasta with the Spicy Sauce, do you want to add Shrimp or Chicken???  Well the Campanelle Carbonara comes with Chicken, Spinach, Bacon, and Parmesan Cheese.  So I explained it is NOT Angel hair Pasta as the Campanelle is a 'trumpet' shaped pasta with curled edges.  He said "Oh you want the Lasagna Noodles".....!  Of course I just said ask the chef to prepare the entree as he usually would, BUT, substitute the sauces.  Glenn ordered the same, but with the traditional sauce.  We both opted for the wedge salad, and asked that our entrees not be fired until we were completed with our salad.  After all, we all know all the ingredients are pre-made, and just needed to be assembled and heated..  Whew...I felt...that was exhausting!  Then the salads arrived.  Ice cold, yummy...!  Now we are back on track.  Boy that salad does hit all the notes that take you back to your childhood.  Nothing is better than Ice Cold Iceberg Lettuce w/blue cheese dressing, bacon crumbles, and fresh shaved Parmesan cheese!!!  Then it happened.....yes just as we thought, in order to speed up the process that started so slowly............our entrees arrive BEFORE we were even 1/2 way through our salads.  So there they sit...all beautiful, completed just as ordered...and no Lasagna Noodles, no Angel Hair Pasta...just the wonderfulness awaiting our forks.  But...yes...But, we'd not finished our salads.  By the time we did, our pasta was sad, cold, and looked like it had let us down.  It didn't, OUR SERVER DID....oh by the way were we EVER asked if we wanted anything else to drink???  You guessed it NO....were we EVER asked how our dinner was???  You guessed it NO... Now you're probably saying, 'why didn't you do something about it'?  We'd have loved to, but there was no one around...not even someone to fill our water glasses.  Only after we were finished with our sad, cold, entrees and had stacked all the dirty dishes in a pile on the edge of the table, did our server make an appearance to ask how our dinner is going??? Are you kidding me???  We just asked for the check.  Upon his return we presented him with the discount that Brio had sent us for being frequent diners, he took that and never returned.  After sitting there at an empty table, empty water glasses and nothing to look at but the crumbs left behind from the wonderful flat bread.  We placed cash on the table and left to try to reclaim our evening.  On the way out, Glenn finally spotted a manager and explained our evening and that it would be a VERY LONG time before we tried Brio again.  He, the manager, just stumbled over his words and said he wished he's known about our evening so he could have done something about it.  Well maybe if he'd been circulating on the floor as opposed to hanging out with the ever so cute hostess' he'd have known.  Do we still like Brio...YES...are we extremely disappointed with our service last night...YES.....~~#~0
So i thought with all the controversy surrounding this place, I would support the first amendment with my wallet. Unfortunately our experience here was subpar to say the least. We came in on a 3pm on Saturday and there was only one other couple inside. We were literally outnumbered by the people working there. I say this because somehow, despite this fact, the service was HORRENDOUS. I mean we got our order out fine, but our waitress dissappeared after that. At one point I had to almost get refills for us myself. The sushi itself was so overpriced for what it was. The Philadelphia roll was decent, but the California roll was really bad. When it came to paying, I put my credit card in the sleeve and waited for awhile. Despite there being no one else in the restaurant at this point except one other table, the waitress didn't return. If it wasn't for the cash I had on me I'd be waisting away there at this moment because she had no intention of returning and I have no intention of ingesting there food ever again!~~#~1
This tiny sushi joint is in a prime location.  That's the real draw.The sushi is just okay (and you can get the same sushi at Geisha-a-go-go which is more fun).  The hamachi kama is just okay.  The steak is just okay.  Overall, this place is average.I wish I had better things to say about it, but the service was not great (it was not bad, just average) and the bill was high considering the quality of everything we ordered.Would I come here again?  Nah.~~#~0
Let me start off by saying that if there were 6 stars, I'd give this place 6 stars!"Last Chance" is simply amazing, but only to those true bargain shopaholics. There are days when the store will be flourishing with dreamlike items fluttering all over the place, waiting to be picked up and finding a new home in your closet. Other times, you must dig deep, and then come out with a diamond in the rut.I visited "Last Chance" today and fell in love all over again. I got a BCBG dress, three name brand tees, two casual dresses, eight hair bands, a adorable pair of earrings, FIVE purses and a pair of lace leggings for $39.00. And they all still had the Nordstrom tag on it!!!!They had so many things on sale (in addition to their already low prices). To truely love "Last Chance", you must have an open mind and realize that this is not your typical department store, therefore it will not operate like one, so get over the kids, crowds and messes, it's Nordstrom stuff at below yardsale prices!! You must also be fashion and brand savvy."Uhh.. Darn diggity goodness mother of Betunia McGrittles, these scary looking boots with a devil pointy edge are $29.99, and they look like they have been tried on oh fooey pooey, that is just too garsh darn expensive Gurtude, And someone wrote their name, "Jimmy Choo" on it. Uhh, why are there so many  people ALL over the place, and grabbing shoes like crazy making a mess.. Oh goodness heaven no, this store is horrible.. Just like that "Juicy Couture" jumpsuit for $9.99 a piece up front, oh no another child making a mess, let's get out of here and go to Sears or JC Penny, they have such great elastic pants grandma jeans and they never have a mess there! I do not see why people like this place darn diggity.." -Random "Last Chance" non-enthusiast.Key point, if you're not into brands and fashion, and are not creative and a bargain shopper lover, then you will not appreciate this beautiful place we are so lucky to have in Phoenix!! :)"Last Chance" tips..(All "Last Chancers" will put a  hit on me after this, but I love my fellow yelpers oh so much lol)*Arrive EARLY. Anytime after noon all the goods will most likey be gone and all the damaged/ugly stuff will be left. *WATCH YOUR CART! People will take you 25.00 pair of Coach wedges lol*Don't make eye contact with anyone! Don't trust anyone! If you see a pair of Seven jeans for 14.99 DESCRETELY grab them and move on.. Any sense of alert will beckon a herd of jean hungry woman and you will get mobbed!*Move QUICKLY, if you have to RUN! Especially if you are there right when they open, set your mind to what you want and RUN to that department. This will assure first dibs on the that section's finest.*Don't start crap with ANYONE! It can get really ugly.. and there is a wall of pictures of "banned" people from "Last Chance" and that is no where you want to end up in for ANYONE!The rest of the tips are too super insider to say aloud, sorry huns! but I will spill one super "Last Chancer" tip..Happy shopping! muaaah :)*Look in the size 10-11 in woman shoes, that's where all the BEST shoes are "hidden"  or "stashed" by other people who will be back later that day or had to go to the bathroom upstairs and didn't have anyone to hold their shoes. No woman really wears those sizes so they figure to just stash them there for a few minutes.. I cannot begin to describe the designer glories I have discovered stuffed behind a size 11 pair of Pumas..NOTE TO EVERYONE: OVERALL, PLEASE BE NICE AND SHARE. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT GO THERE JUST TO FIND DEALS AND RESELL THEM ON EBAY AND THEY CAN BE JUST PLAIN MEAN. REMEMBER, WE ARE ALL HUMAN AND MUST BE KIND TO ONE ANOTHER, NO CURSING, SHOVING, ECT. LET'S MAKE LAST CHANCE A NICE PLACE TO SHOP, AND END THE VIOLENCE AND ANGER OVER CLOTHES/PURSES/SHOES ECT. WE CANNOT SELL OUR SOULS TO THEM. TAKE CARE EVERYONE :)~~#~1
Great food can be found anywhere. Great service is one in a million these days. This place gets an A+ in the most awful service I have ever received and if you have/had a Groupon for this place like I did, don't even bother going. You'll be treated worse than a bothersome fly on a hot and humid day.It's simple. Businesses put  their name out by working with daily coupon sites like Groupon, LivingSocial, etc., to garner new and potential repeat customers. Instead, after going there with my handy coupon, I can't help but drive by this place on the way home and think nothing but the horrible experience I received. I went with my boyfriend and bought the Groupon because I was impressed due to online reviews and decided to splurge on a good ole' prime rib. We sit down, am impressed with the old school decor, and then the server from Azkaban appears. We tell her that we'd like to order off the special evening menu where it's a little cheaper and tell her joyfully that we found this place through Groupon and that it's our first time. Wrong thing to do. I don't know if it's because past Groupon-ers don't tip well or something, but I could swear her smile immediately turned 180 degrees in an instant. It took our food (the chicken and prime rib) almost 33 minutes to come out. All we did was nom ... and nom ... and nom on the watery coleslaw and gritty liver (which isn't to blame since I was never a liver fan). Not once did our server come by our table. We watched her run into the kitchen and either not come back out for a while or attend to other tables. It was another server that came out and gave us our food so we let our frustration go since it wasn't her fault and there's no use in calling her out for nothing. We asked if she knew where our server was, and she said she would look for her. 10 minutes later, nothing, yet it was the new server who kept coming back, asking if everything was alright like a normal server should. Then it was time for the check and we just wanted to get out of there since we were basically ignored. 17 minutes pass, no check came even though our  table had been cleared. Our server was still MIA so we asked a random server to give us our check. He said he would tell our server to bring it back and we told him straight up that we didn't even want to see her face so another random server brought it back.We had a table of 4 sitting next to us who even leaned over and asked us why we were being so calm when our non-existent server was treating us like crap. We didn't even want to bother waiting another 20 minutes just to talk to a manager since apparently the only way the servers here communicate is by playing Telephone so we just left after paying. The table beside us told us that they were going to complain for us since we wanted to leave, but whether they did or not I didn't even care at that point. To be honest, I can't even remember what the food tasted like, which isn't quite fair in a review. I went here a couple of months ago, but I have never had an experience where service overrode the taste of food. I'm pretty sure prisoners in a cafeteria get more attention than I did.Maybe it wasn't even the Groupon. Who knows. All I know is that we ran out of there like Usain Bolt and tell anyone who asks about our worst dining experience that this is the place to experience it.~~#~1
I've been really impressed with John Skiba and his professionalism. He is always up to date on everything in bankruptcy law and I've enjoyed reading his blog posts. It really shows his expertise and passion for what he does. Hopefully I will never need his services but if I ever were to need an Arizona bankruptcy attorney I would go to him first for sure.~~#~1
My fiance and I tried the place because of a Groupon.  We live in the same neighborhood and see the place all the time but the look of the place was never enough to draw us in.  There is nothing eye catching about the business front at all.  It's in a strip mall and looks old.  At night, they turn on strands of tacky Christmas lights that only attract attention to the fact that the lights are so poorly hung.When we arrived for dinner we were greeted by an empty corridor, no host station and no host.  We could see what looked to be a bar but it wasn't a bar that I'd want to eat, drink and socialize at.  To pass the time until we were finally greeted we browsed the many framed publications touting how incredible the place was.  I'm already here...I don't need any more persuasion.  It's time for the Chef/owner to take down the "look how good I was" trophy wall and go with a more inviting modern look.We were greeted by friendly gentleman who seated us on the main lower floor.  He handed us our menus and asked if he could get us something to drink.  There is no drink menu on the menu.  No beer list, no soda list, no liquid period.  We asked to see the wine list, which had only bottle prices and doesn't even hint that they sell wine by the glass.  Once I asked if they had beer and sold wine by the glass it was like we made a breakthrough.   The menu seems a bit outdated so I  went with the Lasagna, the basics.  While we sat waiting for our meal, the salads came.  Weird...the menu didn't mention anything about a salad nor did the waiter.   More lack of information from the menu.Now on to the decor.  It is terribly outdated.  Tacky, bland, pale paint scheme, brass fixtures, mirrors and cliche wine bottles.  There were beautiful fresh flowers throughout which we really enjoyed.  I was unfortunately seated directly in front of two paintings both with a woman and a little girl drinking what appears to be wine.  I'm guessing they are personal family paintings but they are horribly out of place and bordering on creepy.  I couldn't take my eyes off of them and that distracted me throughout the night.  This place needs a makeover, new modern paint scheme and some updating on the artwork.The lasagna came.  It was OK at best.  I tried my fiance's chicken genevese at it was horrible.  The chicken tasted like it was boiled which is an instant dish killer for me.  We did not take our leftovers.  We asked for the check and it came with a after dinner cordial which was a nice surprise and tasted delicious. We won't be back.  To be honest Oregano's lasagna is better by far.~~#~1
Total bait and switch sales department! Will tell you one price over the phone, then quote you another when you arrive! Happened to me personally 3 times. I bought from Scottsdale BMW. One quote, one price, done deal. Buyer beware...~~#~1
Very good food but a little overpriced for the amount of food you get so the price is the only reason I am giving it a 3 star instead of a 4 star.  Cost about $11.50 for a small sandwich side salad and an ice tea.  All the food seems to be of the organic nature so definitely taste is higher quality.I have been there 3 times and each time left still hungry; however, did feel that I had a healthier lunch than other options in the area.If you are in the mood for a high quality / healthy light lunch and okay with paying $10-12 per person definitely give Essence Bakery a shot.~~#~0
I dined here last week with my wife and in-laws and, I gotta say, it doesn't get much better.  Ambiance was dark but classy.  Loved the music (no dated Rat Pack stuff here).  Started the evening with their amazing Trio of Duck Fat Fries.  The truffle emulsion may have been the best sauce I've ever had in my life!  Only got better from there: Shellfish tower was loaded with goodies and all tasted straight from the ocean!  For entrees, my wife got the Trio of Kobe Beef and I had the Fried Chicken for two.  One of the top meals I've ever had in my life.  The chicken was so moist an came with a truffle mac & cheese and onion jus.  I did say it was for two but it was so good that i refused to share.  My wife couldn't stop talking about the Kobe Trio.  But, I gotta say, the best part of the experience was the staff.  Knowledgeable just isn't enough to describe the service here.  They care about every single detail, never missing one.  The Sommelier made excellent wine recommendations (and each one well within my price range) and never skipped a beat when it came to pouring for the table.  The server was as professional as professional gets and the Manager seemed to always be there to pull out a chair or provide a fresh napkin.  Flawless.Well done Bourbon Steak!~~#~1
Love love love this place! Seriously, a place in Phoenix that is locally owned, has great prices, great food and buys local is pretty hard to find. My favorite wrap is the Gardin'n salad as a wrap. My only complaints about this place are the hours and the parking! But still well worth it.~~#~1
I rarely give 5 stars, as I believe it is very difficult to obtain a perfect score through food, beverage, service, ambiance, etc. Christopher's new venture is perfectly Christopher, 5 stars.First off a little background, Christopher is a native. That's right; he's a graduate of Central High School. He studied in France where he honed his craft and to this day draws his technique from. He has owned now three ventures in Phoenix, first his fine dining and bistro location on the northwest corner of 24st and Camelback (later became Eddie's by Eddie Matney, former hair dresser turned chef at Cous-Cous then Eddie's Grill) then after closing he moved to the restaurant row in The Biltmore Fashion Park, 2rd level to open Christopher's Fermier Brasserie & Paola's Wine Bar. Which in reading many reviews here on Yelp was unfortunately misunderstood. It makes me wonder if people understand what French is, it's not their fault though, there aren't many French restaurants in town, most have be closed, including Mary Elaine's at the Phoenician  and John Claude's Petite Cafe. There are a few that still survive Sophie's and Vincent's, but in this town of chains few people venture for French. Now with Christopher's Restaurant/Crush Lounge he has passed on the wine bar and opened a lounge instead. Christopher does enjoy lounges as he is a regular at Merc Bar, but then so is his smoked salmon which is offered on the Merc Bar menu. So a lounge makes sense, I'm a believer in a chef should open what they are passionate about. The new location has a different feel from his previous; his last venture echoed a French Countryside feel, as did the food. I think that was why many didn't understand it; yes it was French, but ALL FRENCH IS NOT FINE DINNING. I wish more understood that concept, but this is primarily a beer drinking state, not wine or rather more Mc D's not Mary E's! Hence there's a difference between filling your stomach and filling your soul and leaving a restaurant inspired with the feeling that life is wonderful. Christopher's is the latter. The design is contemporary with long lines of brushed stainless, white linen and exposed wooden beams. Kudos to whoever designed it, great job! The tables are dressed with white linen, elegant silver and polished stemware. You can't help but feel that it's 'time to dine' when seated. The walls in the main dining room have many vases of fresh flowers that seem to be replaced whenever necessary, nice touch.  The food at Christopher's is exactly what you'd expect, French, without the super-high-end prices. He's still one of the only chefs in town serving Foie Grass and Duck Confite, both wonderful and worth the trip if a glass of juice (wine) is added! I've been there now on 4 occasions and everything is fantastic, flavorful and prepared professionally. Christopher offers daily specials and I recommend them including; Veal Chop on Wednesdays, Roasted Duck on Thursday, Lamb Shank on Friday and Rabbit on Saturday. But don't stop at your entree, get the cheese course for dessert or for something sweet, the Chocolate Tower is one of the best desserts in town, hands down, no question.  Service is another point were Christopher sets himself apart. It doesn't get any better than this. Again it's NOT fine dining, so you can't compare it to fine dining restaurants (but then again there's only one left in the valley - Different Point Of View).  The servers know the food; they can describe anything on the menu and recite the specials as if their job depends on it (if you know Christopher it probably is).  Food is coursed correctly with a few minutes in between, as well as wine service is as professional as it gets. The bread service is as always, French breads with a super rich, euro butter, perfect for lapping up to sauce or vinaigrette remains on your plate.Needless to say, Christopher does it right, in my opinion, or is it just my opinion? Many of the valley's most celebrated chefs eat at Christopher's, he's know in many circles as the "chef's chef". But don't take my word for it, ask the chef at your favorite restaurant, who their favorite chefs are in town, and favorite restaurants, most likely Christopher will make the list!Here's the web address:  http://www.christophersaz.com/The website is limited; menu, wine list, press release and pictures of the restaurant...~~#~1
Hands down, best slices in Scottsdale....~~#~1
Just don't.~~#~1
My wife and I ate here last night and were extremly happy. We started with drinks at the bar, which started the night out perfectlly, then we had an appetizaer, which was a tower of cheese ( a sculpture of grilled cheese, like the hard grilled cheese on the sides of a grilled cheese sandwich). I had the tacos, they may be small, but they were packed by taste. My wife had the fish of the day, and that day it was halibut, my wife said it was the best fish she ever had. The service was great, overall a great smalll place to eat.~~#~1
Pricey!!  Not my fave place to shop for vintage wares but decent to peak through.~~#~0
Culver's is a must if you have not had the chance to try them out. I believe they have several stores now here in the valley. The Root Beer is a must as well as the Butter Burgers, Cheese curds, Frys, Frozen custurd....lol ...the list goes on... I have not found anything as of yet that I did not enjoy.~~#~1
Even though I am officially in my 30s, I look like I'm still in college, which made me feel slightly less uncomfortable when I walked into The Clubhouse. Yes, it is near ASU, and yes, it is an all-age venue, so I should have expected that the club would be filled with 18-20 somethings. But just because I look 21, doesn't mean that my internal reality made me feel a little out-of-place. But, I was like, whateva!It is somewhat of a dive bar trying to be a club but failing miserably. Like a nerd trying to be punk or a cheerleader trying to be emo -- it somehow didn't work for me. It felt like I was in someone's basement turned rocker's haven. Black walls, haphazard decor, and one sole stinky quasi-couch that looked like it had been salvaged from some dump. The stage was at the front of the club, and the bar in the middle dissected the under-21 crowd from the over-21 boozers. Unfortunately, if you wanted to drink, you had to stay on the over-21 side of the bar. That sucked because you barely had a view of the stage. WTF?!  Shouldn't the paying lushes get a better view than the youngsters who only paid to get in the club? Stupid. I have to say, though, the sound system was a helluva lot better than some of the other small music venues I've been to.  That's a plus.  Finally, this last annoyance will definitely show my age, but having to stand the entire time I was there was horrible. My feet hurt, dammit! And, I just wanted to sit down! But, I'll suck it up the next time because there are some great bands that play here, and for me, great music can make any situation better.~~#~0
The scenery was amazing!! Wooooooooo!! - Well thats my biggest impression of this place. If you're looking for a great place to golf, i suggest you swing by this place. They give you 5 stars customer service and making sure that you're having the best time of your life.~~#~1
AAAAMAZING.They have the best hot dogs and corn dogs i have ever had.  It is definitely a place to try if you love hot dogs.They have good fries, excellent onion rings.... and very very reasonable prices!  I have never met a single person who has said anything but incredible things about Ted's..... definitely a must try!~~#~1
WOW!  From service to food, 5 stars!    Went here last night for our 10th anniversary.   They never cease to amaze us.   Husband had a Caesar salad, Rib Eye with crab legs and I had a salad with Balsamic Vinagrette,  Salmon with Asian glaze with a carrott and swiss chard medley.  Amazing!!   Perfection.  Kyle served us, we were impressed by his knowledge of the menu and attention to detail.    Everyone we came in contact with was pleasant.  If only more restaurants treated their patrons this way!  If you have their VIP card you also earn 'points' which convert into $ you can use towards a future visit.    Thanks Kyle and McCormick and Schmicks!!~~#~1
Just as good a Pizzeria Bianco! But with the added bonus of not having to wait for hours and hours. Granted there may still be a wait here but you aren't fighting tourist for tables at this joint. It's more of a local fav! Fresh gourmet toppings and very good crust! Personally a big fan of the garden seating! There was a longer than normal wait for the food however, the server was very attentive and I thoroughly enjoyed the ambiance as we had drinks in garden. I would not recommend this place for a quick meal but it's perfect if you bring friends and want to have time to relax and enjoy conversation!~~#~1
The BF and I went here this morning for breakfast after finding it on yelp. I thought it sounded good and I love trying new places, so we went. The place was busy, we almost left because there were no parking spaces left... luckily we made one more pass and someone was just walking to his car to leave. There was a little bit of a wait, but not bad. So the inside of this place is really cute, with the wood paneling and all. We got a cute little booth. We both ordered coffee, which was very meh. Really watered down coffee and cost 2.25 a cup. For breakfast, I ordered the spanish omelet and the BF got biscuits and gravy. The omelet was really good. It had a kind of spicy sauce on it that was tasty and I added cheddar which really went well with the sauce. The potatoes that it came with were nothing special, no real flavor. It also came with toast which was what it was. That cost 9$. The BF liked his B&G but thought it was a bit salty. It cost around 8$ with bacon. Overall, I'd say the place was good, but not great. For the 27$ I spent after tip, I could have gone to Liberty Market which is much much better, so I probably wouldn't come back here.~~#~0
Try the Larb, it is on happy hour and it even comes in tofu as a veggie option. This one dish alone ($5) at happy hour would make me love this place but there were many more delights that made my visit so great.I don't drink with dinner but here it was happy hour all day sat, and they had a unique drink the Curry Gimlet, IT comes in a martini glass has a orange hue, it is fruity but has a curry finish from cardamom I assume, truly unique.Our dishes of Pad See ewe and Dragon noodles were great, and huge portions.   Rich flavors, well textured tofu and crisp veggies. When I made my reservation I let them know about the birthday of the person I was with. We were surprised with fried banana and ice cream along with a candle and signing it was great!~~#~1
Um. YAY!  Picture a girl hanging with her lovely on a Monday afternoon after what could be politely described as a terrible week before, looking to soothe her spirit with some lovely food and atmosphere [the company was already delightful...]. I saw a piece in the local rag about C4 and since we're already in Moon Valley I say 'how 'bout it'. Jeff agrees and we're off - We arrived just before 4 - closing time and the bartender/waitperson was reeeeally nice. She told us we had only a few minutes to order because the kitchen would be closing and that the pizza oven was already off. No worries, we remain unfazed. We sat at a high top next to the bar, there were a few other people at tables nearby, some drinking coffee and one couple enjoying the bruschetta and some wine on a leather sofa by the large fireplace. The room hits just the right notes for me, warm and inviting, nice art but not overpowering - its a place I could hang out in. We both had a nice glass [generous pour] of a Voga Pinot Gris and a sandwich. I had smoked salmon, Jeff had roast beef. The smoked salmon was a generous portion with capers, cuke and tomato and a what seemed to be a seasoned mayo [not goat cheese as the online menu suggests but a nice and savory compliment just the same] on a toasted baguette. Roast beef was similar in scale, lots of meat with melted cheddar, greens also on a toasted baguette. Each was served with a side of chips and a pickle. It may have been me or just the mood I was in but I really felt relaxed there and in spite of the fact that we closed the place for the afternoon, we didn't feel rushed or in the way. It was just a nice, shoulder dropping, ahhhh experience. Not the spa, but just what the doctor ordered. Serious yay, total digdom. We wanted to plant a place just like it of our own on the beach in Maui...its nice to dream...Totally worth the trip; we will be back~~#~1
Best and most helpful hardware store I have visited. Thank God I live almost across the street!After many, many home projects and recently rebuilding my kitchen, I have frequented this Ace almost more times than I should. But I am always pleased at how quickly and smoothly my searches at this Ace are.Try it, you'll like it!~~#~1
Not a bad sub which I find to be something I can eat almost daily.  Prices are a little higher than a Subway but their meat is freshly sliced to order and they do a much better job with their bread.  They are still lacking the hard crust french/Italian bread that I crave since leaving the East Coast but this is something I have learned not to expect out here in AZ.  The girls that work behind the counter are excellent and a few have been there for years.  They know service and are fast and great at keeping the lines at bay.~~#~0
What ever you do don't waste your money here.  I am not the person who likes to send food back, in fact I hate to do it.  I had no choice here, this was by far the worst mexican food I have eaten.  The food has such a horrible after taste.  I not only hated my meal but tried my boyfriends as well and it was still terrible.  The service compares to the food, we waited forvever just for a server to come over and greet us.  I wouldn't even recommend this place to my enemies.~~#~1
Fat fries are good, but that's probably it. I had a turkey burger that didn't taste much better than something I could make in my microwave. I had "everything" but still could barely taste anything. 3 stars is because my brother had an L and it was really L. His also looked much better than mine did. All in all, it is better than most fast food, but really isn't worth it for the price you pay. Your wallet would thank you for hopping across the street to In 'n' Out, and your tastebuds would thank you for driving several miles east to 5 guys.~~#~0
I've been to this location several times but I'd rather be more positive than nit-picky.  The service has always been a bit slow and less informative.  I've come in and on several occasions lost out on the specials till the very end when the server mentions "next time you should do the...." well I wish I would've known that earlier because I could've enjoyed more awesomeness!  Otherwise I love the atmosphere and the seating.  The space is really good, outdoor seating during this time of the year is jam and ambience are spot on for a group or a more datish type situation.  I've tried a few of the dishes and the food is pretty good but nothing yet that I've built up a craving for.  I'll be back soon for the Tuesday special of an app with a bottle of wine for $22 buckaroos!~~#~0
I woke up this morning craving a breakfast burrito. Fortunately just 3 days ago, a menu was left on our door for Cisco's Grill (with some great marketing I might add). Conveniently located right up the street from my house, I've been curious about this place since they opened! I strapped on my shoes and walked on over... upon entering I was greeted cordially and placed my order for a chorizo and egg burrito with cheese... The cook went to work and 5 minutes later I was holding a fresh hot burrito and a complimentary pineapple water! Cisco came out and introduced himself while I was waiting and chatted with me for a few minutes. Its clear to me that he's very passionate about his restaurant! The service is top notch!The menu itself is fairly generic, typical burger and fries, tacos and burritos, but everything is so fresh and prepared well! I'd recommend this joint to anyone looking for a quick, inexpensive bite to eat!~~#~1
I walked in and uttered, "I think I found my new home".1) Miller High Life on draught and bottle.2) Buckhunt (the lil orange gun has even been taped together-double buck bonus!)3) Bowling videogame...god, I love these things4) Indoor smoking lounge!!! With a large screen TV, two tables and a lot of pleather seating, the large fan won't mean much but WOW-exciting! There is a french style door separating the lounge from the bar area where the stage is so you can still peak at the band while sucking tar.5) Well...even the womens' bathroom is pretty gnarly...which would normally subtract a star-but I was so happy to pee in the unmarked restroom I won't touch it!Other notes: all bartender, barbacks, security were extremely sweet and friendly; all other patrons were either pretty chill, excited to see the band that was playing or willing to strike up conversation; tons of televisions everywhere; they had a lot of beers on tap-cheap too; this place is HUGE. In fact I would consider it a liability since there are a lot of steps connecting each section-at times I found myself balancing precariously-and that is b/c I am a klutz-wasn't even drunk...ok, not that drunk. Most everyone had tats, black hair, laid back. This is def. not a scene-and I love that!~~#~1
I stayed at the hotel and I tried Tuscany and it was really good.  Delicious Scallops and pasta.  Also the pizza was excellent.  The server was great and I would return to this restaurant when I visit the hotel again.~~#~1
For some reason or another this macy's has a better selection of shoes than the one at Scottsdale mall. In the past year I found a pair of Calvin Klein sandals for half off, and they carry the higher end, younger brands- which is great Nordstrom's selection tends to be for an older crowd.~~#~0
OK: call me 'weird' here: but; I liked the funky (very) Old School ambiance of MacAlpines when my fiance and I went there this past Sunday for the Studebaker and friends car show.Admittedly; I was there once before ca. 1999 and was NOT impressed but things have def improved IMHO.I had a Club sandwich and it was one of the best ones I've ever had, at least in recent years. Would eat one again. The chocolate milk shake was OK but could have used a tad more syrup but, I'd have one again.~~#~1
My husband and I have eaten Chinese food all over Phoenix, and hands down, Big Wa has been the best.  The BBQ pork with fresh spicy mustard is A-Mazing!!  We have ordered about 6 different dishes from here, sometimes totally blind and the food is always great!~~#~1
Brunch Review:DYNaMITE BLOODYMARYS. Something special.Expensive. Tasty. Friendly staff. GREAT tomato relish on the side. I like to go to brunch here on Sundays. I sit at the bar, and there is usually a sports game on, a good looking bartender pouring me coffee, and a guy with a hangover wearing sunglasses wishing he'd ordered the breakfast burrito sitting next me. Most of the dishes have some southwest/mexican food influencing the cuisine. The BIG 'ol Bistro Breakfast is delicious. I think it might be one egg too many, but the Cappicola and potatoes are delish.The Rojo Chili de La Casa is my go to, unless they have a special like Machaca Tostada's or Country Benedict (with sausage patties in place of Canadian Ham)They are really good about keeping the drinks topped off.~~#~0
One bite and I was transported back to the crowded streets of Monterrey.  I could almost smell the exhaust of the vochos and hear the distant conversation of the local policia extorting their prescribed mordida.  Quite simply, this is the taco as the way it was intended by its creators.  The pure and unadulterated classic enjoyed by the Mexican working class.What Pomo is to pizza, this place is to tacos.  Authentic...absolutely authentic.~~#~1
Joe's has long been one of our favorite restaurants in Gilbert.  The pulled pork is excellent, the sides are even better, and the service is always friendly.Don't be intimidated by a long line, even out the door, as it moves fast.  The cheesy potatoes and corn are great.  The lemon cake is very moist and a nice finish to a meal.Be sure to stop by on your birthday and pick up a free meal.The kids love running around outside in the grassy area, and always enjoy going to Joe's.~~#~1
The food and service was excellent!, however, several noisy undisciplined children running around in the restaurant and yelling loudly  made the dining experience less than pleasurable.  Apparently, these children were either members of the owners family or one of the employees.  Our requests to a server and another employee did little to rectify the situation.  I hope on our next visit, we will  have a more peaceful meal~~#~0
I'm sorry to say that they closed their doors for good just a few weeks ago!~~#~1
I hardly ever give five star reviews. My experience at Culinary Dropout today prompted me to do so. The reason we checked this place out was because I had a 25% coupon from Fox RC for Labor Day. First things first: The employees are extremely good looking. There is lots of tattoos and bare skin. Our bartender was awesome. He answered all our dumb questions with a smile and made some killer drinks. I had the Bacon Infused Bloody Mary and my friend had the Acai Mojito. I will be going back again to have that Bloody Mary. It was SO good. We started out with the homemade chips and onion dip and it was delicious. We pretty much filled up on those before we got our meals. I ordered the Havarti Burger, my roommate got the chef salad, and my other friend got the canneloni. Everything was super good, but it was too much food! My burger melted in my mouth and I kept stealing bites of my friend's salad. So, in a nutshell:- Great vibe.- Great food.- Great drinks.- Hot employees.- Clever menu titles/- Great experience!~~#~1
I love this place: look for the specials and the different events they always have going on. It's a great spot in the Valley.~~#~1
Loved the room and its functionality but this same room made me want to punch myself in the face.  I'm a young professional in his mid 30's who likes to party and understands what the W brand provides (especially on the weekends during moneymaker time) but when their DJ on Saturday night sounds like he's spinning from your bathroom, it makes for a tough stay.  Got home at 12:30 a little buzzed and had a rave in my head until 2am.  Finally got to sleep and loved the room and hotel otherwise, but this will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth. Maybe it's just a few rooms but 205 is a bad number here.~~#~0
Always great, fast and consistent!  The service is excellent, the staff has worked there for years and is speedy to run around and refill drinks and clear dishes.  It's nice to have the counter service so you don't have to wait to be waited on...because if I am at the mall I am there for serious business:)  If you like a home grown grilled cheese and some tomato soup or a salmon Cesar salad or even a gourmet pizza this is the place.  The brownie and the red velvet cake are hard to resist ...get both!~~#~1
I think Marcellino's will get a second chance for a special occasion.  I visited the restaurant based on seeing it on Check Please Arizona.  The food is obviously made fresh and was excellent but I felt a little overpriced based on other excellent restaurants in the area.  Although the atmosphere was romantic, I had a hard time reading the menu and the bill using just the votive candle on the table.  There has to be a better way!~~#~0
I have long liked Tempe Maretplace since it has opened.                                                 It is a good location, lots of parking all around. Since when live in the extreme heat it is a bit nice that it is outdoors.              There is a major selection or stores ,restaurants and services here.  My girlfriend likes it as well. So it is a win win set up. They are decorated really well and they have a multitude of events here. Even a Barnes and Noble,which bookstores are not that easy to come accross now days.~~#~1
yummy..  you will love this place.  I love to sit on the patio on a nice day and enjoy!   the sangria is amazing..  and lettuce wraps soooo great!!  give it a try!~~#~1
After bad experience, I will never return.  It is terrible since they didn't meet my expectation and the price is outrageous.  The most difficult part of the Pho is the broth (req 16 hours of preparation) and it tasted like water.  I had to add all kind of condiments to rescue it but can't even eat it.  The restaurant is very slow now and it confirmed what I meant with Asian restaurant.  If your fellow Asians don't patronize the place, it is  because your food did not meet our expectation.  Try across the street to the Rice plate Kim Thanh for their rice dish.  It is night and day.~~#~1
Bike cabs beware! You've got nothing on this rig! Tour de Tavern is a tribute to tipsy teamwork and a perfect way to host a unique group event. As "pedalers" on their inaugural tour, we enjoyed the celebrity treatment of cruising down the winding streets of Old Town Scottsdale as onlookers snapped photos and cheered us on!We rocked out to top 40 hits and, by special request, our Lonely Island favorites on their awesome sound system. Our guides were flexible and let our party run the show. If we needed more time for let's say...... an impromptu horseback ride in front of Shotgun Betty's, they were more than happy to wait. As an added bonus everyone gets to burn off some of those unwanted cocktail calories in between your favorite watering holes. If you are concerned that after a few stops (and a few shots) your legs might lose some of that forward momentum, there are a few coveted "non pedaling" seats in the back of the bike. We all compromised with a friendly and fair rotation system. Our tour guides were helpful, accommodating, and entertaining. They even proved to be exceedingly patient upon discovering that we did in facts have "that guy" in our group. If you're saying to yourself,  "Such a marvelous experience could only cost an arm and least the majority of a leg" then you would be wrong! With the cost of gas being substituted for sheer earth friendly man power, our group of fifteen people spent less than $30 bucks each for the experience.But wait, there's more! Included in this price are all the amazing special deals that Tour de Tavern exclusively brings you at select bars along the route. On our tour we were offered drinks specials ranging from $3 to ONE PENNY!  I say this in all caps because it's ONE PENNY!So next time you are planning an event, I recommend Tour de Tavern 100%!"Look Ma! No hands!"~~#~1
Was in town for a business meeting and tried to catch a movie with a friend. First impression of the place was that it needed a total make over.  I mean TOTAL MAKEOVER. Walked up to buy my ticket, and the lady was a total jerk! She had no idea when the movie times were, and she clearly thought we were stupid. She messed up our change, and didn't believe us when we told her. When we walked in they ripped the tickets out of our hands.  When it came time to order our food, the butter on the popcorn tasted like cough syrup. The theater was extremely dirty, and kids were screaming throughout the movie.  After the movie I politely told the manager about our horrible experience.  He was not understanding at all and even threatened to kick us out. I was appaled by this whole endeavor and that is why I am writing this review. It was a complete waste of time and money and I recommend everyone to stay away.~~#~1
Costco Travel - My husband and I recently returned from a trip to the Big Island, HI that we arranged throught Costco Travel. After shopping around I found that their prices were the best and after one phone call I was able to make all arrangements for airfair, condo and car. They didn't have arrangements with any B&Bs on Hilo but were able to adjust our travel dates. Everything went according to plan with all arrangements being accurate. Condo was outstanding and a great value. We got gas and did some souvenier shopping at the Costco in Kona and again saved $$.   I've shopped at Costco for years - now becoming a groupie!~~#~1
I got the chicken burger today, it is pretty good.  Grilled, juicy, and cooked just right.  The fries are always hot and crispy.  The wait for the food took a little longer than normal, but I know they are very busy.  Bummer our service this time was a totally miss.  At first she was great, check came took our drink order and food at the same time (we were ready).  She checked on us after our food arrived and we ever saw her again until the bill.  We both were so thirsty, NO REFILLS.  She offered us later that she can bring our refills in a to go cup.  That is great, but I would have liked a drink with my food instead of choking it down.~~#~0
Okay so lets clear one thing up.. this place is a dump. But for under $20 a night it is a-okay for me. With all the money we saved I've got some extra cash to hit the strip club that sits directly in front. All kidding aside this place has impeccable location and is pretty much only a couple miles away from anything you can think to do. Of course the rooms are a little outdated and boring but its only a place to rest your head. And you can do that in peace. This has to be one of the quietest hotels I've been too. Almost seems like everyone is scared away from Christie's out front..~~#~0
I don't drink, so my review will not be intoxicated by anything except the building.  I gave it two stars for the building.  They did a beautiful job with the remodel (I'm a mid-century and Haver fan.)  The food wasn't anything to write home about.  I have to admit that I'm particularly tough on restaurants filled with...I don't know what to call them...scenesters, I guess.  Service was ok.  Its not BAD, mind you, its just that I don't get it.  I guess if you're paying with credit cards all the time, you don't care how much mediocre food costs, as long as it makes you feel cool about eating there.~~#~0
I joined a friend for a two hour evening ride at CCO. We were the only two riders, may be because it was a Sunday eve and all the tourists were drinking their mimosas by their hotel pools.The horses looked very well taken care of. Mine was 17 year old Sundance, a beautiful brown male. I've never ridden before, and he was easy to control. Our guide Ed was patient, funny and awesome company. He showed me the basics and was always there with a word of encouragement and a tip or two.Tip for the guys, if you plan to trot, wear tight jeans, you will be thankful at the end of the day. The city slicker that I am,I left my phone in my shirt pocket, ended up dropping it while on the ride and Ed helped us go look for it. The desert, sun set over the mountains and the sandstorm about 30 miles away all made this a very memorable evening.I highly recommend CCO.~~#~1
Last night (Friday night) was the first time I had been back to Myst in years. The club is nice, but the promoter for Friday nights is urban... and not classy urban... like kinda hood urban.... BUT I must say that it's a fairly mixed crowd. Black... White... Hispanic... I was surprised to see all different types of hood folks out. Now, this usually wouldn't have been my crowd of choice, but my girlfriend and I were feeling adventurous. Long story short, the bartender was awesome and the wait for drinks wasn't too bad. They averaged about $10/cocktail. The cover was $15 and $35 for VIP (which allows you access to upstairs... not worth it. It's a recession and the dance floor is downstairs...) I'm not sure who the DJ was but he was really good. It was like all the best of Gucci Mane and all that Southern type club music... very good stuff. I gave a rating of 3 stars b/c while this isn't a place many of my friends would want to go to in the future on this particular night, it was a decent night IF this is the crowd you're looking for. Hey folks... I don't judge lol...~~#~0
SIMPLY AMAZING!  WE LOVE IT!My hubby and I stopped in one day after deciding NOT to go to NYPD. They were next door, and we thought lets try something new. We have been there 3 times since. You sit, and the food comes by and you just grab what you want off the rotating bar. ITS GREAT! Especially if you can not decide what you want until seeing it. We ate like King and Queen for $20.00.They have simple pricing, and it is affordable for a date or family.~~#~1
I'd have to disagree with the person who said this restaurant is dog friendly.  I was told off by the owner because I had a little dog outside table and that was right after I finished paying for an overpriced breakfast dish and coffee.  I went here before that on several occasions and many times my order was forgotten, after paying....and the staff is real unprofessional blasting music at nightclub volume at early breakfast and lunch times.  I'm a neighbor, but will never go here again!!!!~~#~1
I have been going to Tish's studio for years now! When it comes to choosing a studio to practice at, the environment and the instructors are crucially important. Hegel Yoga provides an incredible atmosphere to practice yoga, and the variety of classes available leaves little to be desired!Great energy, great instructors, great studio.~~#~1
DUDE..where is the manga....where are the card tables. .....What the heck is this place doing selling comics! This is outrageous!  And why are you talking to me and trying to help me comic clerk! Your job is to give me a huge sigh and exasperated look as if I asked you to perform surgery. This being helpful and friendly is really bothering me. You guys are just too weird. I need to go back to Atomic.~~#~1
Good food, clean, with a friendly helpful staff.  Price seems a little high for the caliber of food.  Would give it 3.5 stars.~~#~0
Best happy hour in north Scottsdale! Get there early to beat the crowd. Amazing cuisine and atmosphere.~~#~1
Love this lake. Went paddle boarding a few weeks back here and had the best time. Lake water is so clean you can almost see the bottom. Highly recommend this lake if you love water sports and fishing :)~~#~1
This gym is great...  I joined because it opened only about 3 minutes away from my house.  I keep going back because every person who works there is so nice and greets you with a smile and a friendly hello.  It is not intimidating at all, which is a big step up from the LA Fitness that I used to go to.  The staff gets to know you by name and most of the other members are quite friendly as well.   The gym is open enough that you can do free weights on your own without bumping into anyone and there are always plenty of cardio machines available.   I've been going there for over a year and plan to continue doing so!~~#~1
All I have to say is get the California Club. I live in the East Coast and I still crave for the sandwich. I wish I had the chance to try other things on the menu. The drive-thru concept is pretty neat, but there was a bit of a wait. Guess you can't rush perfection.~~#~1
This is the BEST hit or miss bargain spot for everything. I frequently find great deals on quality body care products (be sure you know how to read the labels, there's a lot of low quality products in the mix), designer sun glasses, shoes, clothing, housewares, baby shower gifts, pet gifts, and guy gifts. It seems I go at peak hours, where lines are incredibly long. I see it as a small price for Macy's quality at a Walmart price.~~#~1
A prospective customer at Sakana must check out the Customer Appreciation Sushi Roll menu before ordering from the "main" menu. Customer Appreciation rolls are the full size rolls at most Japanese restaurants in California and tastes just as good if not better.$7 for 5 large cuts of Hamachi sashimi. Add $2 for a bowl of sushi rice and you will be in sashimi heaven. The Ikura at this restaurant are the best I have ever tasted anywhere.Beers for as afforadable as $3.25. Sodas with free refills for $1.95.Can you find this quality at these prices in Scottsdale? I didn't think so!~~#~1
Ted's rules.  Great char-grilled hot dogs, killer onion rings, and a great atmosphere all add up to a good old dog-eatin' experience.~~#~1
I'll be charitable - this place sucks!I went there because a friend had *exactly* the piece of furniture I needed and he got his from Ikea.   After wandering around the store forever, I finally found the right department.The people working there were cold. uncaring. not helpful. no concept of customer service.  I left in disgust!Couple of days later, I was in Cost Plus World Market @ 18th St. & Camelback.  Voila!  I fould what I wanted - for close to the same price.  the BIG difference:  Warm smiles, friendly people, volunteered to go out of their way to help me.  Felt like I was among long-time friends!  They even delivered when they said they would.And, no need to drive half way to tucson and back!Ikea?  Don't be foolish.  Cost Plus?  Now, there's a place that earned my repeat business!~~#~1
Love this place! Amazing Happy Hour Specials!!~~#~1
Perfect place for a hot summer day.  Amazing paletas!  Friendly staff and fresh ingredients.  Welcoming environment in downtown Chandler.~~#~1
This is by far my favourite department store, hands down. I have had nothing but perfect experiences in this store, without exception, no matter what department I'm in. The shoe SA's will bend over backwards to help you find a specific shoe, and the staff will even go so far as to send out hand-written thank you cards to your home address after you make a purchase - big or small. Tim & Anthony in the shoe salon are fabulous beyond words! I am not completely sure that I understand why people complain about the amount of merchandise on the floor or the lack of crowds in this store. Frankly, I would rather not be bombarded with merchandise and other people. One of the things I love the most about Barney's is not only the prompt attention of SA's, but the fact that they aren't rushing around trying to help 35 people at once. The SA's at Barney's are incredibly friendly and will stop to have an actual conversation, regardless or whether you are purchasing something or not. I have also never experienced a "high pressure" sale situation here.All in all, Barneys is pricey, and there is no getting around it. But, um, so is Neiman's and that place is a crock. Anywhere that ONLY accepts American Express or their charge card and then treats you like scum if you aren't carrying neither is no place that I want to spend my hard earned dollars. Yay Barneys!~~#~1
Guacamole was best I've had!~~#~1
Love Bakers. I live in Glendale an it is worth the drive to go see them. They know their stuff and am always pleased with my purchases.~~#~1
Excellent.~~#~1
3 stars is being generous.Went to Tesoro tonight with my husband and two teenagers based on the glowing yelp reviews.  It is a very small restaurant, 9 - 10 tables with a small waiting area out in front, facing the strip mall parking lot.  We had a reservation for 7:30.  Arrived on time and were apologetically told that our table was not yet ready.   Had to wait out front for 20 minutes shivering.After we were seated, drink, wine, and appetizer orders taken, we relaxed and began to settle in.  Problem was, it is a very loud room. Conversation was a challenge.  Looking around, we realized that we were the youngest table in the room.  Average age appeared to be 60+ years old. Oh, well, young and hip it is not.  Hopefully the food is good. Bruschetta and antipasto were tasty.  For entrees, we ordered the homemade Fettuccine Bolognese, Spaghetti al Pomodoro, the Chicken Saltimbocca and a special, Farfalle with shrimp and asparagus.  Flavors were good, not great, but none of the pasta was homemade.  Very much a disappointment.On the upside, service was very attentive and friendly.  Unfortunately, food is only mediocre, and the strip mall location is a definite detraction in size and ambiance.  Would I return again?  No.~~#~0
Terrific food and service. Happy hour from 3-6 is totally worth it for the free children's meals and half price drinks. The french onion burger is delicious!~~#~1
Some of the best pizza I've ever had. The sauce is amazing. Every time I'm in town I get the sausage and pepperoni with extra sauce.There's nothing else to say, really. Go here for good pizza.~~#~1
Great Pizza. Great Service.We've been here a few times since it opened. And always look forward to going. We have never had a bad experience. Each time has been great. Our waiter Dave was perfect, always on the ball.~~#~1
I just had a pretty unfortunate experience at Bison Witches in Tempe.  I remember liking this place when I went to ASU but not anymore!  It literally (no exaggeration) took 1.5 hours for our lunch, which was 3 people eating soups and sandwiches.  Our order took 45 minutes to arrive at our table (again, soup and sandwiches!), and several tables around us that had come in AFTER us, got food before us.  I normally am pretty easy going about stuff like this, but the server and a guy that appeared to be a manager/owner didn't even acknowledge the long wait time, no apology, nothing.  They weren't even that busy!  Our server barely even spoke to us when she came to the table, and acted like we were inconveniencing her.  I also saw her roll her eyes at another one of her tables as they got up to leave.  What kind of service is that!?  I wish I could say the food was any saving grace, but it wasn't.  Mediocre soup in a bread bowl, less than mediocre turkey on a bland sandwich.  I will NOT be going back, there's no point!  Save your time and money and hit up another one of the tasty places on Mill Ave.  Trust me, you'll be better off!~~#~1
DECEMBER 2012:They still have the ANGRY WHOPPER!!!!!Best whopper EVER.Mine goes no lettuce, heavy onion, heavy tomato, and BBQ sauce on the bottom bun.It's THICK.55 year anniversary --- second whopper 55 cents!DEAL!!!Really, have you ever had a BAD whopper? :)~~#~1
I've been coming here for a little over a year and I can't say that I've ever been really all that impressed.  Yes, they "hand wash" your car but I feel like that's the only pro on the actual cleaning of my car.  I've never really been happy with the vacuuming, not sure that they really do anything other than the mats.  When I get in my car all the old fuzz and hair is still on the seats.  The last 2 times I've been there they've missed cleaning parts of my car and I have to say something.  The last time they cleaned 3 out of 4 of my tires, even a stranger commented to me about how he found it odd they missed it.  Also, asked for air freshener and when I got in my car it still smelled like ummm, well it didn't smell fresh and clean.  I just left there and again I had to ask them clean the inside door.  It was covered in dirt and dead grass, how do you miss that?!? When I called someone over to clean it he then noticed that the wind shield was still dirty.  I mean, really?? And again, no air freshener even though I asked for it.I gave 3 stars instead of 2 because I do appreciate the fact that this is not a chain.  I'd rather give my money to a family owned spot instead of some corporate junk.   The tall, blonde woman who greats you is always very nice and helpful.  I like that I'm not hounded about getting my windshield or cracks fixed a million times and sometimes they offer deals on LivingSocial which is great. Overall I feel like this is a good place to come and just have the surface of your car washed unless you want to pay big bucks to actually see a difference in the inside of your car.  Make sure you check your car before leaving to ensure they have actually cleaned everything.~~#~0
this was our first breakfast hit-up since we moved back, and gotta say it again....the protein pancakes are still da bomb. so lucious, cruchy yet soft, sweet yet salty, healthy but so much syrup...mmmm! go at an off time or you'll be knocking elbows with the elderly.~~#~1
AWESOME!!! I love this place! I am from Seattle and I've been struggling to find a good pho restaurant since moving out here. Khai Hoan reminds me of some of the restaurants I used to go to back home.  I love hole-in-the-wall family restaurants like this one. No fuss, no frills. Just good food and fast service.We were greeted, seated, ordered and got our appetizer in 10 minutes. Food was delicious!!! Definitely go here!~~#~1
They have on campus night classes for MBA students, which works out well for people looking to continue their education.  Some teachers care, others just use it for the pay check.  The accounting classes have been great, some of the others have been terrible.  There is a ton of counselor turnover, but they put too much stress on those people for the amount of work they do.  If your employer will pay for it, an MBA on the resume can help a bit.  At least they are quick to provide information on their programs and admissions process, unlike ASU who just want you to pay the application fee.~~#~0
I had a facial with Jennifer and it was fantastic!  She used all proper techniques and overall it was a very relaxing and wonderful experience.  Would definitely recommend this spa for anyone living or vacationing in the area.~~#~1
Pretty good coffee. Nothing special but better than starbucks by far.~~#~0
Perhaps if I waited outside in the heat for an hour plus to the point that I became starved and dehydrated, I too would have thought Matt's was worthy of 5 stars. Or maybe the 5 star reviews come from people too ashamed to admit that they wasted most of their morning on a very average breakfast.In my case, we came here before 7am on a Friday and got the last available seats by the window. Service was great; I didn't detect any attitudes from the waitstaff that has been mentioned in some reviews. They got our meal out quickly and made sure our coffee mugs never got empty.With the exception of the toast and jam, the food never rose above "good." Isn't that pretty sad that the best offering from a breakfast diner is the bread? I liked my waffle since it was a bit crisper than what I can do at home with my geriatric waffle iron, but there was nothing noteworthy about the flavor. My husband said his eggs were cooked perfectly with his chop and chick dish, but the pork chop was under-seasoned. He found the hashbrowns way too greasy to be enjoyable, and the bacon suffered from being overcooked.Maybe we're spoiled since we have two great breakfast places within walking distance (Joe's Farm Grill and the Coffee Shop). Matt's just isn't worth the drive or wait.~~#~0
First time there the other night.  Friday night, not very crowded for 7:30pm.  We were shown to a table in what looked like a back room - the table was not set, there was just a tablecloth and that was it.  The room is to the right as you walk in.  There were only 2 other tables in there and the windows were covered (no view) - it was weird so I immediately asked to be seated in the main part of the restaurant.  Decor seemed 'cheap' - just my initial impression.  Food was pretty good.  Pancetta wrapped shrimp app was good; Service was good.  Entrees were pretty good - Chicken Parm, Fettucine Bolognese all tasty, but not sure I would go back.  Caesar salad was a bit disappointing...asked for anchovies on the side - never delivered.~~#~0
Yum, yum, yum. I have put this in my regular rotation for every time I'm in Gilbert.  They have great sandwiches, sides, and burgers and for the most part we have had some fantastic service (my friend has had one or two iffy experiences but mine have all been great)... this past weekend I had one of their burgers of the week which had some white wine grilled onions with Gruyere cheese and it was KILLER, probably my fave burger I've had there.  I've also tried their soups which have been great and their grilled cheese.  The Caprese Pasta Salad is so refreshing and a fave side of mine!~~#~1
Filthy place.  Bad tasteless food.  Rude waitress.  Yuck!!!!~~#~1
I love this place!We weren't sure what to expect since the restaurant is in an office building plaza.  Kinda weird, but the employees in the other businesses are lucky!We went in here on a whim after reading all the awesome Yelp reviews.  Our first impression was a girl at the front and she was super nice and didn't rush us while we were checking out the menu options.I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with macaroni & cheese and my husband ordered the brisket sandwich with a side of baked beans.  He also ordered a side of ribs to sample.  The wait wasn't too bad -- it took about 10 or 15 minutes and it was ready to go.  They are cool with their sauce and let you fill up the small plastic cups and take as much as you want of it (which is awesome, because the sauce tastes SO good!).   It's a nice, thick sauce and they have several flavors to choose from.We go to a nearby area to have a little picnic by ourselves and notice that they forgot to include the side of ribs.  We pack everything up and go back to get those.  The employees were really nice about it and apologized and gave my husband the side of ribs.  We repeat the same process and realize that they also messed up my husband's order and gave him a pulled pork sandwich instead of the brisket sandwich.  We decide to let it go and eat our food.The pulled pork has great flavor.  The meat actually tastes like it has been smoked for several hours and is good enough to eat on its own without any sauce.  However, we weren't going that route, because the sauce is too damn good not to eat.  The baked beans and macaroni & cheese were not anything special, but they were good.  The ribs were our favorite part!  We absolutely loved them.  Very tender and the sauce they chose to slather them in was delicious.This place is pretty far from where we live, but we would definitely go out of our way (again) to eat here more.~~#~1
I love the fish tacos from Rubios, I always order them. Well sometimes I get the shrimp or Salmon tacos and I also love that black salsa chipotle sauce and the chips are delish here.~~#~1
Tried this for dinner one night.  Had the hot and sour soup, which was good.  Partner had the won ton soup, but had to ask for crispy won tons to add to the soup.  I had a diet coke to drink, but I swear there was alcohol in the glass - I sent it back and the same happened again.  i tasted my partners and her's was fine - not sure what was going on there.I had kung pao beef - it was a little too crispy.  My partner had the shrimp version (she wanted scallops but they were out !) - she said it was excellent.Liked the decor, but a bit pricey for what you got.~~#~0
Every time I visit Arizona I love to eat here to food is vary good and I have my wife to thank for turning me on too this restaurant I wish they would have some in Georgia~~#~1
I've been to happy hour here on a few occasions now and I have to say that I'm becoming more and more fond of Geisha. The prices are pretty decent, but what really makes this a great happy hour place is the ambience - it's lively and fun!Happy hour is 4p - 7p every day and is half off sake bombs, appetizers, house sushi rolls...and I just realized specialty drinks as well! I need to go back so I can try the Hello Kitty and Harajuku Lover specialty drinks! Both look delicious. Not the most amazing sushi and appetizers, but definitely not bad considering the price. And for me during happy hour anyway, it's really more about the company and drinks than the food.Happy Happy Hour Hopping!~~#~0
i always forget about this place when we do a party. they carry costumes and party gear year round...even halloween stuff. stopped in today to look for a flintstones costume but they had no Fred's and the wilma they had for 50 bucks, we bought on-line for 30 bucks. i had an online coupon for 15 bucks so i only bought house decor for halloween. but if you need any kind of prop for a costume/theme party, bike pub ride, or just feel like dressing up, this place is perfect!~~#~1
If you're looking for a lunch salad/Sandwich, this place is great.  Not too busy, but that's good because it's very quaint.  The roost beef and bluecheese sandwich will fill your stomach and the cookie side is a nice treat.~~#~1
Not really memorable but, good dependable Chinese food. I like the space too.~~#~0
Don't judge a book by it's cover.  The outside doesn't look so great, but you go inside and it's gorgeous.  The food is some of the best food I've ever eaten.  Their sugar cane chicken appetizer is fantastic!! The pad thai, chiang mai noodles, pad kra po, pad lard na, etc.  This place is so flavorful with fresh veggies and fresh herbs.  And don't get me started on their fried honey banana dessert.  The best dessert I've ever had!  Check this place out you will not be disappointed.~~#~1
I WISH I LIVED IN SCOTTSDALE. I stopped by Yogurtland because I went to Spring Training, and I wish I could have stayed forever. The quality of the frozen yogurt is impeccable. So many flavors! I mixed Raspberry Cheesecake with Vanilla Bean, also tried the PB&J flavor (um, YES!?), Tangerine Tango, and my usual go-to, Tart. Very extensive toppings bar. Good price as well, I just love froyo. Next time I'm in Scottsdale, this will be one of the first places I go to!~~#~1
Poor service-small portions-pricey~~#~1
Excellent neighborhood spot with outstanding food, large portions and reasonable price. The staff make you feel special and I have not made a bad menu choice. Try the wings with sauce on the side or the Monday night fried chicken. Lunch or dinner, Wallys receives 5 stars from me.~~#~1
Those of us "foodies" know that if the company is not good, the food is not good...regardless...which is why I am happy to give Bar North such a great review.  I was there with a terrific group of people [STAR 1].  We were able to relax on the patio (with clean furniture, I might add) overlooking the fountains, in an intimate setting where we could hear one another [STAR 2].  The wine list was good, at a fair (i.e., expected) price [STAR 3].  The appetizers and salads were awesome [STAR 4].  And the waitstaff (Damn, I wish I could remember her name!) was incredible [STAR 5].  'nough said.~~#~1
I prefer going to this location of Macayo's over the others because of the ambience. It's way different than the others and it doesn't "feel" like the other Macayo's. This one is much more festive. It has a ton of patio seating and lots of shade. The antique train outside makes it much more interesting. The parking lot, however, is right next to the light rail tracks and it's small, so parking is a little dicey. They sacrificed parking for patio seating. The prices are extremely affordable. Their food is very good. Service is always consistent. Cheap margaritas. I've never been here on a weekend. I always stop in on a weekday around noon and then it has some business people on lunch.~~#~1
This ice has the abilty to make you feel COLD on a 100+ degree day - I am hooked on the Key Lime, Alex's Lemonade, and Florida Orange. Very nice staff, friendly and free samples ....~~#~1
Each time I eat here...I always look at the menu and end up having the same thing - the ceasar salad with salmon. Nothing else really interests me on the menu. The service is good - no complaints there. But its nothing special. But I will tel you this - there is nothing like a cold beer on a hot day!~~#~0
This is the new mecca of Phoenix music. Charlie Levy who booked for the now legendary Nita's Hideaway and also the owner of Stateside Presents is the man behind it all! He is a music fan first and ... well ... that's just what he is ... a music fan not a natural businessman. The place is just beautiful (for now, soon to be broken with the wear and tear of rock and roll no doubt). The room is small ... stage big (for the size) ... no doubt this is going to be the best place in the city to see any band for a long time to come!Thank you Charlie!Music fans unite! This place MUST thrive!btw ... they have live music every single night of the week ... and they open at 4pm every day (the lounge will have musicians and DJs for your entertainment).~~#~1
Went here for brunch this morning (Sunday) and there were a few things that diminished the experience for me:* You claim New Mexican grub and then you charge for chips and salsa or sopapillas which are standard complements to any New Mexican restaurant meal.* At $3, the coffee is  a rip off! Seriously? We're not talking cappuccino, people and you're selling build-your-own Bloody Marys for the same price!* The carne adovada was tender but not very spicy.That said:* The green salsa was really good.* I'm so desperate for carne adovada, I'll settle. (besides, $9 is more than a fair price for 3 eggs, black beans and carne adovada in a bowl on a flour tortilla - even if it was more beans than pork.)* There are several options for $5; and, if they are all like the eggs benedict, they are generous portions.* The patio is nice and the bar area feels like a neighborhood pub (not a cave, but that's not got to be a bad thing!)~~#~0
LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!! Best Mexican food we have had in Arizona yet. We are partial as we just bought in Fountain Hills and its close, but its also small and although lively, never crowded or noisy. The service is friendly and fast and the Mexican style music is great but not too loud. You can easily talk and relax. Loved the guacomole dip and shrimp cocktail and the fried ice cream is fab and big enough for four people!!!~~#~1
I think that most of the negative reviews I've read about this Gold's gym really stem from people's own insecurities. I have been going here almost 2 months now and have never had a single issue with the gym or ANY of its staff or members! I find the staff to be extremely friendly and helpful, and I was even offered a free personal training session when I signed up to help me get on the right track to meeting my fitness goals! I read one review about some poor girl stepping onto a treadmill that was going full speed and falling off... who does that?? Did she not see the treadmill going FULL SPEED? Don't blame lack of common sense on the gym or its staff...Another review complained that there are too many gay men hanging out in the locker room. REALLY? As a straight male, I can say that I've never felt uncomfortable, and have never been solicited for sex in the locker room. Get over yourself and your homophobia dude. Some yelpers truly disgust me....Great location in a beautiful new area, convenient hours, tons of parking, a BEAUTIFUL state of the art facility.... what is there to complain about?? Show up, work out hard, and go home feeling better about yourself... that's what gyms are for!!~~#~1
This place is a dump. I'm a widow, and I have a long-term chronic condition, still, they allowed their tenant to pick on me, throw a bottle at me, then their maintenance person told me the lock was never changed, They did not paint, but lied and said they did. It's totally drug-infested, They don't keep their word.  I would skip it.~~#~1
OMG - whenever I get around to composing a "Worst Bathrooms" list, this place will be near the top for sure.  I spend a decent amount of time at this Barnes & Noble and have 'used the facilities' a number of times as well.  At the very minimum, there's always toilet paper all over the floor and at least one or two un-flushed toilets - with 'number two.'  Really, people...  Last night, in addition to the usual messiness, I kid you not  - there was an enormous cucumber sitting on the toilet paper holder in one of the stalls, and a padlock with two keys on the floor.  As I sat 'doing my business' I couldn't help but contemplate whether these objects were some sort of weird clues for a scavenger hunt, a murder mystery, or something equally disturbing.  (Needless to say, I got out of there as quickly as I could rather than looking around for more "clues.")Other than that, it's a typical Barnes & Noble complete with a Starbucks Cafe.  The book and media selection is solid; no complaints.  Upstairs they have large comfortable chairs that are just perfect when you want to plop down with a stack of materials that you want to read cover to cover without actually purchasing them.  Just don't stay too long or you might have to visit the scary bathrooms.~~#~0
Still flying solo.  My friends took me for dinner here and it was excellent.  Humus appetizer was great.  For main course did broiled chicken pita wrap and it was perfect.  Recommend!~~#~1
one of my favorite places !   the place has great atmosphere and character.  the bar is a great place to unwind with friends (or meet new ones) or have dinner.  Michael or Jan will take great care of you at the bar!    The full menu is offered here.the dining area is warm, elegant, & comfortable, but you are fine to wear your favorite blue jeans.....it is cave creek. you know!i have never ordered anything from the menu that did not impress.    regardless of where i dine, if there is a rib eye on the menu, i have to try it. Cartwrights rib eye (cooked over mesquite) is consistently  my favorite!!!    from the fish dept, the sea bass is succulent!     my second favorite is the scallops. they too are cooked over wood and have great flavor/texture and are seared perfectly.you have to save room for desert......the apple fritters pair well with their local fresh roasted coffee.you can not go wrong at Cartwrights!~~#~1
Just like the other yogurt places for selection.Good news they had a vegan type for those of you who care. To be honest i ended up getting that one. I am not vegan by any means, but i do love a more icy texture and less/no creaminess when i have a cold dessert. one negative is they are poorly staffed. Busy sunday afternoon and only one kid working there. felt bad for the poor guy. But i didn't feel bad for too long after as i mentioned to him that the mochi was bad and didn't really taste like it. He said "yeah it's not the normal rainbow kind, but this is what i call the albino mochi"... i tried not to laugh at that comment, but yeah, normal is his "albino" mochi...anyways don't get the mochi here...something is soo off about it. I can't put my finger on it. It's like an oopsie child  between a marshmallow and "albino" mochi. LOL~~#~0
This was the perfect place for the family after a day at the resort.  The food was good, especially the barbeque chicken.  The kids menu was wonderful.  My only complaint was that the server really could not answer questions about the menu.~~#~0
Yes, I can agree it is not perfect, but at least they are trying to do something different.  I didn't eat there and since I was a designated driver I only had soda.  I really enjoyed the stand up.  It is a great place to see some local performers start their career.~~#~0
I love this mall. You need a giant mall like this when it is 120 degrees outside! It is one of the only indoor malls that I like. I feel so calm when I am here. You can find just about anything in this mall.  The food court is pretty good.  I like Paradise Cafe for sandwiches.  There are sit down restaurants and a movie theater inside as well.  Plenty of parking or you can just valet.  My favorite Nordstroms is here.  I find the Nordies in SF to be too big and overwhelming.  The one at the Fashion Square is minimalist, well organized, and edited to suit my tastes.~~#~1
great service, great food, and great outdoor seating made for a wonderful first time experience at this charming little restaurant.you would think that sitting outside eating in the middle of august summertime in phoenix would be practically unbearable. local breeze made it tolerable and i don't think my overly-sweaty ass ever felt uncomfortable once during the whole dining experience. they had fans, a swamp cooler, and misters going and it made for a comfortable and charming outdoor dining venture.we started off with the greek lavosh which was to die for. the cheese they melted on top of it will make any cheese lover weak in the knees. their mojiot lemonade was crisp and refreshing. ok selection of beers, certainly not the greatest but i picked out a favorite, kiltlifter, to go with my coca-cola ham sandwich. my girlfirned (Rachel O.) went with the atomic burger as we are both fans of spicy food and this burger comes topped with horseradish. it even made her face scrunch up and me quiver in my seat the moment it hit my tongue and you better believe i enjoyed every second of it. the coca cola ham was HUGE and both of us only managed to eat half of it. leftovers are always good.service was spot on, and i enjoyed the decor and atmosphere despite what many people have complained about before. get over it, it's no longer pallete, move on, and enjoy the local breeze.~~#~1
This is not my first time eating at a Picazzo's, but the first time I've been to the one in Casa Grande. Previously, I had been to one in Sedona that had a large, modern feel to it--kinda medium upscale. I was expecting that again, but didn't quite get it.This location is TINY. My entire family was meeting here as a halfway between Tucson and Phoenix, and our party of 12 pretty much took up the whole restaurant. Luckily, we were the only ones there, as we had a few small children in our group who were very interested in exploring and walking around to everyone at the table.The ambiance is more of a classic italian restaurant in this location, and definitely not upscale. Its not tablecloths, its paper that the kids could draw on with crayons. I'm not poo pooing on that, as it worked out well for our group, but its just not what I was expecting.The service was pretty good, maybe a little on the slow side, but not overly so. The pizzas are delicious, and the menu is pretty extensive. I had a pesto and goat cheese pizza, and also tried the bbq chicken. I think between the two, I liked the bbq chicken better, but they were both seriously good. The prices are a little steep, but manageable. For dessert, some people tried the pizza cookie with ice cream, and someone else tried a brownie with ice cream. There was very little ice cream on either one and it was mostly melted by the time it came to the table. The cookie was overdone and the brownie was dry and not particularly delicious. Wont be ordering either again should I return.~~#~0
So I ventured in here today for a quick nosy hoping to see what was on sale. I figured nothing in these economic times could be TOO expensive...They had a lot of their items FULL PRICE much to my disdain, but I was pleasantly surprised to find a large bin on throw pillows for 75% I personally was in need for some and bought some super cute ones for $6.00 each originally $35.00 yeah great deal!!! So I was a happy camper...I even found two that matched that weren't damaged SCORE...They were setting up for Christmas so it was a little jumbled, but they had some cute Halloween stuff out but it was weird half the stuff was marked down and half wasn't, it was so confusing I just passed. I don't like the guessing game, either mark down the season or don't KWIM?All in all though a typical Pier One except for how disjointed everything was it was hard to find things, and they just don't have the cute sets of furniture like they used to :(~~#~0
My brother also posted about our Mother's Day experience. These must be franchises because the Scottsdale and Chandler locations are like eating at a different restaurant entirely. This is the second and last time we will frequent this location. The pizza and calzones were awful.~~#~1
I took a friend from Europe here this past week. I cannot express how much the attention to detail is welcomed and so wonderfully presented. By this I mean, the service, the presentation, the food, the atmosphere. The staff knows that when you walk in, you will be spending good money and they expect to take care of your whim and cater to your palette. The steaks are buttery, delicious and worth every bite. The sommelier made a wonderful suggestion to go with our order and he was spot on in his selection. This may not be the place to dine on a regular basis for some, but if you plan to make a special night of an occasion, I recommend highly Ruth's Chris. I have not been to the one in Phoenix, only the Scottsdale location, but I would be hard pressed to say that it would be any less tasty. My buddy was treated so kindly and his comment (paraphrased) was as follows: It's too bad that so much of the world hates Americans. They think that Americans are so loud and bossy. They can be so kind and so willing to to be helpful when they want. In Europe, no one cares if you are from France or Italy or Dernmark because we are like states next to each other. In America, everyone wants to know about where you are from and want to hear you talk about it and the places you have been.Thank you to the staff for being a part of my friend's visit.~~#~1
I had heard many great things about Penzey's, but it wasn't until recently that I actually went to the store. After shopping around and smelling various spices, I wanted to buy everything in the store! Great for gifts as well!~~#~1
Love it!The food is VERY spicy though.  Luckily, I have burned off all of my taste buds so far from all my mexican food endeavors, however, the wussies out there should take note :)Just realize that this place is VERY small and can get VERY crowded.I was there once and George W Bush came in to eat there.  Evidently he loves the food.~~#~1
It was a very lovely place. I had read the reviews before arriving and had read that the place looked dated, but it looked very nice to me. I've been to several hilton family hotels since my hubby is a diamond member and this is one of the better places we've been to.The only thing that was sorta a deal breaker was that it wasn't near downtown.~~#~1
One of my fave restaurants! The unlimited salad is a winner. It's delicious! They also have a gluten-free selection that my brother loves! For Christmas, they also have some gift card deals.~~#~1
Michael C is right. This place is very charming. I love the inside decor, with brick walls. I love the "No Sniveling" sign hanging behind the bar.It's a small place, but that's part of the appeal. There's a small upstairs patio, with a fireplace (wasn't on when I went) that could be a great spot to hang. It's not much of a view, but there's something cool about being at a higher elevation. Finding J. Chew was a little bit of a challenge. We ended up stopping at AZ88 to ask for directions. LOL! When we arrived, my friend and I sashayed up to the bar. Immediately we had a drink menu in front of us. I was more intrigued by the huge crystal ball-esque 20 Questions game. I wanted to play!When I asked about beer, the 'tender motioned to the shelf above his head. Ahh... Not a great selection, but it'll do. I went with the Honey Brown. $4.50. Great price. Okay beer. I'll order something else next time, if I can make up my mind. Stella? Fat Tire? Hmm... The whole reason for venturing to J. Chew was for a celebration. My friend was getting married, and this was her final Saturday night as a "single." So, the group of women sat outside on the small patio area. It was a cold, chilly May evening and they had the fireplace going. They also had a couple heat lamps working, but most of them were out of propane. Bummer. We Phoenix Dwellers were shivering our coconuts off, if you know what I mean. (Praise Allah for fingerless gloves, which were a big hit that night.) But, the bartender did try and keep them going, so we appreciated his efforts!Overall, I like J Chew. Yet I can't rate it higher than 3.5 for a few reasons. Yes, one is the beer selection. While it's small, it's also doable. Yet, their mixed martini list looked disgusting. Then again, I don't do martinis. Nor do I throw down $11 on a mixed drink. But the real annoyance came from other patrons. From one guy in a hockey jersey throwing himself against the glass door (even hitting his head on the glass, when prompted) to a crazy D'Backs fan yelling in the face of a calm Braves supporter, those couple of guys just totally zapped the cool, calm and collected from J. Chew & Co. There's something defeating and sad about seeing another man yell "Lock it up!" at another man, during what could be a calm, mature discussion about two sports teams they individually love and follow. There's something even sadder about watching an aging man with a cigar hit on a married woman. He just wouldn't leave our group alone. Oh well...Maybe they won't be there when I go back... because I think if they are, I'm gonna have to say something. How obnoxious. If you're in Old Town and looking for a chill spot to hang, this is your place. Plus, I liked the music they had on rotation... From Modest Mouse and Postal Service to 90's grunge and alternative rock, I was diggin' the tunes, along with the laid back atmosphere, the great service and the knowledge that there was a chill place in Snottsdale to hang. Who knew?! I just don't think there's a strong enough draw to hang at this place all night. This is more of your "before dinner" or "before another bar" type of estabilshment. Only problem is there's not many other cool places in the area I'd be interested in going, especially on a Saturday night when Snottsdale is out in full force.~~#~0
Great selection, TONS of flavor, always hot and fresh, nice staff, great prices. In my top 3 quick restaurants.~~#~1
What a great property. Only had been to the bar years ago after the renovation, finally had a chance to stay in a Studio room this weekend. I was over the moon after this stay.I was looking for a nice weekend treat for me an my girlfriend. Vegas was tempting, but the drive eats up time I just don't have, and I don't gamble. For about the same as a discounted room at the Mirage and fuel expenses, I was able to get a gorgeous suite at the Valley Ho. Very fast, friendly check in. No lines, no bullshit resort fees and a personable guy behind the counter. Never get that in Vegas...Decor is startlingly unique. In a sea of cookie cutter mega resorts, a nice spin on hip, 1960's American style is a welcome change of pace. The details are like no other hotel I've stayed in, and the grounds are well landscaped and immaculate. It's quite humbling to think this place has seen patrons for 55 years. Studio Suite is super cool. Clean, good sized and hip. Tub in the center of the room was very, very cool, and was very useful. Good bed, good linens, great shower. Dug the little patio and the large sliding glass doors were awesome on a cool fall morning. Good colors, too. Only a few gripes; the bed side lamps are unusable with their super bright, nasty color temperature CFLs. Thankfully, there's lots of other mood lighting available. Also, the ceiling was starting to look a bit worse for wear, with some sagging at the joints and some water stains. Flat roofs always leak, though. In room music system ala Hard Rock would be a great addition, since TV is for the birds.  Location is unbeatable. A short walk to anything in Old Town, Fashion Square, nightclub block, etc. But far enough away from the bars that it's quiet at night. Found a great new restaurant (The House) on Main St. that I would have never stumbled across otherwise. Probably the only worthwhile, walkable district in Phoenix that never disappoints, and this hotel takes advantage of it. I will absolutely be back. Makes a great in town escape. Just wish I would have tried it out sooner!~~#~1
We have some friend who were RAVING about this place, so we popped in for a sandwich before a movie recently.  I gotta say, I had a great reuben sandwich that I was VERY pleased with.  I'm not sure if I will be venturing to the area just to have this sandwich again, but it was super tasty.  Everyone seemed to like what they had and the menu has something for everyone.  If I'm in the area again, I might venture here, but I am partial to Jimmy John's (next door) so it might be hard to choose.~~#~0
If you are writing poor reviews you obviously have not eaten Susie's Chile Verde con Carne.   I dream about it.  And I grew up in New Mexico!  The best  bowl of green chili stew or even better the green enchiladas with melt-in-your-mouth beef anywhere in town.  #13...don't forget the sour cream.   So you with the 2 & 3 stars go back and try the green chili and watch your stars become shooting stars!  I've never tried anything else there.  Why would you when you've found green chili heaven? Man, just talking about it makes me drool.  I'm headed out the door.....Susie's here I come!~~#~1
All I have to say is wow.  The auto picks and portrait pick that MelonFishPhoto did for me blew my mind.  I felt pretty confident after seeing some of the photos he had done, but my expectations were far exceeded.  He has a creative eye that caught much more than just the personality of the car.  The picture brought tons of people to my sites asking who shot the pics.  The portraits were truly great and fun to do.  I actually saw myself in a new light that I never saw before.  I loved it.  Anyone can take a picture, but very few people can take pictures that draw people in and seem to almost have an active emotion behind them.  I strongly recommend MelonFishPhoto to anyone for any photography need.~~#~1
Possibly the best burger I've ever had--definitely the best I've had in Phoenix.I get the classic, which comes on brioche with a choice of cheese. It's the only thing I've ever ordered there, because it's so damn good I can't pass it up. AND they get their beef from humanely raised, grass-fed cows. And beer selection, and the fries with aioli... Well, others here have told you how good they are.Pro tip? Throw a little of that aioli on your burger, too. Oh, and come hungry--it's a generously sized burger.It's a little pricey, but Delux is a really delicious treat.~~#~1
I'm a supporter of this store. At present, it leaves something to be desired, but we're starved for a place to shop on this side of town that has local and/or natural foods, so something is better than nothing! Also, I have faith that they will expand the available goods as time goes on. I'm excited to see how it develops.The good:  Great bread! This is the best part of this place thus far. The breads are fresh daily, baked locally, CHEAP ($1.79 per loaf for white, wheat, rye, marble ryle, onion, etc...), and all natural. And most importantly, they taste really good.  Picking up a loaf of the onion rye has already become a weekly ritual for me. They also have specialty pastries, tortillas, etc. Though I haven't tried those yet, they look good, and the prices are also very reasonable.The produce is also good. It's not a huge selection, but the prices are fair and the quality seems good. It's great to have locally grown items available nearby.Everyone who works there is super friendly, which is great, and they seem to be open long hours, which is really convenient.The down-side: As I said, very limited selection. The dry goods vary between local (mostly) and mass-produced (some random items). Some of the local artisan products look great, but they're very expensive. I think they'd be a little cheaper at an actual farmers' market (ie, where we're buying direct from the producer)--but I do plan to save up so I can try the pasta, etc.Weirdly, this place rounds out its selection of local/natural stuff with mass-produced crappy candy, ice cream bars, toilet paper, etc. I can't help but wish they'd found some greener alternatives. (Also-- Fiji Water? Come on, guys... That company is TERRIBLE. And the opposite of local. I don't get why they carry it.)SUMMARY: Overall, a great effort that I think will get better. In the meantime, get over there for your bread and veggies, stat.~~#~0
Amazing. Just stopped for snacks, had the fake crab rangoons and samosas. Very good. Will mos def come back to dine, hopefully several times, when in town. Love that they sell Diaya in the cooler and other lovely products, books and junk foods!~~#~1
this is perhaps the best italian food in Az. We have been going there for about 10 yrs and always recommend this place to all our clients. Best food, which is all homemade best service. This place never disappoints us. We recommend this place to our  clients and the feedback is thank you for the best food experience we have had.~~#~1
3.5 stars for me.  My first thought upon walking in was "wow, it's small."  Not a bad thing necessarily.  Could be a good thing in fact.I ordered a "Blushing Lady" cocktail (gin, Citronage, lemon juice, simple syrup, and a splash of sloe gin).  I'm pretty sure it was served in a dribble glass because I seemed to have difficulty actually consuming it.  But what I did have was perfect for me, and I would like another.I also opted for the special that evening which was a tenderloin sandwich with poblano, swiss, watercress, and charred onion.  While the poblano and onion sold me on it, I didn't quite get the swiss and watercress.  It was good, but could have been better with another cheese IMHO.  Also tried the herbed fries (delicious) and the mac 'n cheese (not as delicious).  The mac 'n cheese was good, but lacked the gooey cheesiness I crave.  We finished with warm doughnuts and salted butterscotch.  Doughnuts were fantastic, and it's hard not to like the butterscotch, but the "salted" part was missing.  A touch more please.I had kinda forgotten about The Grind, but now that I'm reminded of it, it's worth a second visit.~~#~0
I have been dining at this Indian restaurant for a few years now.  It was introduced to me by a close friend.  I have taken my co-workers, members of my ward, my mother and brothers and finally I get a chance to review it online.I don't mind going in for dinner, but the buffet is to die for.  Their consistency has never failed.  This place is great!~~#~1
While I like the food here, it seems like the service is just really hit and miss.  Just went a few nights ago, and after waiting 20 minutes for my food, I was informed they were out of what I ordered.  Then, they were out of forks and fortune cookies.  That being said, when they do have my order, the food is always fresh and flavorful.  The management seems to realize when there are issues, as they have provided free appetizers and such when we were unhappy.  Overall, a decent place, but might have to start trying other locations.~~#~0
lululemon is the best clothing store to hit Scottsdale since Ross. Even though exercise shorts there cost more than an evening in Tijuana they are worth every penny. So what if the pants there cost $160? They are awesome. Would Batman ever question Alfred about how much he paid for the Batmobile? No. Because the Batmobile is awesome and Batman would have paid any price for it. The men's side of the store doesn't carry a wide collection but what I did find was more magical than the sorting hat at Hogwarts. Everything is so comfortable and if you're overweight most of the pants and shorts have elastic so you don't look like a muffin when you put them on. I also like the workers there too. They are friendly and helpful and helped me understand that even if I liked some of the women's shirts there it would not be a good idea for me to purchase one and wear it. But I love teal I cried! If you haven't been to lululemon that probably means you hate small animals.~~#~1
OMG I love this place!!! Im from Canada and this is "continentally" good~~#~1
We (my husband, 2 friends and I) visited Tavola last night because of a Yelp review. We weren't as enthusiastic. The service was great! We ordered 2 pizza's and 2 salads. The salads were fresh, that was a nice surprise, not bagged. The pizza was good. Crust was a thicker than we like. Not a bad experience at all just not quite what we expected after the 5 stars.~~#~0
Why everyone in the valley doesn't use this service is beyond me.  They carry every quality pet food manufactured, their prices are competitive, they deliver...FREE... no matter how small the order...right to your door....what a deal. I've used Goober for a couple of years they have never missed a delivery, never been late.  Great customer service, and the ladies that answer the phone really know their stuff!  Have a pet with allergies... This is your place for quality pet food, they will aldo have lots a good suggestions on your pets diet.~~#~1
Had a friend invite/take me to lunch here at The Mission.  The physical place was great!  I had the arepas which were good, not great.  My friend had the tacos, which immediately upon being served them he realized he'd have to order something else (small portion).My portion for the arepas was plenty as the venezuelan sandwich itself is filling, but also came with a mix of regular and sweet potato fries, which were good.  Actually the ketchup/dipping sauce was awesome now that I think of it.Price -- hmm, a bit overpriced for lunch in my opinion, but I suppose that is Scottsdale.  That's really what was the difference between a 3 and 4 star for me here.~~#~0
Blue 32 wins my MVP award. I practically lived at this place during the Giants World Series run, and loved every moment of it! Despite the fact that I am still stuck in an orange and black-out World Series Championship daze (that will probably continue for at least another month or so), I must up the rating of this place to 5 stars because Blue 32 is now my favorite sports bar in all of Scottsdale. The service is top notch and the atmosphere is excellent for game watching.Here are the main two reasons why I will keep coming back here: 1. Food - This is the best bar food ever! You must try their onion rings, they are crazy delicious. Also if you aren't in the mood for fried food they have tons of healthy options as well. 2. TVs - Sports fans, it doesn't get much better than this when it comes to TVs. Outstanding visibility from every angle of the restaurant. No sports bar in Scottsdale can compete with Blue 32's TVs.Go here for a game and you won't be disappointed. I decked myself out in orange and black, screamed, jumped around with excitement and just all around enjoyed myself while hanging out in the bar area during the games. Overall, Blue 32 is a high quality sports bar and you've got to check this place out!P.S. GO GIANTS! =)~~#~1
Harvest hash is incredible - ask for their house made BBQ sauce on the side. Vegan raspberry banana bread French toast!!!  Sooooo good!It's a busy place on a Saturday morning but they work fast and everything runs smoothly.A gem!!!~~#~1
Ok, Stingray has it's high points. It's trendy, hip, and might just explode with young, beautiful people. The atmosphere and decor are nice, but that doesn't completely make up for the fact that the sushi simply falls around the mean. It's average. The menu has a nice selection of rolls and other dishes, and they're good, just not...great. We had a couple different specialty rolls, a tofu dish, soft shell crab, and tempura. Overall it was fresh and well-presented and halfway between actually authentic Japanese and some American Asian fusion food. The bar is crowded if you grab drinks while waiting and the bartenders weren't really fabulous in any way. Same goes for the servers who lack attentiveness and decorum in general. For a place with such a wait, huge crowds, and pretentious hostesses, I'd expect a little more. The curved booths along the sides are nice, though. Oh and, beware, in regards to the well-earned and deserved "scene": you might just see/run into every person you want (and don't want) to on a Saturday night.~~#~0
Banfield is okay for routine check ups for maintenance and preventive care. That is why they offer a "wellness plan". When it comes to your animal getting sick, I would go elsewhere. It should not be called a Hopital. The doctors are there for profit only and do not show any care for your pet. The vet techs care, but the doctors don't listen to them. This place is lacking ethics when it comes down to making important decisions when it comes to your pets health.~~#~1
For a pretty yuppie place, Desert Ridge has a decent enough assortment of shops, assuming of course you can find them.  Sure, you can theoretically pick up some new accents for your living room, a new pair of shoes, some books and the materials to make new candle rings in one go after which you involve yourself with movies and a beer, but you may give up in frustration before you ever find a place to park.I dearly hope whoever laid this place out is no longer in charge of such projects.  There is no logic whatsoever to the layout.  Trying to drive between the lots can verge on nightmarish.  Needlessly huge islands in the parking lot put leaves in the way of ever finding what's across the way, so navigating the place on foot is often out of the question without even taking the Phoenix summer heat and wretched drivers into consideration.Desert Ridge probably isn't going anywhere.  I've never been there that it wasn't busy.  It's almost impossible to avoid if you have any significant shopping to do.  But, the restaurants here don't tend to last long.  They come and go before Yelp can ever get to them, leaving an endless strand of big box outlets and bastions of poor fashion sense.~~#~0
First I will admit to not being a very impartial critic here-I absolutely adore a good bowl of ramen.  Although I've not been to Japan I've been fortunate enough to visit some outstanding ramen houses in Seattle, Honolulu, Los Angeles, Chicago, and San Jose.While I think this is probably some of the better ramen I've had in Arizona, unfortunately that's not really saying much.  It was okay, not great.I ordered the miso ramen with chashu hoping against hope that I'd have a reasonable facsimilie to Santouka's spicy miso available in the Mitsuwa stores around the country-drool.....  The noodles were decent, though I wish there was more of them.  The broth was not very miso-y and lacked the depth that really makes the ramen bowl.  The chashu was really the weak point, sliced thin pork with no real discernable chashu quality.  The accompanying vegetables were fine although I wouldn't say it's what I'm used to/looking for.In short I'd say this is Americanized ramen-and no, not the cheap junk from the package but suited more for an American palate instead of leaning toward authenticity.  No fish cake or bamboo shoots, none of the cloudy unctuous broth, no pork belly chashu.The place looks great and the staff is great, I wouldn't dismiss it but Republic doesn't get a fervent recommendation either.~~#~0
Every time I go into this place its with good times and cheery mates and I leave the wiser with a pint of fresh brew and some of the best food. To make a great date, go to the Phoenix Rock Gym first and then climb the ladder on the back wall and walk in around the back...Great times for every one!~~#~1
I am from Chicago - and the italian beef here really is perfection.  Add to that the friendliest people ever and the amazing hotziki with fries- and they've got me forever.  Their falafel wrap is insanely good and the patty melt is to die for.  I could eat here every day - and I practically do!~~#~1
Super friendly. Joe was there greeting everyone, refilling coffee, and sharing how we uses local Arizona suppliers. Great diner food and decor. Loved the biscuits and chorizo gravy.  Will definitely be back.~~#~1
1st off I just want to say that i do actually think the food here is pretty good tasting, regardless of how brown the guac looks.  My problem is the service, everyone who works here is either lazy, dumb or a combo of both.  At Subway they at least pretend to be helpful, here they ask you the same questions over and over (ex. I have been asked what toppings 4 times and I only had 3 things added so really...) and still mess up.  One particular time my friend got a roast beef sandwich and half was roast beef half was pastrami, how is that even possible!?  Either way if they dont shape up they should change their name to Port Hole because its run by a bunch of As*holes.~~#~0
Stopped in here for lunch the other day.  I ordered the Marzen barbecue chicken sandwich with garlic fries.  The sauce on the sandwich was good but the chicken breast was pretty tasteless.  The garlic fries were a winner!Service at the bar was fast and friendly.  It was nice to have a TV to watch as I ate lunch.~~#~0
marginal sushi meets uncomfotable seating.  we used restaurant.com coupon and got stuck wtih an 18% tip...with no service, seriously???  felt scammed...think we actually spent more based on that tip than had we just paid full price.  avoid this one, just not worth it.~~#~1
My favorite Mexican food.  THE BEST BEAN BURRO ENCHILADA STYLE IN THE WORLD (yes I've tried them all)  Get the red enchilada sauce, and a tortilla on the side.~~#~1
Fuego Bistro has quickly become one of my wife and I's favorite restaurants!  We went with a large group the first time and they were great about us having 7, including two smaller children.  Last night my wife and I went back for a date night and had the most wonderful time!  Jeff, the owner, is fantastic and always wants to make sure you have a great time.  The sommelier was also great.  He talked to us about the wine, gave us some tips for pairings, and even had us take a sip of wine while chewing our food.  It totally changed the character of both the wine and food.Speaking of the food, the short ribs are amazing!  The best sides we've had are the creamed corn and the chipotle mashed potatoes, but the maple chili carrots and the cornbread green chili casserole are also very good!The cocktails are great and the happy hour menu is pretty reasonable.We will definitely be going to Fuego on a regular basis!!~~#~1
So I knew ahead of time about the wait. So we got there at 3:30 and waited for an hour and a half until they opened. But we were able to be seated as soon as they opened.Let me just say that I've never had anything even close to the kind of pizza that we got. It's outstanding! I highly recommend the caprese salad, antipasto and the rosa pizza. Though I'm pretty sure that it's all amazing, no matter what you get.~~#~1
Haven't been to a Chili's in FOREVER but those darn gift cards get me every time. Stopped by today for dinner and we ordered the 2 for 20 special (an app and 2 entrees). The food was alright-we ordered the Spicy Chicken Fajitas, the Bacon Chicken Quesadilla and started off with the Onion and Jalapeno Stack. The jalapenos were lame but everything else tasted great after a long day at work.What was not so great was the service. Two waiters introduced themselves (I figured one was training) but neither bothered to stop by and fill up our drinks or really check in. The girl who served us seemed to spend most of her time on the other side of the dining room and the teen host actually ended up being the one to refill my Strawberry Lemonade. So thanks to the young dude manning the desk and NOT my slow waiterS.~~#~0
Love my Chick-fil-a!  Wow, they have a system and it is super fast in the drive thur.  Amazed and they are always super friendly!  They always get the order right!!!  ++++~~#~1
DO NOT GO HERE.  One of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had.  The setup is a little like "Pei Wei" where they take your order, give you a number, and bring the food to your table.  Placed our order, and had to stalk other tables and hover over people eating trying to wait to get a table.  Waited a long time, all the while others who ordered after us found seats and got their food before us. Servers kept bringing my food to me since it was ready, but I still didn't have a table, so they kept saying they would "put it under the heat lamp" for me.  Finally eventually found a table, and then kept waiting and waiting for our food, which the manager claimed "he had them remake" since it was getting cold.  My food came, and it was cold and disgusting.  We had to get going since we were going to a show, and my mom's food still wasn't there.  The staff asked to see her receipt, since they couldn't find her order.  She went up to the manager and said she just wanted her money back since we had to go (it had been 45 minutes since we placed our order).  He said her food would not be ready for a while, and gave her some cash, and we left.  My mom never even ate, and my food was horrible.  I would NOT recommend this place, it's awful.~~#~1
Excellent~~#~1
Seriously, if you're looking for a place to get your knives sharpened or buy some cool professional kitchen gear, look no further.~~#~1
Of course it gets hot in the summer. You're going to be watching bands in a basement with a bunch of people and depending on when / what's going on there might be some idiots 'mawshing'. Sound quality is great for the size. Glad they reopened one of my favorite venues. and YES everybody has gotten lost the first time they tried to find the Nile. The main & front room have shows as well.~~#~1
Sports Authority is like the Walmart of sporting goods stores. No, wait, that would be Big 5. I guess they are more like Target. Reasonable prices, and products that don't completely fall apart the first time you use them (but they are still made in China) and no service whatsoever. And Dick's is more like a Dillard's or Macy's because they have the higher end brands and employees that are older than 16 or 17 years old. So then I guess Bass and Cabela's would be more like Nordstrom's? That's where the really nice stuff is but you usually walk out without purchasing anything unless they are having a sale. Except Cabela's is sort of specialized so I think that would be more analogous to something like an Ann Taylor.Ok, I know I have gone way off topic here but I think I have made it abundantly clear that I am not a regular customer. But I do occasionally come in to buy gifts for family and friends. On my most recent visit, I came in, wandered around for about 20 minutes and then found what I needed (with no help whatsoever from staff), paid and left. A two star experience for sure but I have to give them an extra one since they offer a discount when you check in thru the Yelp app on your smart phone and so that saved me 10 bucks.~~#~0
5 BIG STARSFor service and quality of meal, restaurants really don't get any better than this. Multiple servers, dressed in NY black are constantly there for you.This restaurant prides itself in using local products & blending them into traditional meals, ala Alice Waters, and they do an excellent job.For starters, we had (are you ready?):-"Macerated Local Vine Ripened Heirloom Tomatoes, Fossil Creek Goat Cheese & Mascarpone Tart," including Buckwheat & Saguaro Seed Tart, Basil foamed from the garden, Black Ice, and Gila River Olive Oil; and-"Pan Flashed White & Green Asparagus with Chanterelles & Cholla Buds," including Chanterelle Mushroom Fondue, Desert Quail Egg (sunny side up), Red Currents and Aged Sherry.And that was just the beginning! For dinner we had:-"Veal Ribeye Rubbed with Sandalwood, Dry Mole & Green Chile Sand," including Mesquite Cooked Desert Fruit Chutney, Truffle Frites, and Rutabaga Cobbler; and-"Local Pecan Crusted Colorado Lamb with Native Seeds SEARCH Mole," including Pastry Tapenade of Fennel, QC Olives, Eggplant, Wild Mushrooms, Heirloom Tomatoes & Iitoi Onions.Everything was exquisite!This meal was to die for!Any complaints at all? Well, yes, but very minor. This place is actually in a Sheraton, but I guess that insures a good stream of patrons that can afford such meals.And the decor? Not very good. It needs a serious MAKEOVER.  Wall-hangings, window treatments & carpeting aren't much.So there you are...~~#~1
Gymboree, many years ago I brought my first son to Gymboree quite often and really enjoyed.  Never thought I would be back, but now we have another gymboree tike and he loves it.  I am very happy to have been reintroduced to Gymboree and have already made plans to go again with my son next week.  The instructor made it look easy and really communicated very well with both parents and children. Thinking about Gymboree now, my only regret is that I know someday my boy is going to outgrow it, and I want these times to last forever.~~#~1
Honestly, I can't remember how I found out about Butter & Me, but I'm glad it happened.My fiancee (now wife!) and I are addicted to cupcakes and we decided to swap the traditional wedding cake for some delicious cupcakes. Kelly at Butter & Me did not disappoint. She was absolutely fantastic to work with and has *the best* cupcakes in the valley! Believe me, we taste-tested a number of other vendors and everyone else's cupcakes tasted like small, dry, cakes.The cupcakes from Butter & Me were exactly what we were looking for. They were perfectly moist, beautifully decorated, and there are a ton of delicious flavors to choose from!!!I cannot recommend Butter & Me highly enough! The Yelp review sums it up: "Woohoo! As good as it gets!"~~#~1
Bookmans is Great!  They probably don't need another positive review but so what.  I use Bookmans for recycling books I've read and for buying used books for myself.  All I can say is that I like everything about the way they do business.  They have great people working there.  The store vibe is very positive.  Their prices are very fair and what they pay for your used books is incredibly fair, plus you know that you've made a positive contribution to our society by recycling books that others can enjoy.  Do yourself a favor and stop in.  Enjoy!~~#~1
Outstanding customer service!!! Great camping firewood bags!!! HUGE bags of high quality, long burning wood for $10!! Cannot be beat!!!Cash, check or use the ATM they have in the office ($2 fee).http://www.bbfw.com/~~#~1
Sol Mexican Cocina just opened this week, so I'll take that into Consideration. Beautiful place, but give this place time to get there Act together. Checked in with the Hostess and was told 55 Minute Wait. Ok, found 2 Seats at the Bar and that was a very Positive Experience. Stacey our Bartender. was Terrific, she did everything perfect & the Drinks were Great. We ordered Guacamole and it was the Best I Have ever had in a Restaurant. Was followed by a Carne Burritto which came Cold & Was Comped.After sitting at the Bar for over an Hour we were never Told a Table was ready. The Hostesses are very Weak and need Much More training. My Suggestion is hire Older More Skilled, Expereinced Girls. who Know how to Manage the Crowd.The Place was Extremely Busy and Should do well and will Definitely give it another Try.~~#~0
I LOVE THIS PLACE! It's so nice to be able to eat here whenever it's chilly outside. Actually, allow me to be honest, I probably would eat here everyday but I settle for 1-2 times a week.I get my Pho with extra meatballs and no onions and they make it perfect for me each time!!! The folks are awesome and no matter how busy it is everything come out SUPER fast! You know a girl loves to eat in a timely manner with my hectic schedule!The Springrolls, the crab puffs the chicken fried rice all amazing too! For a good time time and warm feeling after a FANTASTIC meal this is the best come winter or AZ summer time:)~~#~1
Just isn't very good.I don't understand why people give this place even three stars.  It's rare for me to give a place a low rating, but, My Big Fat Greek restaurant is nothing but gimmick anymore and has gone from bad to worse.   The food is not even close to any representation of what good Greek food tastes like.I've been to this place several times over the years.  This location and others.   It used to be just on the lower end of OK...  it's never been as good as you can get from a 'Ma and 'Pa place.  However, we went for lunch the other day and it's just gotten to the point I wouldn't even go back for a quick bite.We ordered the garlic hummus, and it was overly full of garlic and not home made.  It seemed to be loaded with garlic powder, as opposed to fresh hummus that just had roasted garlic in it.   The olives we ordered were rough at best.  UGH even thinking about them.  Overly seasoned and not very fresh.   The rice was over cooked and was so soft it lacked any sort of texture.The first rule of good let, alone great food, is FRESH.   This place needs a rescue.Less critical, but, I think an overall representation of what has happened to the place, the menu's were totally trashed.   As in ratty, tattered, and dirty.  The lamination was coming off them and they were dirty. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere.~~#~1
Good Indian food not great.  Came in on a Saturday night, was craving Indian.  Not busy at all.  (Never a great sign).  The samosas were the best in town, piping hot with a great filling that was redolent of spicies and not super mild like some other restaurants.  The lamb korma and chicken tikka masala were okay.  For some reason it didn't pop for me.  It had nothing to do with the spiciness level, it was just missing that extra pop you get from a truly great curry.  I don't know if the spices hadn't been freshly toasted, or if it was lacking a crucial pinch of love that day, but I wasn't feeling it.  I left full but not quite satiated of my Indian food fix.  And the quest for the best chicken tikka masala in town continues....(oh I should mention the interior of the restaurant is beautiful, the service good, but the prices a little steep for my taste)~~#~0
I was visiting Tempe for Ironman Arizona and came down with pretty acute foot injury three days prior to the race.  The friendly receptionist at Dr. Natcher's office understood the predicament I was in and managed to fit me into Dr. Natcher's schedule within a couple hours of my call.  Dr. Natcher's is clearly both a great doctor and a great person; she is extremely competent, friendly, and sympathetic.  As an  runner and cyclist, she is also in tune with sports injuries and the mentality of an athlete. She quickly diagnosed the injury and prescribed an aggressive treatment protocol.  I was in good shape on race day (due to her treatment protocol) and am so very thankful to Dr. Natcher for putting me in the position to complete the race in fine fashion.  I was paying out-of-pocket, and  was very pleasantly surprised by the cost of the office visit.  I can't speak highly enough of my experience with Dr. Natcher.~~#~1
My first visit to Sweet Republic and when I was done my first thought was, "why did I take so long to come here!?"I sampled a few of their ice creams and let me tell you.  All delicious.  In particular the mint chip ice cream was delicious.  It tastes like fresh mint because get this... it is!Service was quick and friendly.  We got in right before a rush and let me tell you, the staff were able to handle it like pros.Each of their ice creams are homemade and you can just taste the love mixed into each one.  You can tell how proud they are of their creations.  I wont go into the kinds of ice cream they have but can tell you that whatever you choose, you will love.Stop on down, took me 30 minutes to get there from Gilbert, and enjoy a cone or cup.  Do yourself a favor and don't delay for 3 years like I did!~~#~1
We were craving Mexican food and since we were in the area I decided to check on my trusty yelp app on my phone to find a perfect food joint to check out.  Sure enough, it came through for us and told us about this little gem tucked away in an area I had been several times but had never noticed it before.  I am so very glad I tried it as it will now be my go-to place for Mexican food.  The food is delicious and fresh and reasonably priced.  The guacamole is a must try and the carne asada is so good.  If you're in the mood for Mexican and in the area, I would definitely recommend this place.~~#~1
This place is one of my favorite burger joints.  If you really appreciate a good burger, I don't think you'll be disappointed.  Kobe burger, Double truffle fries, Creme Brulee Shake and just pure joy.  First time, the burger was slightly over cooked for medium rare; but ever since I have been back multiple times and it's been prepared perfectly to my expectations.  I do believe in second chances and they won me over.  I don't get the mushroom on the Kobe; Meat is very tasty and flavorful, no need to add any toppings.  The Samburger and Zinburger are very tasty as well.  Last time I added bacon to the Zinburger, very good, and I do recommend that.  The staff are very attentive to diners needs.  I have tried a few of the Fox-RC and every time has been an excellent experience so far.  (I hope it won't change).  SF definitely has a unique and entrepreneurial vision in food industry which has, and will make him very successful.~~#~1
Seriously soo good! Drove 60miles to come here about 5 times in the 3 months that I lived in AZ. I came here because of the triple D episode and it was soo worth it! Burgers, fries, onion rings, sweet potatoe fries and pizza are ALL GOOD! and check out their bathrooms.. its pretty cool too. Tried Joe's Real BBQ, which is their first restaurant but it was just OK. Joe's Farm grill is def. one of my fav places..~~#~1
Not the best burger I've ever had, but a fun place to try with the coworkers on a Friday afternoon. I had the quadruple bypass and a few helpings from the all-you-can-eat fry station. Better than BK/McD's, but nothing to write home about. The waitresses were hot and they happily wheeled me out to my car in a wheelchair! But it's more of an attraction than anything else.~~#~0
This place is awesome and it replaced Trader Joes as my new grocery store. The produce is plentiful and fresh, they have Boars Head at the deli, and they have organic options. The meat is way more reasonably priced than AJs. It reminds me of a small Whole Foods without the ridiculous prices.~~#~1
This was the first and only Thai place I've been to in AZ.  Overall, it is pretty good.  I think we will probably try a new place next time but if we can't find anything better, I think we won't have any problem going back to Swaddee.*Price = on the high-end *Pad Thai = pretty good volume*Green Curry = very good.*Garlic delight = The portion is way too small to charge $11~~#~0
This is Mesa's best breakfast, hands down! This is one of my family's favorite Saturday/Sunday brunch places in the valley. Crackers & Co. is great food at great prices and we always take out-of-town guests there when visiting!I was never a fan of eggs unless they were scrambled or in an omelette, but Crackers showed me the way to delicious fried and poached eggs!  The Eggs Benny is great, both Traditional and California-style. Their omelettes are huge and never overcooked (my fave: Spinach Mushroom) . The skillets are mighty tasty and really satisfying (my fave: The Vatican with eggs over easy). Try their French toast... it's got great flavor and is delightfully crispy. If you get a chance, try lunch there! Their soups are so scrumptious and the sandwiches are to die for! The Cream of Spinach and Artichoke soup tastes just like a bowl of spinach and artichoke dip, and they don't skimp on the artichokes at all! The Chicken Dumpling soup is seriously the best I've ever had (I'm not even a fan of dumplings!)! The Roma Tomato Chicken Melt is my favorite sandwich on the menu (such good flavor!), followed closely by the Drunken Chicken sandwich. Their burgers are quite good and along with their salads, they serve up a hefty portion!Beware though of 30 to 45 minute wait times on the weekends in the winter due to snowbirds flocking for breakfast. The wait times let up about 12:30P though, so it's great for those who can't decide between breakfast or lunch!~~#~1
The festival seemed a little smaller than what I expected, and I didn't find a lot to peruse when not looking at various food booths.  They had a lot of local Japanese restaurants selling food, such as Nagasaki Grill, Paradise bbq, and Arai Pastry, which was nice but I am close enough to all those restaurants that I could just buy their selections any time at their restaurants.  I think I've been too spoiled by the Japanese festivals in San Francisco, since the food selection here was more limited and there wasn't as many booths to buy things from.  I did like the cultural shows, such as the taiko and the martial arts demonstrations, and the shaded area with the bonsai and akitas was nice.  I think in general though, if you don't live close to Japanese restaurants or haven't had a lot of immersion into Japanese culture, this is a good way to introduce yourself to it here in Arizona.~~#~0
FEZ for brunch on Saturday with a bunch of girlfriends was one of the highlights of my weekend. Several of us ordered the FEZ Fritatta and it was perfectly cooked with tasty toppings and the best bacon on the side. I also sampled the sweet potato fries and they were even better than anticipated--a standout.Plates looked pretty. C'mon, that's important! Presentation, people. Service was superb.Hadn't been to FEZ in a while and forgot how delicious it is! Let's go to FEZ more often, girls!~~#~1
This review is for the JCPenny portrait studio responsible for the "Christmas Blessings" Christmas card that graced my family's and co-worker's mailboxes this past holiday season.     My girlfriend and I were going for a "Step Brothers" pose so we had to look the part. I guess the look won't be in any Vogue or GQ magazine this year. No, you'll have to go back to the time when Circus Magazine was popular and when mom and dad went to key parties.         Our photographer was wonderful. She seemed to enjoy her job and have fun with client's ideas. However the person who helped us pick out which cards to choose was not having any of it. If you looked up awkward in the dictionary and smacked them upside the head that's what it felt like. Her sheer agony of working there oozed out from her forced smile.    Anyways, I'll just say that I am damn happy I had a coupon for a $30 package which included two 8x10s of different poses and a whompin' helping of greeting cards. A package that retails at about $170.    And no, even if you pay that price,  a happy ending is not included.~~#~0
I love this theater!! it's 100 % digital and very clean and the staff is friendly. I believe that the have child care if you have any. also lot's of great restaurants and shopping all within walking distance in the shops @ Norterra.~~#~1
We-Ko-Pa has been prominently listed as one of the places to play if you are in Arizona.  I first played it several years ago, and it has become one of my favorite desert courses in Arizona.   There are two courses - Cholla, and Saguaro, and although they are both desert courses, they are somewhat different. The cholla course is an older, more mature course and doesn't have the same feel as the Saguaro course.  The Saguaro course can be walked, but has a wild side to it and to me, seems to have more elevation changes. That said, both courses are immaculate, wonderful condition, and a joy to play.Over the years, I have played the Saguaro course more, but lately the Cholla course has grown on me.  Now when my golfing buddies come down, I always make it a point to play both courses with them.  This has led to some interesting memories.  The first time we played, despite my warnings, one of the players wandered off the Saguaro course and found a Jumping Cholla.  He liked it so much, he brought it back to us - stuck all down one side of his body.  It took us quite a while to get them off of him - and then he wanted us to give him extra strokes. Not a chance.Another time, one of my friends teed off on a par 3 on the Cholla course, and hit it into a dry creek bed. He seemed to lose his composure, and hit five provisionals, which also went into the desert. Then he found his first ball, and ended up with a par!!  Of course, we haven't let him forget the five provisionals...I have read some comments about the marshals on the course, and in the past would agree. However, the last two times we played, the marshals have been very good - very courteous and very helpful.  The last time, while we were playing cart path only, one of the players was very slow (as usual) and the female marshal most diplomatically asked us to speed up.  She was one of the nicest, most courteous marshals I have had experience with, and consequently, one of the most effective.The courses have a nice driving range, chipping and sand area, and putting greens. Unfortunately, they no longer allow you to use them, unless you are playing one of the courses (you used to be able to pay a daily fee to use them).Finally, the service is friendly and courteous - from the drop off, to the restaurant, to the desk personnel, I have had nothing but pleasant experiences with the employees.I think any golfer should experience these courses at least once - a visit would be well worth it.~~#~1
Haus Murphy's is fabulous in so many ways that I can really only hit the highlights here. Even if German food isn't your favorite (I dislike saurkraut and cabbage), the service and food is great.The service was wonderful. I was almost 2 hours earlier than my friends, so I used a table in the bier garden to do some work on my computer (with my own mobile hotspot. . . Haus Murphy's does not have wi-fi). The entire staff made me feel welcome as a sipped a wonderful German beer and did some work.My friends showed up, we had great dinners, and then we continued on to Glendale Glitters. If I'm able to make it over to Glendale from my home in Mesa for Glendale Glows in January, I will certainly stop in Haus Murphy's. Authentic German or not (I've never been to Germany, my friends of mine who have seemed to really enjoy the food too), this place is worth the visit. Enjoy!~~#~1
This has to be the best Thai food around. I have tried a few other places, but none are as authentic and delicious as Swaddee. We are now regulars and have never been disappointed.~~#~1
Slow, unorganized and filled to the brim with crazy people. I prefer to do everything through the service arizona website but recently got a letter that I needed to get a new license because my picture was going to expire. It makes total sense that my license is valid until I'm 65 but the picture expires after 11 years. Of course, the state charges a nominal fee of $12 to replace it. If the state of AZ was in need of my money I'd gladly just give it to them if it means avoiding this nightmare. Oh, and the camera is set to fat...~~#~1

Best in south chandler.  Glad they are out here~~#~1
What a find.  In a strip mall nestled between a bank, clothing stores and overnight shipping is Giuseppe's.  A family owned and run establishment where byob is the way to go.  This reminds me of countless small mom and pop's back in The City.  The staff is friendly, the portions sizable and the check small to medium.  In fact, I can't believe I haven't reviewed this restaurant before.  Whether on a date, or with the family, I've never had a bad experience in the dozens of times I've been there.  From the veal parmagian (sp?) to the eggplant, from the fettucine to the spaghetti and meatbeals... mama mia.  It is a small venue, with very limited outdoors seating during good weather.  And the locals know about it, so it gets pretty packed Thursday through Sunday.  The salads and appetizers are delicious as well... If this restaurant had been in Spinal Tap, it would get "an eleven"...~~#~1
I've been coming to Yusefs now for awhile to get gyro meat to go, along with their fresh feta, pitas and cucumber yogurt. BEST I'VE HAD! Finally I was able to eat there as they have a kitchen and OMG, it was delis and the prices are fabulous. I ordered the lentil soup and holy cow, it was UNREAL! I got the gyro plate with gyro meat and fresh rice (basmati?) and it was fabulous. Gyro Greek salad was amazing too. I love coming here because the owner is nice and very sweet!!!!!I recommend you try this little gem!! It's worth the drive!~~#~1
Maybe I expected too much. The silverware was plastic. The plates were plastic. I felt like I was at a cookout.~~#~0
Met up with a group of friends here on a Monday night... a big group. Although Keegan's had no notice of our mob arrival they did well with service etc. Beers were poured fast; food took a little extra time but with a group our size that is to be expected. The outside patio space was great on a warm AZ night... a friend got the sliders and said they were quite tasty when they finally arrived. The happy hour prices are okay with a nice choice of beers and mixed cocktails.~~#~0
Not many places that you can go and get a natural casing charred white hot dog outside of western NY.Folks I know from Western NY love this place, and I have to agree (even though I'll still take a good Chicago dog any day).I know where I'll be going if I ever have an itch for a white hot. :)~~#~1
I love everything about Oregano's!  My first experience was in Flagstaff with a location being right off NAU's campus, and I was thrilled more started to open up in the valley.  There is one in Mesa, now, very close to me, and the ambiance remains the same.  I love the vintage decoration, the music, usually Ella Fitzgerald and other jazz icons, and the FOOD!  All the appetizers are amazing, especially the Boom Dip.  My favorite pizza is the O-Riva.  And passing up the Pizzookie (pizza cookie) is out of the question, get your friends to dive into this amazing desert.  Also the bellinis are outstanding!  Enjoy your experience here, you will fall in love! Have patience at the smaller locations, usually there will be a wait.~~#~1
The service level and attitude of the staff was diabolical, they demonstrated absolutely no interest in our business. Ever since moving to the new premises, things have sucked. I shall not be wasting any more of my time or money here.~~#~1
Good food, but I don't care for the SUPER FAST waitstaff. Fast is one thing, but walking away while I am still trying to order is RUDE.~~#~0
best place in scottsdale to watch a game. Great food (greasy, but what bar food isn't?), great drink specials, and an even better atmosphere. The owner came by and greeted us and made us feel very welcome. I will definitely return in the future.~~#~1
I've been to Milano's Music several times and each experience is worse than the first time.  I look at the reviews of people I actually know and realize that each experience is different.  On the biggest day of the year for Small Business owners who should be reaching out to the customers and gladly sell them the smallest items Milano misses that point, by miles.  My husband is re-learning to play the drums and needed a drummer's throne and since it was November 24th and "Small Business Saturday" I thought "why not give them another try", guess what we walked out with Nothing they lost potential set of drum customer  ( those can cost anywhere from a few $100 to $1k ).  I won't go back in there.  The guy that is in charge of the drum section is rude and pompous and walked away from us TWICE.  The second time was enough to make my blood boil.  We found a throne in another section that my husband liked and I said let's get it.  The guy came over and said "Oh, I have another one in the box" and grabbed the one in my husband hands and walked off never to be seen again.  We waited and waited at the checkout counter for him to show up, he never did because he had decided to help another couple.  I looked at the cashier and my husband and said "NOT cool at all" and my husband set all the other items he was going to purchase down and said we won't be purchasing anything.  I felt bad for the guy at the register because it wasn't his fault and he apologized but that doesn't give the guy running a section the right to decide what customer is more important and that is what he did.  New customers should never be treated any differently and to basically make a statement of you are not important enough was the final straw.  I grew up around Milano's music stores they were the first  to give me guitar lessons and it is sad to see this happy.  Besides this Yelp review , I plan to write their the store personally.  When small businesses are struggling and this kind of thing happens  a person begins to understand why more people shop with a big box store and less and less from Mom and pop stores.~~#~1
I have been a "regular" customer at this salon ever since it opened.  At first it was great!  Clean, relaxing, and welcoming.   After a few months without a manicure or pedicure I decide to treat myself to a manicure this past week.  I went in and a lady did a beautiful job on my gel manicure.  She paid attention to detail and didn't rush through the whole process.  I didn't have time to get a pedicure so I decided to come back the next day.  I only wish that I had her do my pedicure yesterday ... The guy who did my pedicure had some sort of infection on his thumb.  I didn't notice it at first because he was using gloves but when it was time for the foot massage he took his gloves off, revealing it.  Tracy was doing someone else's nails right in front of me and clearly saw that he had some sort of sore or fungus on his nail.  It was completely black and it looked like something was growing out of it.    I was shocked that she didn't tell him to at least put his gloves back on.  The "massage" that he gave me was hardly any massage at all.  He did the same motion over and over while concentrating on the tv.  Definitely not worth the $25.   The worst part is that he gave me an ingrown toe nail.  The whole right side of my nail is swollen and I just hope that I don't get an infection.  This was by far the worst pedicure that I have ever received. Even though I had a great gel manicure here, my last experience was so horrible that I will not be back.~~#~1
I'm addicted! Everyone there is so freakin nice. And Maui dogs are delicious.~~#~1
Anything with the word "Original" in that name always makes me wonder, for real? This place is for real. It is very close to the new house and I met the 'rents there for a burger the other night and to watch the Giants beat the '9ers. I immediately felt a sense of familiarity when I walked in the door, I hadn't remembered being there before until I walked in. But it all came back to me very quickly. I remember stopping by here years ago with friend before heading to the Fair one year. It was just as good as I remember it. It is an old fashioned burger join. You can either walk up and order then take your food to your table, or if you are on the bar side you can order from the bartender, who is very attentive, even with a full bar and restaurant. Once you get your burger or sandwich, you go to the fixin's bar, load up on toppings and veggies then sit back down to enjoy! They also have some great sides and aps, fried mushrooms, onion rings, zucchini and fries. They fries are OK, a little over done for my taste but everything else was great. This is a great place to make a regular stop on your weekly happy hour agenda, to watch a sports game (tons of TVs on the bar side) or to fix your burger cravings.~~#~0
While the idea is not new - an updated outdoor shopping center that mimics a European outdoor shopping and residential district, Kierland Commons is similar to West Village in Dallas, TX or Santana Row in Santa Clara, CA, however, in the Scottsdale version, it is completely stripped of any personality and design, perhaps to better blend in with the desert environment.The usual suburban chain stores can be found at this shopping center, ranging from Smith and Hawken, Banana Republic, Barnes & Noble and the like, though there are a select few independent retailers which make a trip to this center a little more interesting.  Parking can be difficult, however, there are lots that line the backside of the center as well as valet parking across from the center park.  People watching is quite entertaining, from the kiddies that frolick in the fountains, to Barbie's desert siblings.The independent dining options are a little more interesting, such as The Green House and Zinc Bistro, though again, the usual unimaginative chains are represented here, including PF Chang's and The Cheesecake Factory.  While I don't find most of the retail offerings at Kierland Commons to be particularly compelling to make multiple repeat visits, I will return for the more independent dining options.~~#~0
We attended this restaurant for an early seating at 5 p.m. and were immediately impressed with the atmosphere and professional staff.   Both were first class.We decided to sit at the counter overlooking the chefs preparing the food and we were glad we did.  One young fellow was more than happy to answer any questions we had regarding the preparation as well as the presentation of the food.  It really was fun to watch the whole process.We decided to go straight to the entree instead of filling up on an appetizer beforehand and we were glad we chose to do that.  We each ordered the Kobe Vaca Encebollada, which was a grilled Kobe skirt steak nestled on a bed of caramelized onions.  Alongside the steak were three slices of potato about a half inch thick and these were topped with a guacamole type mixture as well as other toppings.  They were absolutely delicious and I was so sad to reach the end of those.  The steak was cooked to absolute perfection and I was determined to clean my plate because it, too, was just so scrumptious!  It was a very ample portion and we did clean our plates and definitely had no room for dessert, unfortunately.  As our cocktail, we followed another reviewers lead and ordered virgin mojitos, which were $9.50/ea and they were delicious and also sufficed as a dessert stand-in so the tab wasn't too crazy at all.  Well worth it for that delicious steak.We did dress up for the occasion and were glad we did as everyone was dressed casually but nice.  It's fun to have the whole experience for a special night out.  We look forward to returning soon.~~#~1
Yes, this is an awesome toy store.  Huge selection and a friendly knowledgeable staff.  But the prices... Yikes! I really can appreciate the fact that these are wholesome, well-made toys with a focus on learning rather than supporting the corporate brands and Hollywood characters.  But it is just not practical for your everyday shopping needs.  I recommend it when you want a special or unusual gift or if you have one of those rare children that wants intellectual stimulation more than to impress their friends with the latest electronic gadget or action figure.~~#~0
We were driving around Chandler area to find a decent place to eat and Mido Sushi caught our attention. "Oh, Okay!" - I thought and walked right in. We were greeted right away with a good waitress, but somehow I found her voice was really annoying!The food came out after 10minutes and I was disappointed with the sashimi! It wasn't as fresh as I expected. The soy sauce tasted very weird and too salty. By far this is not the most decent sushi restaurant I've experienced. Kabuki and Masa sushi are still my best choice so far.~~#~1
A OK.  I have been here atleast a dozen times.  Beer is always great.  Food is pretty good, although the salmon BLT was super dry last visit.  Going there with a large party, 9, with out of town family proved to be very bad.  Told us 20 minutes to wait and ended up being over an hour.  Some of the party went home because it took so long which was embarassing to me as I wanted them to have a good dinner.  Next time I will come with a small party.  If there is a next time.  Bummer.~~#~0
This place is as good as it gets for shooting.   I became a full member today after also researching Shooter's World, Phoenix Rod & Gun, and Scottsdale Gun Club (where I will also become a member).   The cost is VERY reasonable at $85/year ($110 after adding the initial administrative fee).The club is huge (140 acres).   There is a main range for members and the public.  Then, there are multiple other shooting areas for members only.   You can shoot out to 500 yards at this facility AND you can shoot any weapon.   The only restrictions appear to be on the allowable ammo.  I'm really looking forward to shooting at this club next weekend.~~#~1
07/25/11I have a new crush... and it's Christopher's Restaurant's pizza!  I've been holding onto a restaurant.com gift certificate I'd purchased to use at Crush Lounge for a long time now and decided it was time to use it.  I arrived w/ high expectations, of both the ambience and the food, and I wasn't disappointed... much.  The service was a bit spotty at times- we were immediately greeted when we entered and were seated quickly, but the wait that came after water delivery was a bit long at a time when there were no other guests seated around us.  (Perhaps there were other guests seated elsewhere, but they weren't seated at the lounge, at the food bar, nor outside... Indeed, it seemed like were were the only ones in the room, besides the cooks at the open kitchen area, the servers, and the bartenders.)  Bread was delivered, but we were each given only one one-inch slice of a baguette.  How strange, especially when the butter cup held enough butter to spread over a whole loaf!  Whatever...  Two of the three dinner specials were relayed to us, w/ the promise of coming back to tell me about the scallop dish, but when our server finally came back ten or so minutes later, he asked if we were ready to order, so I had to remind him about the scallop entree... What was in it, and how was it prepared, and how much?  Hmmm, maybe he was ready to go home...Came in w/ Mom, so we had to try the calamari.  I also chose the Duck confit, goat cheese, and fig pizza.  For dessert, we had the profiteroles.  I really liked the calamari's coating-- lightly battered and fried golden-brown.  My fave pieces of the squid are also my Mom's fave, the tentacles, so these were soon finished.  At least half of the remaining pieces, the sliced bodies, were undercooked-- poor value for the $12 menu price tag (and I was charged $13 on the ticket).  The pizza* was TERRIFIC!  Loved the semolina thin crust, and the duck confit gave the entree a great smoky flavor-- I thought perhaps there were lardons included in this dish too, but all the smokiness came from the duck.  Mmmm.... The goat cheese was very creamy, and there were lovely chopped figs all over the place-- I'd order this pizza again in a heartbeat!  The profiteroles were fantastic, as well.  Three sliced choux pastry rounds, filled w/ dark chocolate sorbet, vanilla, and chocolate ice cream, sat on a pretty display made of chocolate ganache and creme anglaise, whole blackberries and blueberries, and a sliced strawberry.  More ganache was poured over the top of one profiterole upon presentation.  I asked if I could have more ganache, and our server quickly obliged-- thank you!!  We loved the crisped flakiness of the pastry (so perfect!), and out of the three flavors, we liked the fudgy dark chocolate sorbet the most.  I tell you, if I could've licked the plate clean, I would have.  :)  Excellent dessert-- I totally recommend!(*Pizza reheats well!  Still lovely in flavor and just as crispy as it was when it was first delivered.  Can't wait to go back and try the other varieties!  Happy hour UYE, anyone?)~~#~0
Not exactly what I expected ..................I liked it. I was thinking some sprawling ranch house with wood floors and saw dust everywhere, maybe some old west artifacts on the walls and grumpy old waitresses. What I got was a cool little funky building, with cool interior and neat things on the walls. More of a sports bar atmosphere with a good sized dining area. Killer staff and great food. I had a burger, I believe flat grilled, cooked medium rare and I could tell it was good beef. They said they grind it themselves. The fries were great as they are a fresh cut type. The beans were different. They were a lighter vinegary type of bean with onion and bacon. I liked them but could not eat the whole pot that came out. It ended up being a little expensive. 9 for the burger and Fries, 2.50 for the drink and 1.50 for the beans. Tax and tip it was an 18 dollar lunch.~~#~1
Worth the trip but be willing to deal with some craziness. There was a mob waiting outside before the doors even opened.1 pair of dressy sandals2 pairs of ankle boots1 pair of pumps2 dresses3 pairs of name brand nylons=$215So I got a deal. Was is the best deal ever? Probably not, but it was definitely worth the trip. Pros: Unlike other thrift/bargain stores everything is stored by size and type of item. Cons: The psycho shopper club that meets 30 mins prior to store opening!~~#~0
My daughter and I went in for pedicures and gel sets... was incredibly surprised to hear the total was $120. even with a coupon!!! When I got home I noticed that my pedicure wasn't the best... I really don't mind paying top dollar for top dollar services but even with a 'coupon' it wasn't worth it. Won't be back...~~#~1
I thought the place had a lot to offer with the atmosphere and the ingredients used in the all of the dishes.  I only thought that the menu spoke louder than the dish.~~#~0
Being a former band nerd in high school, so much nostalgia kicked in upon entering the museum. I saw all the instruments I was familiar with in high school, and many others that I wasn't familiar with (and learned much about). They supply you with headphones and a wireless receiver that plays the audio/video of the different sections you walk into. Each plays a sample of what the instruments sound like and some give detailed history on the instrument. Very enlightening experience.Best Part IMO: They have a room where you get to test random instruments to your heart's content! I really wanted to go ham on the gong but there was a sign that said something along the lines of "do not hit the gong repeatedly". I was disappoint... but otherwise many other instruments in there kept me occupied for awhile (xylophone, conga, harp, etc)It's not an arm and a leg to get inside, and this place has something for everybody. You're sure to spend a few hours enjoying yourself here.If you're going to do anything in Phoenix, this is one of the spots you should definitely check out.~~#~1
Perfect for a nightcap. Dim, moody lighting and totally intimate. Drinks are pretty pricy and didn't eat any food, but the service was great! I loved the 'feel' of the place so much I'd go back sometime.~~#~0
Went here for our anniversary.  Pretty much what you would expect from an upper end steak house.  Yes, it's pricey.  Steaks were good and service was attentive.  A good place to celebrate.~~#~1
Dinner for four at the soft opening.The food kept us talking about the tastes and combinations far into the night.Small/shared plates will fill you up quickly.  The Hamachi Crudo was a fresh, light starter with peppers, fennel and sea beans to fire up your appetite! Grilled asparagus and a delicate, cheesy risotto were great sides but the smoked beef rib was a taste sensation.  Sweet and savory, smoky and succulent, sticky and sumptuous! Bleu cheese grits and grilled peaches were the perfect pairing.  ahhhh, sigh.  I think I'd pass up the tater tots and save room for something else.  This restaurant is just what Phoenix needs.  Close to the ball parks or walk off your dinner in an invigorated downtown, Blue Hound Kitchen is a great addition to the energy.~~#~1
Good God, where has this been hiding? My bf and I just made our periodic trip to Phoenix and discovered this little gem. From his kids, no less. We went during the 8pm-10pm Happy Hour...on a Friday night. We got a table in about 20 minutes for 6 of us. Our server was super friendly and took our drink order right away. The cosmos and appletinis were $4 and the sake bombs (with Kirin or Sapporo) were $5 and numerous rolls were $5 each; how do you beat that? The food was spectacular. We ordered off of the regular menu (2 orders or tuna tataki, 2 orders of heart attacks, and a dragon roll) and the happy hour menu (crispy spicy tuna, philadelphia roll, calamari roll, shrimp tempura roll and a couple of others that I can't seem to remember). OMG, one slice of that tuna tataki and I was SOLD. This was some seriously great sushi...Bravo Yen Sushi! Our bill for 6 peeps was $96, that's with the tip included, no less...YAY! I will definitely be back.~~#~1
This place was great. When one of my coworkers sent an email to our group who was visiting Phoenix saying he had gotten us a reservation at "The BEST pizza in the country" i Was skeptical. Best pizza in Phoenix? Well, I wasn't disappointed! We had a group of 8., and we ordered almost one of everything on the menu:Apps:Antipasto - Wood Roasted Vegetables, Sopressata, Bite of CheeseSpiedini - Italian Fontina wrapped in Prosciutto di Parma, served warm Pizza:MARGHERITA - Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Basil MARINARA - Tomato Sauce, Oregano, Garlic (No Cheese) ROSA - Red Onion, Parmigiano Reggiano, Rosemary, AZ Pistachios SONNY BOY - Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Salami, Gaeta Olives BIANCOVERDE - Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta, Arugula WISEGUY - Wood Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage Of all of them, the Biancoverde was my absolute favorite! I don't eat pork, so I couldn't sample them all, but I'd happily order this one again. In fact, my team is returning next week for another team dinner for the coming Phoenix trip, and I will for sure be ordering this.Their house draft beer is also quite tasty!Tip - if you are a party of 6-10, get a reservation! They don't take reservations for smaller groups and I've heard the wait time can be a few hours at the busiest times! But worth it!~~#~1
Ok this place was great...so great I decided to sign up on yelp and contribute to the rave reviews that encouraged me to try it out in the first place. I had the fish tacos happy hour appetizer for dinner and they we cooked and seasoned well. They were really good and I would definitely order again. I was told it is off season in August, but the place was filled with locals; all very welcoming. Everyone knew everyone and if they didn't (like me) it didn't take long to feel like one of the locals. Great service, too. Will definitely go back!~~#~1
While my visit, to pick up take out was kind of drunken blur, the amazing food I ate from Diamond's after a few hours of harder than intended  drinking were JUST what the doctor ordered. My buddy did all the ordering, so all of it was a surprise, when I sat down to eat.  Quite possibly the best Hot-and-Sour soup I've had IN MY LIFE, and all of the everything else that was ordered, was smack yo' mama good. The fried rice, and lo-mein were divine (especially cuz it was a big diet cheat for me) and the EGG FOO YUNG = EGG FOO YUM. I've had much more bad Egg Foo Yung than I have had good Egg Foo Yung.. to the point that I never think to order it, cuz it usually SUCKS, but SO NOT THE CASE at Diamond's! The lady at the register = super cute, and I kinda like the "stab joint" classic chinese restaurant looks of this place.. no windows! YES! :D Five stars... the food seriously speaks for itself.~~#~1
Ok food. Super slow!! 3 employees and 2 customers and I could not believe how long it took for a quesadlla which was cold when I got it...the tacos were decent though....Give it a try and you decide though..~~#~1
I absolutely LOVE this place. Their pizza is in my top 3 as far as the selection in Arizona, and the ONLY downside is that the Tempe location (to my knowledge) still doesn't have any of the pasta dishes that some of the other locations have. The crust is always perfect, the sauce is sweet but with just the right amount of spice to it, and the cheese and toppings are flawless. On top of having some of the best pizza in town, their customer service is top-notch. If you haven't tried Spinato's yet, put it on your to-do list!~~#~1
I had yet to have tried this truck on Food Truck Friday and the line was short so I stepped on up.It's Philipino food which I had never had before and I wasn't sure what to order so I just said a word that I hoped was right. Turns out I got the pork egg rolls. I overheard another patron say they were good for Philipino food beginners. Perfect!The lady in the truck was very sweet. I paid $8 for 3 pork egg rolls, scoop of rice, some stringy things, and a bottled Coke. Average price for Food Truck Friday. I enjoyed the rolls though. They were steaming hot but the pork inside was delicious. The outside was very crunchy and flakey. I adored it!~~#~0
The acoustics are pretty good for an amphitheatre.  The process required to acquire booze is a tad ridiculous but you have to remember that you are in Mesa.  This place would certainly rate higher if it was located in a city that allowed concerts to go past 10pm.~~#~0
Brought my car here b/c of the reviews I read on yelp. My fan was running excessively. The mechanic came and looked at my car. The coolant was low. He grabbed a can and filled it up. No charge. I then told him I needed new struts. He quoted me a price that was cheaper than the one quoted to me in CO a few months ago. I honestly didn't shop around for a cheaper price here in Phoenix, which is unlike me. The reviews here, and fixing my fan problem at no charge had me sold. It seems so rare to find an honest mechanic now-a-days, especially in this economy.  Made an appt. Car was finished super quick, in the time frame that was promised. The mechanic went out of his way to show me the damage struts he replaced, then told me my new struts came with a lifetime warranty. Dang, did I time warp back into the 50s?  Hopefully I won't have a need to go back, but if I do, I'd gladly drive out of my way one hour round trip for their honesty again.~~#~1
Went here for lunch today (Wasn't feeling the hot pocket I had in the freezer here at work) What can I say. Its Subway. Its consistently mediocre. Its not overly fantastic, but its not knock me on my ass terrible. Subway is kinda like Olive Garden for me...some times you just need mediocre food. I don't know why it is...and maybe I am the only weirdo... But one thing is for certain, it always tastes the same every time I go there. Maybe it has that high school nostalgia for me. I dunno. I also like stail Necco waffers, so maybe dont pay attention to any of my reviews. I get the Spicy Italian, on cheese bread (duh), provolone cheese, light mayo, mustard, lettuce, cucumbers, olives, onions, peppers and LOTS of banana peppers, S&P. That's how I roll.~~#~0
I went for family birthday on a Friday night. Only a few people in dining room eating. (1st clue to leave.) Ordered a margarita. It's extra to have it shaken... But I ordered that way. It was mostly sour mix. An it was awful (How do you mess up a margarita?(2nd clue to leave) Server is surprised we wanted to order dinner! (3rd clue to run!) Very disappointing. I got the chicken fajitas, they had sauce all over them. Shrimp appetizer consists of 3 shrimp $8. Salsa was good.  I will never go back. Good luck Salty. I love your decor. Why don't you care you could be so cool!~~#~1
decently priced Korean food. they offer more soups and korean style casseroles - no dolsot bibimbap, BUT their kalbi tang is reallllly good! Huge bowl, lots of kalbi, yum yum yum!they're also open a lot later than many other restaurants, always a plus!~~#~0
I wish I could review the cold food stand attached to this restaurant separately because I want to tell any and all persons who think to stop by for quick sandwich to stay far, far, away from the tuna. I thought nothing was worse than slowly starving on my flight back home, but I found it in the form of this cold, barely-recognizable-as-food sandwich. I think I'd prefer eating tuna out of the can over this.~~#~1
Love Love LOVE Baker's Nursery!!  Been going there since I was a child thanks to my grandparents (my grandad and uncle used to do roofing work for the owners decades ago). Seriously...this place is FANTASTIC and the people who work there are AWESOME!  Want to know what plants/trees you have in your yard?  Bring in a leaf or bark sample and they'll tell you.  Found out we have Chinaberry trees(messy!), Lantana (evil and will not die!), 2 Trumpet vines (attracts hummingbirds!) and a Texas Sage bush (beautiful purple flowering bush) in our yard. Want to know what type of tree would do well in your yard?  Just ask!  Need something transplanted?  Buy the pots and they'll replant your plants for you.  Buy a sad looking clearance plant from another local store, they'll tell you how to nurse it back to health.  I could easily wander around Bakers for hours, except during the heat of the day in the summertime!  :)~~#~1
Over the top cheesesteaks. Best in Phoenix, perhaps the world. Amazing food and friendly service. Best ever.~~#~1
My love affair with Fate ended when Johnny left. The service, quality and atmosphere took a total nose dive.Go to Sens instead.~~#~1
Bacado. Yes, you read that correctly.... The "Bacado". It is a glorious concoction consisting of an avocado and bacon omelette with cheese on top and served with an English muffin and country fried potatoes. Decent black coffee and good service.Delicious.~~#~1
Be VERY, VERY careful asking for a sandwich as a wrap. I ordered a ham and cheese make your own sandwich, ordered it as a wrap to go. I got home, there's lettuce and mayo and... what this? what's this I see in this sandwich? there's the cut-off fingertip of someone's glove lodged between the lettuce? (At least I hope it's the finger tip of a glove - I'm not even going to think of the other thing it could have been.) Ewwww.... gross.... I didn't finish the sandwich. Memo to self: Don't ever get wraps from Einstein's, particularly not the one on Shea. Disgusting. If it ever happens again, I'm calling a local news station to report it, then I'll call the state health department. Gross, gross, gross, gross, gross, gross... if you can't deliver sanitary wraps, THEN DON'T PUT THEM ON THE MENU. Not a place to go if you like wraps.~~#~1
Green....how I love thee.  Green may be vegan/vegetarian, but I certainly wouldn't claim it to be 'health' food.  Green is located in a small run down strip mall adjacent to Kore Bicycles on the NW corner of Scottsdale Road and McKellips.  It doesn't look like much from the outside and without knowing of Green you probably wouldn't do a second take upon passing it, however the food here is no less than amazing!  The decor is unique and fresh; 10-12 tables, a couch/lounge area, random artwork on the walls, painted quotes, lights hanging from the ceiling, and old painted car doors along one wall.  I've tried a random assortment of items from the menu and nothing has disappointed me...but by far my favorite is the BBQ 'Chicken' sandwich along with an appetizer of the spicy buffalo wings.  I believe the mock chicken Green uses is fungus based, Quorn perhaps (may not sound appetizing but it is freaking awesome).  I am not personally vegan, or even vegetarian for that matter but Green has me hooked.  I've 'forced' many of my meat eating friends to try Green and they have all become believers (if you could call sharing something so wonderful forcing).Great prices, great dishes, unique/fun atmosphere, and great service!!! (On one Saturday evening around 6:30 my boyfriend and I decided to pick up some Green to go, the place had a line out the door and it took about 30-45 min to get our food.  We weren't even upset about the wait, just waited patiently for our delicous order and upon arrival the server gave us two free entree tickets for our next visit and apologized.  THIS is how you keep your customers coming back for MORE!)  Love this place so much!~~#~1
Excellent macaroons!  Great owners very conversant with their costumers.~~#~1
Best pizza place ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!~~#~1
Angel sweet is without a doubt the best gelato I've had outside of Italy.~~#~1
I give this review a total 1 star If I was able to, I would have rated no stars at all!.... I would NEVER reccomend ANYONE to live here. The office staff is horrible and made me feel uncomfortable the whole year I lived there based on THEIR MISTAKES! I can not express how disappointed I am with the way that they have treated me.....~~#~1
A good place for bugers and fries.~~#~0
My husband and I tried this place out since it is fairly close to our house and gets decent reviews.  I drank, my husband ate.  The wine selection is ok and the staff seemed friendly.  My husband's dinner was okay.  I'd probably give this place better reviews had they not attempted to give themselves a $15 bump on their tip.  I'd also probably give them better reviews if the manager would have called me back after leaving a message with a staff member about the charge especially when I left all the details necessary to fix the issue and was promised a call back that afternoon when the manager arrived.  Now, I can only assume it was not an inadvertent mistake since they give me no reason to believe otherwise.  I really would rather not have to keep calling back and chase my $$ down.Edited review - took them from 1 star to 3 stars since I received a phone call today from a manager and was advised it was a mistake and they credited me back the funds.  Also will be sending me a gift card for the trouble.  Overall, I appreciate the follow up and their efforts to fix the issue and bring me back in.  I was routing for them since the patio seems like a pretty chill place to have some drinks and unwind.~~#~0
We checked out the prices at The Dump, the sales person there just were too pushy. and their prices were not the lowest.  We checked out the prices at Mattress Firm to see if they were any cheaper.  We had a wonderful experience!  The salesperson was friend and helpful NOT pushy at all.  They had the i-select model bed that my friend was looking for.  They were $200 cheaper, delivery was cheaper, and free tempur pedic pillows.  SOLD!!!  My friend is happy as a customer.~~#~1
I ate here over the weekend while attending Comicon.  I was actually pretty hungover at the time and desperately needed to plug my gut.  It was between this and a deli I saw a little bit down the way but pizza always, always sounds good so I made my decision.  In my mind, in a fight between a pizza and a sandwich, the pizza would always win because it has the power of molten-hot cheese and pepperoni shields.Yay:  It was like $6 bucks for a big slice of pizza and a salad and a drink.  That's a really, really good deal.  The salad that I got wasn't like an amazing salad but it had onions on it and croutons and had a strong flavor.  It wasn't bad.  If I were a teacher and my class assignment was, "Throw a salad together super quick and cheap," and I got that salad, I'd give it a B.Nay:  The pizza was not so good.  But, you know, it was pizza and pizza is hard to fuck up so it was salvageable.  The big problem was that it was so greasy.  I mean the pizza sweat grease like a fat man's back.  If I were a teacher and my class assignment was, "Make me a cheap ass piece of pizza that tastes good," I'd give this slice of pizza like a C.  I choked that shit down though and washed it down with salad and raspberry iced tea.So, you know, the pizza wasn't great, but after I got done eating I felt a lot better.  I had the strength and energy to check out Comicon for the rest of the day.  I geeked out good.~~#~0
We Care Family Wellness Center is the most exceptional doctor's office and staff that I have ever found. Every employee here genuinely cares about you. I highly recommend.~~#~1
Remember how I said that the Trivia was the best thing about this place?  Well, they got rid of long time Triva host, Dave (who had been featured in the College Times and was the best thing about the trivia).  Without Dave's personality, this place just doesn't cut it.  Will never go here again. Bummer.~~#~1
if you want a really filling, delicious "please-make-my-head-stop-feeling-like-it's-about-to-explode" hangover cure, there guys have got the remedy!  the hangover helper is all of the above and get's even better when you add the hair of the dog bloody mary for an extra $3! (they also have live music on sundays during brunch!)the architecture and windows are stunning in this place - if you've never been in here, it's worth checking it out!~~#~0
Best damn Brownies on the planet (or close to it)! Words cannot explain how good they are. The only negative is that this palce is located across the street from my office! Way too much temptation.~~#~1
Had some time to kill before the Ultimate pleY Date Yelp event, and I'd wanted to share my love of Nobuo's Dark chocolate mousse with green tea ice cream and sugared orange peels with my happy-go-lucky cousin, who has never been here before, so we stopped by at 5:17p to find that Nobuo wouldn't open till 5:30p, so we waited outside in the comfortable patio.After watching a couple of employees add lanterns to their outdoor umbrellaed tables, I noticed the "OPEN" sign on the front door, so we entered the resto, whereupon we were greeted warmly by a male host and shown to a two-top.  I didn't like the energy in that room, so I asked if we could sit elsewhere, and he said to choose wherever we wanted to sit.  We were the first customers, so we chose a four-top, knowing we wouldn't be taking up space for very long, anyway.  Glasses of water were delivered, and soon we met our female server (whose name on the receipt reflected "Butai").  When she laid down the menus, I told her we would only be having dessert and could we see the dessert menu?  I wished we had a video of the look she gave us, a look of pure distaste, as she gathered up the dinner and beverage menus and said "We don't have dessert menus, as we only have two..." and proceeded to tell us of the mousse and the almond-orange fritters.  She walked away, and as we loudly discussed about our losing our interest in dining there, she came back with napkins and utensils and asked if we decided what we were going to have.  I decided to forgo our server's very cold treatment and asked for the mousse.  After all, I'd already finished a glass of ice-cold water and cousin's phone needed recharging...  When Butai placed our chocolate mousse http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog?select=rK8m1rxl50PB69_c2YqQTg#rK8m1rxl50PB69_c2YqQTg on the table, I wanted to send it back.  Where was the lovely bowl and presentation of the last dessert I had here?  Was she serious in presenting us with this stale-looking mousse, with cracked edges and whose green tea ice cream had ice crystals on it?  I don't know about you, but the only times I've seen crystals on ice cream is when it has slightly melted and placed back in the freezer to re-freeze.  For me, seeing crystals on ice cream is a sign that it is old...  I brought the receptacle and showed it to the male host, who assured me that all of the mousse is made daily at 4:00a and seeing cracks and bubbles in the mousse is normal, so I decided we would go ahead and try it, if for nothing else but to have something to report here.  The dessert was definitely not up to par with the pretty bowl http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog?select=o9jIksB-MObhCxoI_msekQ#o9jIksB-MObhCxoI_msekQ I had during our October OYE in taste and presentation, but it was OK.  The mousse was still cold and stiff, and it had a mouth-feel more of like thick chocolate ganache filling/icing on a cake- certainly not the silky-smooth chocolate decadence I knew it could be.  My cousin had to warm up to the dish, as the sound of chocolate and green tea together didn't seem like a great combo to her (I told her to trust me).  She also never enjoyed orange and chocolate together, but she liked it in this dessert.  I understand that the knowledge of having to serve only dessert instead of dinner AND dessert, which translates to a higher table bill, can be a bit of a disappointment, but why must you show your displeasure to your guests?  Butai, you were lucky that my cousin even left you the change for a tip- she didn't want to give you anything, and you certainly didn't deserve it!  When I told other Yelp friends about the sub-par service and dessert we just had, one replied she didn't enjoy the last time we had apps here (I think it was around Halloween and First Friday?) either.  Cousin and I thought it very poor taste that our server gave us that awful, condescending look after finding out we were just going to have dessert; We didn't deserve that!  I am never going to recommend Nobuo to anyone, anymore.  I even promised my Japanese friend (who lives and works overseas) I'd treat her to a dining experience here when she comes to visit.  Guess I'll have to find another place to take her...  I don't want to risk getting the same treatment from Butai, or from another server should we come back here.  Sorry, Nobuo, but I won't be returning.~~#~1
i tried the thai river noodles. they will not replace the love i have for a dan dan noodle bowl. but the thai noodles, they were good.i like this place because it has really opened hours compared to everything else around here. and the food in inconsistent. oh also, the new soda machines are very entertaining. just watch....this is usually a last resort option (everything else in the area is closed). but it is a good one nonetheless.~~#~1
What an amazing place!!  I had an incredibly enjoyable time staying at the Royal Palms Resort, and recommend it highly.  So many excellent points:  absolutely gorgeous accommodations, polite and helpful staff, excellent restaurant (breakfast/ brunch outside, with a delicious cup of coffee, is a must), a great spa, and a relaxing atmosphere.  My boyfriend and I stayed here for a conference in late October, which is a great season in Arizona.  Our stay was a pleasure from beginning to end.  The resort is well-suited for special occasions (there was a wedding reception and an outdoor conference dinner during our stay).  Our room was very comfortable, with excellent set-up and a great view of the mountains from the balcony.  The resort includes a pool, a small gym, several lounge areas with firepits and fireplaces, and the wonderful Alvadora spa (with massages, facials, outdoor-facing showers, and shaded lounge areas to your heart's content).  There are several mountain trails a short walk/ drive away from the resort, and downtown Scottsdale is 10-15 minutes away by car.  In all, a beautiful place for a special occasion!~~#~1
This is my favorite coffee spot in AZ.  They know how to make a fantastic Americano.  They use very good coffee and a real European espresso machine.  I hate those machines that Starbucks uses with the coffee storage on top and the preset grinders.  YUCK.  The cafe has a comfortable and welcoming Vice.  Everyone will say hello to you when you walk in the door.They do have free wifi, but it is REAL SLOW!!  That is my only complaint.  They need to crank it up!~~#~1
Can I review some of the people who go here? Because I know one idiot who would get 1 star.  (But the park still gets a 5)One dude let his dog pee on me! And the little bugger was fast! He'd prance toward you, and before you knew it, his leg was up and piss was streaming out of his winky cannon! My friend was tinkled on multiple times; she wasn't able to jump out of the way very quickly since she was pregnant. Did the man say anything? Only that his dog was only nervous. Are you kidding me?Alright, I got your number. In return, we very actively encouraged our Australian Shepherd to play with the little terrier. Why? Because the Aussie Shep becomes a drool monster at the dog park, and the little pissing terrier (who only likes to pee on people, not trees or anywhere else in the park) ended up DRIPPING the Aussie Shep's saliva. Sweet! (that was the only time we didn't feel guilty about her saliva marking other dogs).~~#~1
Air Jordan! need I say more?~~#~0
Unique atmosphere in the city of Glibert with AMAZING food....  Beware some weekends the line is super long but its worth the wait... be prepared to eat outside in a nice shady area enjoying a farm like atmosphere...Good seafood is hard to find in Az & Farm grill does a great job.... also great burgers!  If you don't mind driving out to Gilbert its 1 of the best places to eat in the Phx area..~~#~1
my family and i hosted my sister's graduation sendoff here and it was a great event!debbie in the events office as well as the staff she sent us to be of service throughout the event were wonderful.food was delicious - we ordered buffet style (chicken milanese, sirloin steak, appetizers, and beverages) for about 150 people. the tech staff was very helpful in setting up our equipment for a slide show as well as providing equipment for us to play our own music at the event.servers were polite and accomodating to any of the guests' requests.and the facility is beautiful.they even let me go super early in the morning being the type A personality i am to decorate myself and set things up.overall wonderful experience with this resort and its staff. would love to host another event here in the future.thanks, scottsdale plaza resort!~~#~1
Went here last night for the first time in years. I used to hang out all the time here when I was younger. It was packed by 1030. Great music mostly top 40 and hip hop..no techno yay! Good looking crowd and not as pretentious and the rest of Scottsdale. Everyone had a blast..dancing everywhere. Friendly crowd. Reasonably priced drinks for Scottsdale. I cannot wait to come back. Patties still has it!~~#~1
One of the most impressive spots in town. Lunch here is a luxury experience - the grounds are amazingly beautiful, and the menu surprisingly affordable. Try this for an inexpensive way to really impress a business client.For dinner they will take your shorts, though it is certainly worth it if you desire a truly memorable, elegant evening. Life is too short - try this restaurant soon!I have yet to stay here (Royal Palms hotel) - but it is definitely on my list of 1001 things to do before I expire.~~#~1
A few days after the amazing Yelp event at Brio, I decided to go back to enjoy my FREE bruschetta! This visit was yet again, AMAZING! First off, Kimberly, our waitress, was the most personable, helpful, awesome waitress ever! She was very insightful and suggested some pretty tasty appetizers. I'm not a fan of eggplant, but she assured me it was to-die-for. She was not lying, it was delicious!They also had the same live music as the Yelp event had and he was just the perfect sound for a happy hour date on the patio.Then, to top it off, the manager that was hosting the Yelp event came over and introduced himself. Thanked me for going to the Yelp event and for coming back! So hospitable! I felt like I had a second royal treatment!Thanks Brio, you guys are awesome!! :)~~#~1
Our 1st visit to Renegade Canteen last night.  We made reservations and were a little late getting there,  but they had our table waiting which was nice because the place was packed.  Atmosphere is very nice.  Beautiful building and a nice layout.  Next time we plan to eat in the bar.  We had to try Bob's Big Burger and what a big burger it was!  Quality meat (bacon was to die for).  Big onion, big tomato.  What more could you ask for?  Mr. McGrath was in the restaurant and he came by our table to say hello and ask if we were enjoying ourselves.  Great guy!  And our waiter was very attentive (not pushy) but always seemed to show up at the right time.We plan on going back for sure.  Give it a try.  You won't be disappointed.Catch Chef McGrath on Channel 8 PBS "Check Please, Arizona".  He does a good job and watching the show makes you hungry.Thanks Renegade Canteen for having us.~~#~1
So many flavors and the ice is melt in your mouth soft. Add cream to make it a little better than a normal icey treat! Lots of sugar free flavors too! Mmm!~~#~1
Zipps has good bar food, but the service is usually horrible. The waitresses rarely come to your table. BUT, what really rubs me the wrong way is this....On multiple occasions, when I pay the bill, the waiter doesn't bring me back the correct change. Even if my change is 1 cent, I'm entitled to receive my money back. I'm sorry, but not giving me back my  change because you deem it insignificant doesn't float well with me. They do have great food though.~~#~0
I was very impressed and surprised by the quality of this restaurant!  This place is STYLISH - whether it's the plush lounge chairs on the patio, or the old school movies being projected on the walls - there's definitely an element of class that is rare for the Mill Avenue district.First impressions were extremely positive - the place was busy but not packed, candlelit tables, and dim lighting provides the perfect atmosphere for a date, but not too much so that it causes that uncomfortable, formal, anxiety feeling.  La Bocca almost seems like an AZ88 in Tempe for those who are fans.  I was pleasantly surprised at the prices on the menu.  Most items were in the $10-15 range, and I was immediately intrigued by the various pizza selections.  I focused my sights on the garden pizza, which took me by surprise because it was basically a chef-tossed salad on a really good pizza crust.  My girlfriend went with the bruschetta planks and chose two homemade pesto, one mozarella basil, and one roasted artichoke - DELICIOUS!Top that off with a few glasses of really good sangria and you've got a really good meal for right around the $40-50 mark.  Needless to say we will be returning!~~#~1
Stop here every time I'm in town!~~#~1
The spring on our garage door broke and we had no idea who to call.  Lodi was recommended to us but they werne't specific as there are a few under this name.  I choose Lodi Garage Doors & More and was stunned they sent someone out within 1.5 hours!  They also quoted me on the phone and were so nice in setting up the appointment and calling back to confirm.Gene was our technician, he was efficient, friendly and did a fantastic job.  I will be passing Lodi's name on for sure and if repairs are needed in the future I will not hesitate to call!  Thank you for you quick, professional, friendly service!~~#~1
I've only eaten the buffet here and it was good but nothing special.  To be fair, most Indian buffets are pretty similar, it's only when you order from the menu that you see if the restaurant is really a stand-out.  So, I will update this review when I've gone there for dinner~~#~0
Lovely shop, great cupcake selection, friendly service.  But the real question is...how do the cupcakes taste???  Pretty good.  I tried (4) flavors and they ranged from OK to YUMMMMMM!  Vanilla with chocolate buttercream was ok, the Coconut was good (a bit dry, but decent flavor), the Carrot was very good, and the Mocha was YUMMMMMM!   They were all super sweet though.  My husband and I both had a quarter of each flavor and that was more than enough.  From a flavor variety and taste perspective, Sprinkles is a 3.5 - 4.  However, I really can't justify spending $14.00 for (4) cupcakes.  They are expensive so they can pay their overhead and lease costs, not because of exotic ingredients or special decorating skills.  Don't get me wrong, I'm sure they use good ingredients, but the wrappers are plain, there's no special piping or fondant work, and the flavors are standard. They are just plain good cupcakes...not fantastic, but good.  Certainly not worth $3.50 a cupcake.  I do a ton of baking and I get special order requests from friends and neighbors all the time.  I always do nice decorating and use premium ingredients and the most I charge is $2.00 a cupcake...and that's only if I use fondant.~~#~0
We have been using Delia's Cleaners now for nearly three years and for the most part found the experience to be very good.  Yes, like most cleaners they goof from time to time (like sometimes killing the button-downs on my dress shirts).  But, here's the difference -- they'll fix them for no charge.  Yep.  Just ask, the staff is very helpful!~~#~0
Living in this area I frequent Desert Ridge a lot, and have been to this Macaroni Grill several times... their food is actually pretty good which is why I let the horrible service slide a few times... My friend and I have had experiences such as standing at the host stand with no assistance for several minutes while several employees made eye contact. Of course, no one asked if we had been helped, until the hostess finally made her way back up to the stand and decided to ignore us for another couple of seconds before she even acknowledged us. Another visit we were seated right away however it took over 15 minutes for our server to come to our table, and that was only after I had to get out of my seat and find one of the employees to ask for our server. I know several people saw us just sitting there, the least they could have done was asked if we had been helped or not. This last experience, was about a year after the last. I thought maybe they would have changed. I most definitely thought wrong! We were seated promptly and the server was there right away this time. However, our food took FOREVER! Literally, it took over 30 minutes for a medium rare steak and a plate of pasta. I know for a fact they messed something up and ended up taking food out of a to go container and placing it on the plate that they then brought to me (you can see right into their kitchen from the dining room). The server never apologized nor did she come and tell us what the hold up was. Overall, I will never go to that restaurant again.~~#~1
Fabulous! Great views (obviously) of the city. Very romantic. Amazing wine list. Superb service. Delicious menu. Luis was our server - great guy full of very helpful information (especially wine pairings). LOVE the lobster bisque (I'm usually not a fan of lobster or bisque). Amazing flavor combinations in everything we tried. I also love ending my meal with a perfect vanilla bean creme brulee. Highly recommend if you're bringing a newbie to Phoenix or if you'd like a romantic night out.~~#~1
If I could give it more than 5, I would.  Sweet Pea and I live down the street, literally DOWN THE STREET, from this bar.  We waited for it to open for what seemed like decades, praying that this was going to be the type of place that could become our local.  It has exceeded our expectations.  The atmosphere is amazing.  The drinks are amazing- every last one of them- but the margaritas are the best I've ever had.  They tasted like a fresh squeeze of sunshine that makes me happy inside.  Margarita Mondays- $4 margs AND free food?  Happy hours are amazing.  New Year's Eve last year was amazing.  The 1 year anniversary party was amazing.  But most of all, the owner and staff are some of the coolest peeps that you'll ever meet.  Go here.  You will love it.~~#~1
This review is for locals...the Hyatt isn't just a beautiful spot to stay it, it's also a perfect spot to just sit and enjoy the day! I've done this several times, many times for dinner and drinks afterward on the patio. Most recently, I decided to set up shop and do some work from one of the comfy chairs on the outdoor patio which allowed me to enjoy the gorgeous Arizona weather and still get some work done. They do an excellent job of making the hotel amenities comfortable and welcoming. For hotel guests, if you are planning to stay here, be sure to look into staying in one of the rooms that sit on the man made lake. They have great patios right on the water so when you wake up, you could have breakfast on the lake! It doesn't get much better than that.~~#~1
I love Mexican food. Today I ate half of a taco and simply had to stop; not in a good way either. The meat tasted like it had been frozen multiple times and lacked flavor. The tortilla tasted like it was store bought and made of paper. The beans were flavorless. The rice was hard and lacked any flavor. Moving to the vegetables: shredded plastic is not actually a vegtable. This is some of the worst tasting, most over priced Mexican food I had had. It would be one thing if it was reasonably priced, but $10 for taco is a absurd amount for a worst than fast-food taste. The margarita was good, but $10 for a margarita is a bit on the high side.The service was average, but I found it odd that my waitress didn't find it odd that only a bite of each item was missing and never asked how the food tasted.~~#~1
The food was not particularly good on our last visit there and the service was rude and not helpful at all.  I even emailed them afterwards to give feedback, in hopes that they would redeem themselves by showing some good service that way.  No luck.  Didn't even get a response.They will not be getting any more of my business.  Too bad because I'd actually had a decent mushroom burger there before and would have been a regular customer.  But the service last time was so bad that I won't go back.~~#~1
I've been to this Dick's location a bunch of times and I've got to say that I've gotten more help from the employees in this one that I've ever gotten from any other location.I've spent some major time with the guys in the gun dept and they're always more that helpful regardless of how busy and how many people they have waiting for them.  Major props to those guys for good knowledge and patience.Another time I was there I wanted some new shorts for softball and they didn't have and L's left but jokingly I checked the Under Armour manikin as he was wearing the same shorts, and what do ya know... L.  It was near closing time and the associates were getting their stuff done so they could go home (I've worked retail and I know at closing time you just want everybody to bail so you can clean and go home).  I asked a girl around the corner I was able to rob the manikin of his clothes and she laughed and had no problem taking him apart and yankin the shorts right off!  I was so happy as I had a game the next day and didn't want to be running around looking for these shorts.Think I'm joking? lol - http://www.flickr.com/photos/ryno/4113416766/Anyways - good store, always clean and everybody seems very nice and knowledgable in their area.  Never had an issue there.~~#~1
I found some great t-shirts for friends here, including one from a local PHX artist with a grinning skull.  If you're a hipster or looking to buy gifts for one, then this is the place to go. Plus, the clerk was using a Mac (not that I would expect anything different, but bonus verisimilitude points for fitting in with your surroundings Mr. Clerk).~~#~1
Hot Bagels. To a random passerby, it's like any bagel place really. To locals and Midwestern students, it's a holy temple. And to me, well it's a highly overrated bagel place. But hey, it's still delicious! Especially if you're in the mood for a bagel.But it's kinda pricey. I ultimately paid like $8 for a bagel with lox, cream cheese, and a bag of chips. Seriously?? I mean, yes, it was one of the best bagels I've ever had but I could've gone next door to Senor Taco and gotten a burrito for $3 less and have enough for a dry-cleaning job at the $2.25 cleaners adjacent!And that's what brings this place down. While bagels are delicious and it's hard to mess up bagels, it's still just a bagel. So if you're feeling like having a bagel, definitely check this place out. It's on par with or better than Einstein Bros. Just don't be overhyped by all the love the locals have for this place because in the end, you're just having a bagel. =)~~#~0
I'm giving the 3 stars solely for 1 reason: The veggie sandwich! There's normally only 1 person waitressing/taking orders, so expect a slow turn around during breakfast & lunch time. To avoid the crowds I'd pick up a flier in the morning, call around 10 am & pre-order for pick up. If I had no time to wait to check out I would simply ask for delivery. A girls gotta eat! :)~~#~0
Excellent wings. I realized how much I miss this place when I ate horrible chicken wings in San Jose. It gets crowded Tuesday and Thursday because of special deal on wings, but definetly worth it. They do not have any Native NewYorker in CA :(~~#~1
The pupusas, yes, the pupusas are great. The loroco with cheese has become our favorite, But this past week, I strayed from our standard and tried the gallina soup with braised chicken and salad. All I can say is, "What the hell? Where has this been my whole life?" The soup is magical. Huge chunks of carrot, potato, and zucchini, with some thin noodles, and a savory broth with some mint leaves. I quickly abandoned the rest of my entree in favor of finishing the huge bowl of magic. It was the best soup I've had since coming to Phoenix 13 years ago. Good thing Hubby got sick this weekend- it gave me an excuse to go back and get some more. Being magical, you know it has serious healing properties. Here's where I learned that the Sopa de Gallina is chicken soup without the chicken meat and the Sopa de Pollo is the same thing but with the meat. Two huge Styrofoam cups to go with lemon wedges and 4 hot and fresh tortillas cost less than $6.00. I was stunned. The owner said it costs more with meat. Believe me, you won't miss it. Who knew that magic was so cheap? Hubby's fever is already down and he's feeling much better.~~#~1
I had a great experience.  Nice people.   My minnie poodle mix looked great and was happy when he came out!   Total bill: $43 + tip including cut, blow dry, ears,  toenails, anal glands and teeth.  Located in the Goodwill parking lot. This is my first dog, and my first experience with a groomer.  I called on a Saturday and had to make an appointment for the next Saturday, so they are busy.I asked the front desk guy where the price/package list was.  He said they didn't really have a 'list' so I told him what I needed and I wanted to know how much it would be.  He went in back and the groomer came out to take a look at him and talk to me.  She quoted me $38 and I asked how much for teeth, she added on $5.  They gave me a guide to determine how short I wanted him cut and asked me specifics on what type of cut (I said shave him, it's summer).  they asked about ears, tail, etc.I brought him in at 9 and they had me pick him up at 1.  I don't know a lot about grooming yet but they said depending on how he was under the blower he might need to be kennel dried.  When I came back at 1 they were finishing up his head.  I can imagine he might have been a tough client, given that he is still puppy-hyper and not yet accustomed to the spa treatment.  He was blow dried for sure; His former curly hair was completely straight and soft.  The shop is no frills.  No pretty sign out front and no decorating inside.  I think they could make more money with some product around or maybe charge more if there was a little more spa feeling when you walk in, but I will go back again for sure.  My poodle mix is 6 months old and this was his second cut.  (The first was done by a family member).  My poor puppy went in looking like a mess and I didn't recognize him when he came out!  He was soft, had a nice cut and smelled great, even his breath!~~#~1
Cute little coffee shop. Had some tea and sat outside with my boyfriend. Enjoyed the weather and played some cards. Very relaxing.~~#~0
Why oh why can't there be one of these closer to my house?! I would take them any day over Subway. Their bread is fresh, their meat and cheese is sliced perfectly thin. This may sound strange too, but every Mr. Goodcents I've been too has the BEST soda fountain Coke. Okay...I said it. Judge me. I do prefer the Mr. Goodcents over in Tempe off of 48th Street, but this one is just as good.~~#~1
I'm a big fan of their strawberry water and if I'm looking for a better lunch than what I have at home I'll swing by and pick up a salad from here.  They have a good selection- and it's constantly expanding.~~#~1
I went there with a friend last year after reading so many good reviews. The service is good. We didn't have to wait but I didn't like the food I ordered. I had a salmon with caper butter sauce. The fish is not fresh at all and the food is too geasy for me.~~#~1
I think that they have the BEST pizza in town!!!! Way better than Pizzeria Bianco!!!!!~~#~1
Yelper Jane B's review is remarkably similar to what I intended to include in my review.We've stayed at close to a dozen different Homewood Suites over the years and this one left us wishing we could have stayed at any of the others instead.Furnishings were adequate but not terribly comfortable.  The living room had a sleeper sofa and a side chair, a dining table with two chairs, an end table, a coffee table, and a TV stand with 3 drawers plus the kitchenette, all in a room roughly 9' x 14'.The bedroom contained a desk with 3 drawers (serving also as the dresser) and the bed and nightstands.  The desk also served as the TV stand, allowing a small work area and taking up so much room the door couldn't swing all the way open.Our bedroom also contained the mystery deadbolted closet with unknown contents, which took up half the guest closet space.The bathroom was large but dingy and dimly lit.I considered renting an on-demand movie one evening, but everything offered by the hotel was $15+/each (!!) and since there wasn't a DVD player we didn't have the opportunity to rent somewhere more reasonable and bring it back to our room.  Free wifi seemed stable although a bit slow, and the pool was small but the kids didn't seem to mind.The staff were very friendly and helpful, and the breakfast was well-prepared and always had enough variety to keep the kids and adults happy.We got a great rate but hey, it's Scottsdale in the summer so most rates are pretty darn good.  Normally we enjoy staying away from home, but after 6 nights here even the kids were anxious to get home.We'll stay at Homewood Suites again in the future, but not this one.~~#~0
What can I say, this place has it all. Great service, a hugh variety of food to choose from.I really like their pesto chicken grilled pizza, but I could go on forever with all my favorites. Check out there craft beers too.Simply delicious.~~#~1
Killer sandwiches and dill potato salad that set my world on end.I wish I had known of Bertha's while I was in town for a long period of time because I would have eaten here everyday.  I went for the blue cheese roast beef sandwich which was a magical meal.  Lightly toasted bread, slightly sweet mustard mayo, fresh veggies and the most beautiful sliced roast beef I have seen in a long time, this sandwich was nothing short of awesome, damn it was good.  As a side I got the dill potato salad, this stuff is NOT your grandmothers potato salad, this is what your grandmother should have been giving you.  Holy wow, creamy dill potato greatness.  I am going to have to figure out how to get this out to me in LA.The deserts looked great and the little chocolate brownie cookie gave me an idea of how good the other offerings most likely are.Bertha's is awesome, fresh sando's, salads, wraps and potato salad that will redefine the potato.  Bertha's please open a location in LA, I will keep you afloat!~~#~1
Truly the best pizza I've had so far in AZ. Reminded me of NY pizza, thin crust... and crusty! I could eat this crust alone it's so good!..  In fact I did!!! Ate it with a little olive oil and it was yuyuyummy! Also had the antipasti, so glad they actually give you REAL antipasti and not a mesh of crazy salad... you have to try this place if you haven't already.  My husband and I got a small pizza and had enough to take home for leftovers... and we are BIG eaters! RICO!!!~~#~1
Hot fudge Sunday was watered down so much. You would do much better by going to mcdonalds. This isn't the first time. I should quit giving this place chances. I'm disappointed every time. I once asked for hot fudge on the bottom of my sundae and was charged $2.60 more. The staff is rarely friendly. They should consider being friendly since it IS Dairy Queen, a place that takes many of us back to our childhoods. The array of desserts are so wonderful why not serve them wonderfully and with a smile, and not like you hate your job and just want to go home?~~#~1
This is a fancy fine dining restaurant with a casual feel. The food is definitely under priced. For most of the summer, drinks are cheap and food is half off for the all day happy hour to entice the locals. During the winter, you can't get into this place. It is packed, so reservation is recommend. The food is described as American Southwest. The best three choices to have for the first visit. Is the Famous "BIG_ASS" Burger, Green Chile Pork Stew, & Lamb Fondue. These choices will hit the spot and hit the wallet for 10 bucks with tip a person.~~#~1
My boyfriend and I were searching for a dive near our house in Old Town for when we just aren't feeling the typical Scottsdale vibe.  I gotta tell you, I think we found it.  We walked in around 7 on a Thursday night, just looking to have a few drinks and some time to talk.  I immediately realized this was not an Old Town bar.  I think I might have been the youngest person there and no one was pretentious at all.  They have a dart board and pool table, and seating with walled mirrors all around.  The patio was extremely well-misted, which was great since it was the day before 4th of July and everyone was pretty much sweltering.  Drinks were stiff and not too expensive and the crowd grew younger as the night went on.  I didn't meet tons of people, but the ones iI did either seemed drunk, super nice or both - not a bad combination.  I would go back again, just not every night (what do you think I am, an alcoholic?)Also - for those of you with bladders of steel and small wallets, I saw a sign that says they do bladder buster deals on Tuesday night.  Small cover and incredibly cheap drinks until someone "breaks the seal".  I would suck at this, but I'm sure many a person has taken advantage of this interesting drink special.~~#~0
Simply put this place is AWESOME.  If you're looking to start a business or already own a business but need some of the details on a particular area, this is the place to be.  So far I've only attended a Brown bag lunch but I was thoroughly impressed by the people who were there. However, don't show up with out being ready to put in your two cents, its needed to keep the ball going, I thought it was really good.  I can't wait to go back!~~#~1
I love Jimmy Johns.  It is WAY better than Subway.  The bread is what makes it.  They bake their own bread right in the store and then right before they make your sandwich, they pluck out the middle of the bread to fill your sandwich with goodness.  You choose your sandwiches by number, but you can customize any sandwich.  I usually get the #4 which is a Tom Turkey.  It has turkey, lettuce, tomato, lettuce and sprouts on it.  I like their chips too.  They call them Jimmy Chips.  They are the kettle cooked type.  I personally do not think this is your ordinary sandwich.  The combination of bread and ingredients makes it a great sandwich and they are fast to prepare.~~#~1
I had my brows done one month ago.  Heather did an amazing job!  I went back after 2 weeks for a "no charge" touch up.  I haven't worn brow powder or pencil since, and most importantly my brows look TOTALLY natural.  I give her 5 stars and would strongly recommend her.  As a matter of fact I am going to go back and have my lips done!~~#~1
I'm not one for hyperbole, but this may have beenTHE  BEST      MEAL      OF   MY       LIFE!!!!I'd like to hold an awards show and give out lifetime achievement trophies to the following individuals:1.  To the chef, who exceeded my expectations again and again. The Stetson salad, wild boar meatballs, and Korean-style BBQ short ribs (and that killer side of au-gratin brussel sprouts) and you, sir, have won my heart and my stomach.  I want to fill a swimming pool with that BBQ sauce!2.  To our server, Richard.  Your genuine excitement for the food was a nice change from past servers reluctant to give a real recommendation.  You were cordial and professional and made sure we enjoyed our time with you.  I don't know, I may name my unborn child after you in tribute.3.  To the pastry chef, Country.  Your bread pudding was exceptional, but what a surprise, your ice creams were downright dreamy!  The scoop of brown butter ice cream took my tastebuds on a field trip through chilled fields of chocolate truffles.Thank you thank you for a wonderful birthday dinner!~~#~1
This Chipotle Rocks!  Today, I express my joyIn the haiku form!Perfect fast food joint;Fresh, delicious, quick and kind.The price is right, too!Burritos galore;In a tortilla or bowl.But wait, there is more!Three steak tacos, please!Or grilled veggie fajitas?Oh sweet perfection.A simple menu,Yet so many decisions.How can you go wrong?Answer:  You cannot!  Order now, you won't regret,This Chipotle Rocks!~~#~1
Last time I went to Zinburger I was wearing a black dress, and the hostess switched out the white napkin with a black one.... real classy.~~#~1
my son loves the splash pad! His dad or uncles stay with him at the playground while I can run in the store or two that I need to! There are quite a few empty retail spots, hopefully they can get some new stores in there as well,~~#~1
We are picky about food because we try to eat healthy. Owner and server were very accommodating and courteous. They took time to understand what we want and delivered on it. One gripe, we had difficulty finding it because neon sign was not working. We had a great experience.~~#~1
I have never actually been to a pawn shop for any reason. I can't honestly even tell you what they are used for. I have never seen Pawn Stars. I don't watch television. I really enjoy this signage. On an almost daily basis. Savy, that is all it is. Love of a little morning chuckle.~~#~0
I love this place! This was the 4th and final stop on our search for a great dive bar in Old Town. Coach House was just was the doctor ordered, that is if the doctor had ordered you to find a great dive bar. I'm still trying to find a doctor who will do that.Anyway, from the minute we walked up to the guy checking ID's it was a great experience. Everyone was friendly and chill. People actually talked to you and were having a good time. It was a great mix of people.We played pinball with some guy we met who I renamed the Pinball Wizard. I also found out that I am not as good at pinball after I have been drinking. Apparently if affects your hand eye coordination or something like that. Who knew? ;) We also had fun hanging out with some other dudes we met there, and my drinks were $4.25. What more could I ask for? Great bar, great night!~~#~1
This is one of my absolute favorite bars in Old Town. It is casual with really good food but plays loud top 40 music with great drinks. What more could you ask for?Service is great and the bathrooms are clean. The restaurant has outdoor seating which is great for people watching and right in the heart of Old Town nightlife.You're within walking distance to The Mint, Dollhouse, Smashboxx, and the Pussycat Lounge. If I didn't live a $40 cab ride away (one-way) I'd come here way more often. Lots of huge flat panel tvs and plenty of seating. It gets packed on weekends but the place is pretty big so it never feels overwhelmingly crowded. This is not a good place to dance. There is actually no dance floor. But maybe that won't stop you or I after a few drinks...~~#~1
Have you not tried Which Wich yet? Do it. Buffalo chicken= hands down, my favorite sandwich ever in the world. I can't wait to get pregnant so I have an excuse to eat them every day. I used to go to one in CO all the time and I really remembered loving it- when I found out one had opened by my work, it secured a regular spot on my lunch-break rotation until I realized maybe I shouldn't be eating sandwiches all week.  I now prefer to hit up the AJ's next door for cheap tea and salad bar (healthier, obviously) but sometimes I wind up in the parking lot of AJ's only to instead go over to Which Wich... it's seriously delicious stuff. My husband love the Thanksgiving Turkey feast sandwich (probably has a cooler name than that) and my backup fave is the chicken pesto (be sure to add bacon.) Always- and I do mean ALWAYS- get your sandwich toasted. Trust me. I'm a fattie who loves her some good sandwiches.~~#~1
My gf and I just tried the Oggie bc we werent super hungry.  Even with that, the food was super yummy.  I wonder what would happen to us if we are actually starving.  the sauce that came with the Oggie was excellent too, so I suggested that you shouldnt eat the pasty without the sauce.  The decoration in the store is quite unique: church pews and wall and table deocrations.  It's a must go if you are around the area.~~#~1
I loathe you, you tasty cheesy bastards...oh, and can I have a large pepperoni to go?~~#~1
We didnt feel like going out and decided to order in.  Compared to most delivery restaurants of this style, we were happy not to get a salt bomb for a meal.  Only quibbles were ordering two larges and only getting one rice and their online menu not being accurate with regards to pricing.  Good flavor on the Kung pao.~~#~0
I made it to China King at 2:40 pm on a Sunday and I called ahead expressing a desire to have a late Dim Sum lunch. However, once we arrived they only had a five items to try. I was bummed, but I will make sure I go early next time so I can here what everyone raves about. My average Singapore vermicelli was a poor substitute, but I will arrive earlier next week so I don't interrupt staff meal. That seemed to be the focus when we there, as service was neglectful and quite indifferent.Also, I found a hair in my food, but why complain when they really don't care if you're there or not.~~#~0
Absolutely LOVE spicy pickle! Sandwiches are great (always make sure to get them HOT!) Pickles are awesome too! Food is consistent and really good. Good variety, and you can easily make your own sandwich with a ton of choices. Good breads, meats, cheeses, toppings, sauces. Overall a really good sandwich!~~#~1
Another 5 star review. I saw Beauty and the Beast with my little niece last night and she couldn't stop talking about it. (It was her reward for having good grades) I know I'm supposed to be the reviewing the theater, but I can't bring myself to rate them lower than 5. It was such a good show that even though there were a few minor issues at the theater,  they still deserve 5 stars. The auditorium is starting to show its age and hopefully they get the funding to make improvements. (Also some lady with a big head sat in front of us and my little niece couldn't see, so I changed seats with her.)  No big deal. Other than that the staff were very professional and helpful as always. Thank you again to yelp, Lindsey and to Gammage for giving us complimentary tickets. My little niece and I appreciates it and we enjoyed the show. :)~~#~1
I love Defalco's.  I hate Defalco's.  The food is always fresh and I'm never disappointed.  The big problem is that the service is so slow.  It's  great that they have a market for you to look around while you are waiting for your food.  I know I can get quality tasting food but I have to here when I know I'm not in a rush to be somewhere.~~#~0
This place is delicious. Great food and when they cook in front of you they do a lot of cool tricks and stuff. I would eat there everyday if I could afford it.~~#~1
We love 5th and Wine and recommend it to anyone that asks, the appetizers and wine specials for Happy Hour are some of the best in town. Let's start off with the fact that every glass of wine on the wine list, that's right every glass, is just $5 during Happy Hour from 3 - 6 pm.Did someone mention appetizers? Yep, 5th has you covered there too. Ever tried Fried Pickles? Love them! But I have to admit it took some convincing to win us over... thanks Scott! The fried pickles are thinly cut, fried to perfection and served with a creamy horseradish sauce for dipping.But what 5th and Wine is really known for at Happy Hour is their Bruchetta. They have 6 types to try but may we recommend this selection of our favorites: Apple and Brie; Tomato, Basil and Mozzarella; and the Steak and Horseradish. It's a great threesome! As someone mentioned last night, the bread is not too hard, very flavorful and toasted just right.Read the entire review here... http://schmoozeaz.com/blog/?p=680~~#~1
This was one of my favorite places to get take out pizza and salad from on a weekly basis.  Unfortunately, it looks like they have closed their doors.  I have tried calling for the past week and no one answers the phone.  I finally drove past the location and there is a note on the door stating they did not fulfill their rent payments.  I am only giving this place a 3 star because of utter disappointment, otherwise the food earns 5 stars!The Gluten Free cheese pizza was the best gluten free pizza I had ever tasted.  They used a thin rice crust with organic tomato sauce and low fat mozzarella cheese.  The place was small inside and lacked much ambiance, but made for a great delivery/ to-go restaurant.  I will miss you Z Pizza!~~#~0
very wonderful and romantic place to take your loved one :)~~#~1
Had lunch here a couple of days ago.  Place was dead.  Only one other table had people at it.  Service was quick.  Reuben sandwich I ordered was delivered promptly.  Meat was tasty but not exactly plentiful (I'm used to a New York style Reuben - with loads of meat).  Potato salad that came with the sandwich was very good, a pleasant surprise.  Outdoor seating was nice, though the birds did get tiresome.  Place seemed clean.  Plenty of seats.  Upstairs deck area would be great in the evening.  Seems like it would be a much more fun place with a group of people for happy hour  or dinner than it was for lunch.  Bottom line - it was okay.  Not bad, not great.  I'd give it another try but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again.~~#~0
Yes, as the other reviewers have stated, there are always extremely long lines and surly attendants at this location.  However, they have two automated machines where you can do almost everything you need to do without interacting with a human at all.  The machines are super easy to use and you can pay by credit card and it just prints out your label.  Not all post offices have these so it is a definite plus.Also, if you have pre-paid envelopes or just regular stamped letters, there is a drive thru when you pull into the parking lot where you can go and just drop them in the boxes without even getting out of the car.  I know that you could take these items anywhere but I have found that they get where they are going at least a day faster by dropping them at this post office since it is the main sorting facility for our zip code.  Very important when you are a Netflix addict.~~#~0
I dropped in to @SweetRepublic, finally, because they tweeted about their Chocolate Guinness, and a limited edition Jameson Irish Cream.I have had their ice cream in the past, both from the truck, and at other events, and was already a fan.Now, I'm fanatical.The Jameson was amazingly good! I couldn't believe how well the flavor was represented, without having the harshness of the alcohol bite.But the Chocolate Guinness won the day. It was so good, I ordered a pint to take home. (Unexplainably, it is still in the freezer. I will remedy that today!)The location is right by my work, so I anticipate returning, again and again.Jan and Helen are wonderful girls, and they have created something truly amazing. I congratulate them, and look forward to more of their creations.And their commitment to using local ingredients makes me happy to spend my money there, rather than a chain, who doesn't concern themselves with the area.~~#~1
I've got alot of nice and not-so-nice things to say about Phoenix's latest venture into building serious public transportation.Nice Thing #1: Mainly because it's new, the cars are really clean. After living in LA and using the metro subway there, anything seems cleaner than that. Let's just hope they keep up the cleanliness of the light rail in the years to come.Nice Thing #2: It gets me from A to B with little to no problems. It gets the job done. Also, it's one of Phoenix's more serious efforts at going green, so it's worth backing.Nice Thing #3: All of the current downtown stops are well thought out. Once you step off, something is always walking distance.Nice Thing #4: The price of the all-day pass is worth it.Nice Thing #5: Unlike public transportation in LA, the light rail is generally on time and makes for a reliable means of getting around. There don't seem to be any car companies that are trying to choke-hold the city by shutting any stations down like they did in the 30's in LA.The cons...Bad Thing #1: The only logic in taking the light rail is that it's essentially a car you don't have to park or fill up on gas. It's not that it's slow, but it really only goes slightly faster than the cars driving next to it in the street. Part of the sluggishness of the light rail stems from the fact that it has to stop at traffic lights like the cars you decided not to drive. I think the smarter idea would've been to build the light rail above or under ground so it could have gone faster and not have to stop at lights or risk the chance of some idiot gunning it and T-boning one of the passenger cars.Bad Thing #2: I know this experiment is still in its training wheels stage, but I really wish that they would build a line that would go to North Phoenix, Scottsdale, or Glendale. I've heard that they are planning a Glendale route, but that's probably going to take another ten years. Even though I live a few blocks from one of the stops, I really wish I wasn't limited to downtown, Tempe, or Mesa.Bad Thing #3: No airport stop? I mean, there is, but you have to take a shuttle to the actual airport. Why not just build a stop there? It would make more sense.Bad thing #4: Why does this thing shut off at 11? Is Phoenix trying to kill any chance of building a real nightlife downtown? We're not children. This city shouldn't set a curfew before midnight on this.In all, the Valley Metro Rail is more yay than nay. It's got its kinks that it still needs to work out and it's kinda tough to judge something that's in what I hope is a very nascent form of what it will eventually become.~~#~0
For some reason this reminds me a bit of Dukes in Waikiki. Food is OK, not bad, not good either. Service is OK, not bad, not good. The best part about this place is that they don't have a cover and its easy to get into. Its good for a beer on a pub crawl or to sober up for a couple of hours b4 2am. One of my coworkers literally drops $100's here per week and I don't think hes ever gotten a free beer. I think that says something about the place.~~#~0
A decent southwestern restaurant if you have a hankering for it.  The margarita was good and the Taos combo was also good.  The service was attentive and bumped this up to a three star review.  Otherwise, the food is good not great.~~#~0
Tasty fair trade organic coffee and breakfast and lunch.Even have almond milk! Excellent choices.Super nice people.Comfortable space.Let's help support these independent shops who exude caring, quality and individuality to thrive in our community!~~#~1
The Great Indoors is a phenomenal place to get lost and dream about what you would like to have your home look like.  WARNING!!!  You will want to spend money!On average their prices are pretty run of the mill dept. store style, it is their selection that is amazing.  They have far more selection than any other store I have ever been to.  The store is also well organized and laid out and everything is easy to find.One final note, while not a place for extreme bargain hunters if you play your cards right you can get some great deals.  I just purchased all of our appliances for our home at a 20% discount.  Again, not the best discount I have seen but getting them all at once, not having to look around, and still getting $2 back for every $10 I spend is pretty darn nice!Oh and if you need appliances, ask for Andy/Andrew... He is a great help and honest as can be!~~#~1
Lots of awesome stores! Expensive and normal price...it is an indoor mall.  Has Starbucks and a Tiffanys...my two favorites!~~#~1
New owners are awesome!!!!!  Good people, earnest in providing a great product with great service.  The restaurant is beautiful too.  My mouth starts watering right when I walk in the door.  Go check them out!!!!~~#~1
Another excellent find in Scottsdale.  The service is wonderful and the food is extremely flavorful with good size portions.  The sea scallops and herb chicken are highly recommended.~~#~1
Absolutely fabulous espresso place! The owner and staff are gracious and friendly, but most importantly they get coffee! I didn't have to explain how to make an espresso macchiato -- they just made it perfectly! I'll be here every time I visit Chandler!~~#~1
What a crap airline!  If I could give them zero stars I would.  I flew from Phoenix to Denver to New Orleans.  The check-in people, gate staff and flight attendants were rude and abrupt, the flights ALL left at least 45 minutes late, it was the worst flying experience I've had.  I was fortunate thta my Denver back to Phoenix leg was US Airways...never thought I'd say "Thank you US Airwarys" for at least that part of the flight not being a nightmare!  I will never fly United again!~~#~1
This is one of my favorite theaters.With that said, I suggest you prepare yourself for having to wade through an onslaught of pre-teen cliques if you plan on making your way to the ticket counter on a Friday or Saturday evening.If you're like me, safety is a concern.  Not to worry here.  I've always seen an officer on premises during the main drop-the-kids-off / pick-the-kids-up window.This location still has a new feeling to it, and it is clean and cool.  Nice cushy seats with cup holders, and I have yet to hear the soles of my shoes stick to the floor as I walk down an aisle.My favorite seats are the ones with the railing in front.  A place to perch my feet.-Swoop~~#~1
Oh, Sushi Brokers...what happened to you?! This used to be my go-to place for great ambience and delish sushi.  We ate there Friday night for the first time in a long time and they have significantly raised their prices and the sushi was subpar at best! $90 for 3 rolls and 3 cocktails. Grrrr....frustrating!~~#~0
This place is a bit difficult to find granted but well worth the effort. If you're shopping down at the farmer's market, need a place to study, or just want to plop down with a good book, Fair Trade will caffeinate you as well as  feed you such tasties as quiches, stuffed croissants, cookies, bagels, and sandwiches.  The cafe was run by the church up until Julyish in answer to Mr. K's musing but they've been bought by a few of the regular customers and are enjoying a slow but steady revitalization along with a steady extension of hours.  They're also hopefully expanding they're menus to include more food food items as volume picks up. Additionally, they offer only fair trade coffee and teas so you can do your part to help fair trade just by sipping at a cup of coffee.~~#~1
These are absolutely my favorite donuts in the whole wide world!!! No offense to those Krispy Kreme lovers out there but I think Lamar's has them beat! Their donuts are always so fresh and delicious! My absolute favorite is the chocolate iced cake donut with m&m's. Just thinking about them is making me salivate! ;-)!! I suggest getting there earlier rather than later because sometimes they sell out of certain varieties.~~#~1
This is definitely not your typical run of the mill nightclub. First off, let me mention that the decor is gothic cathedral style complete with erotic art, bright lights, and a chandelier over the bar. There is a unisex bathroom that is very clean and surprisingly never awkward. The music on Saturday nights for Doom Disco is an amaazing mix of old and new (think Joy Division and She Wants Revenge). Plus, the bartenders can make a mean gin and tonic and they have a pretty well stocked bar for any other drinks you might fancy. Tip: Doom Disco also has a Facebook page where they post pictures and the playlist from the Saturday before. Check it out!Overall, it's 100% worth the drive and $5 cover~~#~1
Very small selection. I am used to seeing a larger inventory of fine dresses and only found one that was nice! I also felt like I was maneuvering through an obstacle course with all the people in there and the poor arrangement; this is a messy and busy store.~~#~0
Okay, it's a nice place but I'm not sure I would drive out of my way to go here. I was in town on business staying nearby and thought I'd give them a try. The food was good, but not great. The shredded beef taco was typical and the shredded pork burrito tasted more like beef. The red chili sauce had an okay flavor but the heat level seemed to simply over power everything (and I like hot). The restaurant is very nice inside, very upscale. I guess if you wanted to spend alot for a Mexican dinner in a very nice setting this would be the place. Service was so so, maybe it was because I was a party of one. Whatever the reason, it wasn't a happening thing. Hey, at least the salsa was tasty.~~#~0
Contemporary atmosphere.  Good range of Italian offerings.  Attentive wait staff.  Portions generous.  Price reasonable.  Food fine.  I'd go again.~~#~0
Definitely one of my new favorite restaurants!A friend and I went to lunch there last week and it was even better than I expected after reading the other reviews.  The menu is EXTREMELY extensive.  The b-fast all day long is a plus, but I wasn't in the mood for that this time so I stuck to the lunch menu.  I ended up ordering the half sandwich and soup of the day and my friend and I split a side order of sweet potato fries.  The eggplant and roasted veggie sandwich was really good, but huge and messy!  I ended up eating a lot of bread and then eating the insides that fell out with a fork after wards.  Delicious nonetheless.  The homemade chicken noodle soup was outstanding!  It had lots of other bits of veggies that are not traditionally in the soup (red pepper, green pepper, corn, etc.) and it added to the soup quite nicely.  Did I forget to mention it's a GIGANTIC bowl of soup?  There's no little cup o' soup here - come hungry!  The fries were delicious although we didn't even need them since our meals were "Hungry Man" sized.Some side notes:1.  Parking is awful for lunch.  If you don't mind creepily stalking folks in the parking lot and possibly engaging in an altercation with another patron attempting to park, go ahead and give it the good ol' college try.2.  I ordered a water with lemon.  I received a water with no lemon.  When I asked for some lemons for my water, they brought me out a small plate with SIX (yes, I really did say six) overgrown lemon wedges.  I tried to come up with a scenario where one person would possibly have a need for one entire lemon on steroids.  I couldn't come up with one.  There is no reason for one person to be in possession of that much lemon.  Period.3.  We walked in and staff #1 seated us.  Staff #2 took our order.  Staff #3 brought our drinks and later the pile of lemons.  Staff #4 brought our meal.  Staff #5 cleared our plates.  Staff #6 brought our check.  Staff #3 took our check and brought the receipts/change back.  Did it really take 6 people to get us through a weekday lunch?  I was mostly entertained by it - it almost became a game of "who will show up next and what is their task?"  It was still a little ridiculous.4.  Being a semi-health conscious diner, I loved that they had fat free dressings, made tuna salad with low fat mayo, and just had many, many more healthy options than the average restaurant.  I appreciate places that can fix a good meal without drenching it in calories and fat.  There are plenty of places to go for that sort of meal when you're in need.  No shortage there.  It's nice to have those options beyond the standard no dressing, burger wrapped in lettuce, or vegetable medley consisting of zucchini, carrots, and cauliflower.  A big up for Taylor's.5.  For a half sandwich with soup, half of the fries, tax, and tip I paid about $16.  It's not the cheapest lunch in town, but it's worth what you pay for.  Just remember that the portions are gargantuan so no need to order a lot of extras to fill you up.I will definitely be back again.  Enjoy!~~#~1
I went to Kens Nails on Tatum a couple weeks ago and finally found my go-to nail place! The staff was friendly and helpful and it's a nicely decorated spa. I went in to get a mani/pedi and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of service. Mandy was my manicurist and she was wonderful. I got the gel nail manicure which was only $30 and the spa pedi which was only $32 and amazing! I am looking forward to going back.~~#~1
If I could give zero stars, I would.  I have never spent more time looking for a bar than I have looking for this. And not like a cool underground dance club in L.A.  When we finally found this sh*thole sandwiched between two vacant businesses, it was barely visible.  The sign for it looked like it was written with a sharpie on a piece of cardboard and someone duct tapped a flashlight to it.  Before we even entered the bar, as my friend and I were walking up two redneck bikers whispered, "Fags" as we walked by them.  I don't think these were the kind of guys you argued with so I let it go.  When we entered the bar I noticed several "No firearms" signs plastered on the walls.  I'm assuming they've had a problem with this before.  Remember that scene in the Blues Brothers where they go to the country bar and get the look of death from the patrons?  That's how I felt.  The decor of this bar was interesting.  It looked as if they got the tables and chairs from an old 70s Vegas casino.  The place is about the size of a small apartment's living room so getting a seat is pretty much impossible.  We went to the bar to do some karaoke, but apparently they also sell crappy jewelry for some reason?  Weird.  I've also never heard so much cussing from karaoke singers.  One of the drunken hicks actually got into a shouting match with one of the morbidly obese toothless tattooed bicker chicks where they argued who was the bitch and who was the pussy.  Halfway through my beer, my friends showed up and they refused to go inside so I ran away and never looked back.  TIP: If you go here wear a black leather jacket, bandana and Harley Davidson gear.~~#~1
In my effort to live and love local, I try to show Bashas some love since they are a locally owned chain. Everything about this Bashas is just OK. The produce, inventory and service are all par but nothing stands out. I recently bought several baked goods from this Bashas for an event. I was on the hunt for sugar cookies that Santa's little elves could decorate during a shopping crawl. They didn't have any out, so I asked the lady behind the counter. She told me they had cookies in the back for a dollar a piece. This was too high for my budget so I politely declined. Then a couple minutes later, she came back and told me they were actually on sale and only $.50, so I decided to buy them. Coincidence that I said no to cookies for a $1 and then they became 50 cents, or just oversight by the employee? Who knows.... During my visit, I also purchased some donuts. I need two dozen donuts and unfortunately they don't have donuts by the dozen pre-made so I ended up making my own. While this is good because you can choose your own, I think it would also be helpful to have pre-made dozens for those in a huge hurry (like I was that day). In summary, this Bashas is just OK, but I love supporting local so I will continue to shop here!~~#~0
Having worked in the Scottsdale Airpark area going on 9 years or so, I've eaten lunch just about everywhere. There are plenty of good places, but not many ethnic places... Indian Paradise has the distinction of being both great and ethnic. I've only ever eaten there for the lunch buffet, and it is AMAZING!I keep thinking that I'm gonna be disappointed, eventually... But every single time I have dined here I have come away extremely satisfied and in dire need of a nap. I keep asking myself, how can it be so good? Is it cocaine? Cocaine in the food?! Is it?!They have different buffet items on different days, but the the mainstay curry chicken remains a favorite of mine. On Friday there is a mushroom dish that I dream about... and on Thursday they have stuffed jalapenos that are a little hot but oh so gooooooood!Be sure to save some room for the rice pudding, 'cause it's delicious.~~#~1
Just so you are aware, phone calls are now 50 cents for 3 minutes. So proclaims the hand scrawled sign behind the bar next to the register. Even dive bars need a bit of order amongst the chaos.Ducked in here for a cold one after walking the fest in Melrose, I'm just a sucker for a dive bar. Once my eyes adjusted to the darkness, I saw an amazing mix of people. Some almost hipsters, Indians and traditional barflys. The Dos Equis was frosty and cheap, there was a back door for quick getaways or for smoking. Times truly are tough as I noticed on a trip to the men's room that three of the flys were passing around a hand made cigarette.~~#~0
NOCA...  wow.Have you seen the outer limits show where the chef owns a device that when placed in a small room with a single person drives the person completely insane with fear but creates a liquid extract that adds complete and utter bliss to food.  That liquid is then added to  the restaurant's soup which is revered as the best soup in the word.  Limit 1 bowl per person...?NOCA must have gotten their hands on this relic.  Honestly.  This has probably been the best dining experience of my life.   Everything was delicious on its own, all together, or when combining just a few of the items on the plate.  Walked in and our server seated us.  They brought us an amuse-bouche that had a small amount of blue cheese, chorizo, and chives.  Was delicious.  Then bread was served. After that, our Bacon and Egg was served.  This was phenomenal.  A crispy perfectly poached egg with oh so tender pork belly....mmmmMy fiance ordered the butternut squash cannelloni and I ordered the duck.  Both were amazing.  The duck was so moist and tender but not greasy at all.  We then were served cotton candy as we waiting on our 2 desserts to arrive.  We had the donuts and the de-constructed cheesecake.  I had an espresso and my fiance had the vanilla malted milk shake.All of this was amazing.  My fiance wasn't in the mood for wine, so I delved into the beer list and low and behold, 90 minute IPA from dogfish head.... NOCA, I love you.~~#~1
ALTERNATIVE!!That's what this place is and in the land of BIG chains, this only could add some spice. We were welcomed here to the free screening of Dale and Tucker Vs Evil as part of a Yelp event. The personnel is totally committed to their project. If you are looking some retro movies or the gender I don't enjoy (but others do - horror), this is a good alternative.~~#~1
This is just like Filiberto's. Fast-food mexican food. It's really good and taste pretty authentic to me. My hubby and I stopped in for a quick bite to eat and we went there because he heard it was good from his co-workers. I'm a huge critic of mexican rice and beans and this place has it down. I got the lunch special of the day which was 2 bean tostadas with beans and rice. It was sooo much food and I was so stuffed!  Next time I will get something smaller. You can't beat all that food for $5! They have a good salsa bar with all the fixings!~~#~0
Dr. Lee does excellent work and he and the staff are very friendly and professional.  The best dental care I have ever received and I have lived all over the country and grew up at the dentist with my bad teeth.  They work very well with children also.~~#~1
It's a Japanese fast food. I'm very impressed with the service, the owner spent some times to greet everyone. I ordered beef bowl teriyaki but the beef teriyaki is a lil bit over cooked and the smell of the burning beef just overwhelmed me. The Panko breaded fish plate is the one that I recommend to try. They also have the seaweed salad which I found good. And they also charged for the soda refill $.30~~#~0
This place has it all. Fresh food. Vintage decor. Outdoor misting system for those uncomfortabley-sweaty summer days. Plenty of scooter parking. Beautiful shade trees (watch out for scorpions!). Oh and did I mention the food?My favorite item by far has to be the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich. Tender grilled chicken breast smothered in tangy wing sauce nestled between a toasty bun that has been smeared with blue cheese and crunchy celery. It's heaven in a bite.Coupled with a serving of Sweet Potato Fries, this is a party in your mouth and every taste bud is invited. (Even that anti-social one on the back of your tongue that doesn't know how to dance.)~~#~1
Pretty good mexican grub in the 480.I had two carne asada tacos and a chile rellano plate.The meat in the tacos was tender, tasty and plentiful, accompanied by chilantro, onion and hot sauce - typical ingredients but done right.The chile rellano had a flavorful red sauce, the batter was not too soggy, the chile was cooked well (not crunchy/underdone, not squishy/overcooked) and the cheese oozed out when the chile was cut into.  This dish came with the standard rice and beans, neither of which was remarkable in any way shape or form.Minus two big stars for what they consider guacamole.  It wasn't thick, it had no taste and it seemed as though this vital mexican staple was merely there as a garnish.  No bueno.  If it ain't green, thick and tasty, you better hit the drawing board.Ya feel me?~~#~0
After reading about all the other Phoenix coffee establishments that had either come and gone, or were serving bad Costco coffee we were thrilled to find White Sage Espresso!  The coffee was some of the best I've had in a long time!  Our visit was such a pleasure on so many levels and we couldn't wait to go back the next day.  First besides the fabulous coffee, we were amazed by the multidimensional flavors in the spinach cheese quiche, usually I'm not a big quiche fan but my husband is so we tried it and I think I could eat it all day long it was so good!Next, while we finished the quiche a batch of fresh blueberry muffins came out of the oven and the owner gave us a piece of one and again, amazing multidimensional flavors!  We had one of our own and took one to our friends who raved about it also.After that as we chatted with Wes, the owner, we discovered that he and my husband had gone to the same high school in Southern California, another fun surprise to our visit to White Sage Espresso.And the last thing that really set White Sage apart from the average coffee shop is Wes is also a physic/medium.  I had such a great feeling after chatting with Wes during our visit I decided to schedule an appointment with him.  I have been to several other physics before but Wes brought something to my reading that I had never experienced before, I really enjoyed it, and I will definitely be in contact with Wes again in the future for another reading.I look forward our next visit to White Sage Espresso!~~#~1
I was at Liberty Market this morning for breakfast. The grilled bread pudding is amazing. And the bathrooms are so adorable!~~#~1
Service was fast and friendly, the mixed drinks are great!  We went on a busy Friday night and a lot of family's where there.  They have a man walking around making balloon figures.  The slide/ stairs is a great touch for kids.  The food was OK, nothing outstanding.The view was amazing, it overlooks the entire city.~~#~0
Everytime I have gone in this store I have left feeling like a big pile of poop. The staff is sooo horrible. I read the other reviews and it seems to be a common thing which really sucks because I would probably shop here a lot more if the staff wasn't a bunch of pricks. P.S. I found a skirt at Target for $10 that is EXACTLY like one they carry, except they want $40 dollars and your soul.~~#~1
My fiancé took his pediatric boards yesterday and that calls for a no-more-studying-at-coffee-shops-during-dinner celebration! We are brand new to Phoenix and these last few months have been eating lots of Mexican and some more Mexican, which we are not complaining about in the least, but it was time for something different. Our neighbor recommended Richardson's/Rokerij as his favorite so I made a reservation for Monday night.We sat in their downstairs dining room tucked in a generous booth in the back corner. My fiancé ordered a Dark and Stormy and we split a bottle of Pinot Noir as our server informed us of their 1/2 price bottles of wine deal. Hurrah! We ordered 2 appetizers: the bacon-wrapped scallops and the crab-stuffed mushrooms. One bite of the scallops and we were in heaven. They were GIANT, perfectly cooked, and beautifully placed in a pool of amazingly different dipping sauces. You can never go wrong with wrapping bacon on a piece of, well, anything, but this appetizer was magical.My fiancé ordered the Rokerij Steak with roasted corn and mashed sweet potatoes in a chili pepper. I'm not a steak lover, but took one bite of his dish and it melted in my mouth. Fantastic. I ordered the Swordfish special with roasted eggplant and mashed sweet potatoes in the chili pepper as well, and I devoured every bite! What did it for me, however, was the dessert. We shared the truffle with vanilla gelato topped with berries. The truffles were like buttery brownies in a hard shell and perfectly portioned to satisfy. Very memorable. We will be back, even if it's just for the truffles!~~#~1
About 1.6 miles roundtrip from the Maricopa Ramada.  Pretty cool little climb, but then you end up on a road heading to the summit.  Near the top, you get to go offroad for a bit to the very top.  You can see 7th St go all the way downtown.Total time up and back was 50:12.  Pretty easy hike.  This was my third of four mountains, one Saturday in April.~~#~0
This place is the least douche-filled club of the douche tour in downtown Scottsdale. It is a huge club and in some ways it's like an anchor store in a mall - like Dillards or JC Penny. You can get a little bit of everything you want in one place... It's got its share of plastics and douchebags, but also has a number of college kids venturing away from Tempe to go dancing. The place itself is kinda cool with various rooms of different themes and a good sized dance floor. The VIP area upstairs is pretty neat if you can swing the fee. They have the requisite go-go dancers with giant boots on some nights and they often feature good local dj talent.I haven't had to wait in line to go here in years because I'm always invited to go - I reckon if I had to wait in line, I'd just not go. Don't buy a girl a drink - apparently, this place attracts some pretty (when it's dark) homeless alcoholics. These girls need jobs (and not boob jobs - that's already been covered). Myst is large enought that you can go here and manage to find a good time... drinks are a bit pricey, but that's par for the course in the area. It's a one-stop-shop for all your drinking and dancing and scamming needs. You're also very close to a slew of other smaller clubs of the same sort if Myst isn't happening.One of the best parts is that it's across the way from a pizza by the slice place that stays open after hours just to feed the drunk idiots so they can "sober up" for the drive home. Sometimes I go here around 2am sober just to people watch... on any given night, you're likely to see either a fight break out, some drunk chick puke on her hair, or someone crying over something stupid. You also get to see everyone in the harsh fluorescent lights not looking their best - the shine and polish is gone from their outfit and the product in their hair has quit on them and the girls' makeup has given up long ago - plus, they are too drunk to suck in that gut or push out that chest. It's very amusing.Yes - Myst is a good place to go if you want to go clubbing in Scottsdale - send your out-of-town friends here... locals who aren't into the scene will loath it. I pretty much do.~~#~0
I work in the area and come here maybe once a month when I have a pho craving and need a place near work.  The decor is relaxing, and the music is pleasant.  I find service to be fast which is really important during lunch.On one side, the prices are a little on the high side, and the pho is somewhat bland.  On the other side, a lot of my American coworkers won't go to a mom and pop pho house.  Pho Dalat is somewhere they would be okay with.If you're on that side of town.. have a pho craving.. then Pho Dalat will definitely cure that.. but don't get expected to be wow'ed by the complex flavors of the broth~~#~0
I am so loyal to Durant's that I feel like a heel...but City Hall was divine.  Steaks, sides, drinks...the only thing we didn't have was dessert...but $1100 later, who could afford it?~~#~1
Great fresh food and vegetarian options! I will definitely return!!~~#~1
I've been wanting to try this place for awhile after hearing good things about it and reading the menu. I realize now why the website doesn't list prices-- the mission is hideously overpriced!We ended up on the patio since they weren't seating in the main area yet (at 6:30pm? For reals?) Our waitress was nice and attentive. She noticed my water had something floating in it and replaced it quickly. My husband's water glass was dirty too. She brought us out two sample size frozen peach and strawberry margaritas which were awesome. Much better than the rocks margarita.No complimentary chips and salsa which would be ok if they offered something else like Barrio. No happy hour either which was disappointing.The street corn was good, but I've had much better. The butternut squash tacos were out of this world. My husband liked them better than his mahi tacos. I just can't believe they have the gall to charge $12 for 3 tiny (3 inches in diameter) tacos. They also charge $12 for guac made from 2 avocados. I'm not sure how they have survived in this economy. They must be very slow when the tourists leave for the summer.~~#~0
Sadly, I'm giving this place one star and an explanation why it is only getting one star.  The Manger/operator guy.Sure, the food here isn't all that bad.  Probably a half a notch or so higher than most of the hot slop fast food you can get for lunch.  Most of the crew members are pretty attentive, don't seem to be meth addicted, and I see them cleaning the tables on a regular basis.  Looks like the crew changes over quite often, and I know why.My beef is not with the crew members, oh no.  Not with the food or cleanliness of the store.  Nope.  The Manager guy, the guy who looks like a real pussy version of John Leguizamo.  This guy ruins about every trip I have to this joint.  That is my problem with this joint.  Elaboration will proceed now.This guy is without a doubt one of the biggest assholes I have ever encountered in the fast food industry.  Actually, one of the biggest assholes period.  What a douche bag.  Seems like any time I have a coupon, this guy will literally butt in the middle of the order, give me a ration of shit and do about anything possible not to use it.  Seriously, what is it, 30 cents?  I had a store coupon that was on a tray liner a while ago and this nutsack got in the middle of the order, cancelled it and refused to let the coupon be used.  I asked why and he said it was not legit (why was it on the tray liner then fuckhead?) I checked the menu, they would have lost 10 cents.  Lady taking my order after P.J.L. (pussy John Leguizamo) walked away pretty embarassed said "sorry"  Not her fault.  Never saw her working there after then, was probably tired of that guys shit.  I don't blame you.Last trip here, they have promos on their drink cups for free shit.  Awesome.  We all know this is the garbage that costs them nothing but I am a sucker for something free.  On my trip before the last, I got one for a free corndog.  SCORE!  I cash it in on my last trip, and the guy ringing up the order said it would be on a different ticket.  No sweat, I could give a shit less as long as I get my corndog.  Go to get my order, ask where the corndog is.  P.J.L. butts in the middle of the order, says "This is your order, this is what you have" and was a fucking prick about it.  Me, the customer.  Yanks the receipt out of my hand, gives me an attitude about it.  Who the fuck talks to a customer like that, even at a low rent fast food joint?  Fuck you.  Seriously.  The guy who took my order tried to explain the situation and dicknose literally looks at him, puts his hand in front of the guys face, and says "ssssshhhhhh" and snaps his fingers the same way I do to my dogs to keep them barking or eating drywall.  Who degrades their employees like that?  All he was trying to do was explain my free item was on another ticket.  Instead of listening, he made a complete asshat out of himself.  It was a corndog, what does that cost you anyway, about 12 cents in batter, a stick, and a combination of horse eyeballs and badger penis meat?  Dude (cashier guy, tattoo on your arm), tell that guy to get fucked and get a better job.  No one deserves that shit.  I am actually ashamed I didn't say something for you, I truly am.What would have normally gotten a decent review is what it is.  My rant speaks for itself.  One shithead ruins it for the ones working for him.  For the ones working there, I will pray for you.  You need it.  P.J.L., get out of there and become a pimp in Tijuana, they need midget controlling assholes over there.  You would do great at that.~~#~1
Located along the infamous, gutted for future LRT, Central Avenue is Community ( you know, like rainbow community) Florist. Serving the sistahs for years is a helpful, friendly and knowledgable staff. Prices are well below the chain florists here in Central Phoenix and I always like to help the small business owner, especially during this construction madness. I've purchased flowers here that last well over a week. They also have an eclectic collection of vases, things for the garden, cards, etc. So if you're trying to woo that special someone, or perhaps you messed up with the mister or you simply wanna say to yourself, "I'm special. I like myself. I deserve tulips"....get on down to Community Florist. You know it's about time ya'll stop to smell the roses...~~#~0
Tried to eat here Friday night for the seafood buffet. We waited in line for 90 minutes before finally giving up. Would have been much sooner but the drive down there from my house is almost an hour. They have three lines, tiered based on the level of player's club card. The diamond card holders waltzed right in and the hostesses would seat from that line until it was empty before anyone from the 'lesser' lines would be seated. At the end, we stood still... didn't move an inch... for 20 minutes. So no-one from our line was seated for 20 minutes while dozens of people waltzed right through in the diamond and platinum lines. What a fucking joke. Waster my whole evening trekking down there dreaming of crab legs just to be snubbed by them.Never, EVER again.~~#~1
This place is kind of hidden and very quiet, but from the reviews it seems like they've got quite a few patrons! I thought the food was just okay... I've eaten here twice and I admit that the prices are excellent but unfortunately it's not enough to keep me coming back. Staff was pretty friendly, so I thought that was a plus.~~#~0
Angry Bro Bar !  Please go here if you wear size smedium affliction shirts you will love it. The bar is lame. Kid you not there was not five minutes that went by where two people didn't try and fight each other.~~#~1
I really didn't think this place was all that great.  None of the food that I ate was particularly very good.  I think the best thing I had were some sort of sweet and sour meatball things.  Everything was just hard, overcooked, or flavorless.  I wasn't really impressed with the options available either.The saving grace of this place is the BBQ station and the sushi bar.  The bbq looked 1000 times better than YC's Mongolian freeze-dried junk.  The sushi was decent too.  This place is just middle of the road for me.  I can't blame it for having over-cooked food...it's a buffet.  But still, I've had better.~~#~0
Whenever I get my car cleaned, this is the place that I'll always go to.  They're nice, efficient, and they do a great job.  My car is still shining a week later!The wait is very minimal.  The staff works together fantastically, and you can watch them clean your car so you don't have to worry about anything getting stolen.  Yeah it's a little small, and a bit shabby, but like the first reviewer said, you don't go there for the waiting experience!Definitely worth the money!~~#~1
I could spend hours in this place. In fact, I know I have. There are so many things to look at and it's way more than just books. They have a ton of cards and stationary as well as fun trinkets. If you're into used books, this is the place to go. I've found nearly mint condition vintage books here and they've made the perfect gifts. The people who work here are great as well. They're more than willing to help and offer good recommendations. This is a go to if you're looking for a good read or just want to pop in and explore.~~#~1
Food is great.  Really good deal, lots of tasty food for a great price.  My favorite combo is the Pulled Pork sandwich with side of Mac & Cheese & Coleslaw & Kool Aid.  Founded by former NFL & ASU Football player they know how to barbecue I truly recommend everyone trying it out.  The atmosphere is not that inviting yet the food is worth staying and will get you to come back I can guarantee,~~#~1
Yay!! This place is fantastic. Great pastries and atmosphere. I can't wait to go back.~~#~1
Typically I give a place that falls in the middle of great and bad multiple chances.  For whatever reason it's easier for me to 1, 4 or 5 star a place after the first visit, rather than 3.  As far as yelp is concerned, 3 stars isn't a bad thing - "A-OK."!The scene is strange.  It's a mix of typical Arcadia, Scottsdale and the like.  This place is more of a sports bar than anything, in my eyes, with better food than your typical sports bar fare.  Seriously.  There's like 14 televisions in here.Service is quick-ish.  Food is fresh.  The servings are very large.  Some things waver on decent-to-bland, while other things are pretty swell.  The mac & cheese is a pass, in my opinion, and not worth the $5 (for the small cup you get - ah, contradictory to my large servings note!).  Some dishes have an overpowering taste, while other leave you wondering if you're eating food or chewing crunchy water (that sounds gross now that I've typed it out!).Beer and liquor list is pretty typical; nothing to note really.  A few changes here and there and I could see it as a really decent spot.  The same could be said for the food, really.I'll be back, yet again, The Garage just hasn't blown me away yet.  Also, on a funnier note: "Garage" reads easily as "Garbage" on the menu, which was kind of comical.~~#~0
I think this place is hyped up a little more than it should be. I've tired their bruschetta, pizzas and salads. They were decent and I have no complaints but nothing to rave about. A decent place to pop in to for lunch since they have counter service that you order at.~~#~0
Gross, repulsive, appauling, disgusting, overrated, dirty, should be shut down by the CDC.  You get the jist?~~#~1
The guy who worked the front door Sunday night deserves to be fired. Sound harsh? Not at all. Had a supervisor overheard how he treated my friend he would have agreed.We pull up in the car.  It looks fine from the outside so we send in one of the five of us in to scope it out (check the menu, see if there's seating etc). Normal behavior. So my friend K, approaches the guy at the door and asks "what type of food is served here?" expecting a simple response like  "American" or "here let me grab you a menu."Ready for this...?? His response: "human food"HUMAN FOOD?!?!?!HUMAN FOOD!??!?!K is just an average potential customer, asking a fair easy to answer question.Okaaaaay. Being the sweetheart K is, she goes with it (it: him being a meeeeeanie) and asks if there is outdoor seating.He sarcastically, mockingly and and outright D-bagly points out how there is a seat yourself sign right nearby. How was this guy ever hired?Again a more appropriate responds (TOOL:) would have been "yea, the patio seems like it has some space tonight, AND I'D BE HAPPY TO GO CHECK FOR YOU" or "at this fine establishment it's seat yourself but usually the outside turns over quickly."  Sunday night's fine joke machine at the front door: I could happily give you several other decent responses you could have said to an innocent patron.Everyone and their mom has had some turn at being a waiter/hostess/manager/bartender etc etc in the food and hospitality industry, be it in AZ, SF, WHEREVER and KNOWS the #1 101 rule is: BE KIND TO THE GUEST(kiss@$$ , the customer is always right etc.)Add to that list: answer straightforward questions from your guests with flat out, non-acrimonious answers!Granted this review can say nothing about this establishement beyond the front door because we never made it that far.~~#~1
The food is solid, but not awesome.  The room is kind of ugly and occasionally not too fragrant.If you want Vietnamese, you want it dirt cheap and you want it now, this place gets it done.If you want a warm, memorable dining experience, this is not the place.~~#~0
Friendly reps, painfully high tire price quote.  Found em for $100 less, per tire while waiting for my car to be pulled up.~~#~0
My husband and I went tonight to teakwoods for the first time. We had a groupon. The place was packed.  Different football games going on tvs all over the place. I didn't mind, but my hubby was in heaven:)   Hostess told us every table was full except outside. So went outside, turned right around because I forgot about smokers, lol.    We waited about 1 min and the hostess asked us if we would mind sharing a table with another couple. We said sure.  There was 6 chairs  and 4 of us total so 2 empties inbetween us. It was same as if we had our own table. Worked out great:) We started off with the jess Jess boneless wings- Delish!!!!! Not wet like other wings in fact I think they coat them and then throw them on the grill. We Loved them!I ordered a southern thang burger - my  hubby got a Teaks touch ém all. They were huge!  We each ended up taking half home.  Not just huge but tasty. I loved mine.    We decided to pay and use the groupon another time to ensure we would remember to come back:)Great place- waitress nice and friendly, good food- we will eat there again!~~#~1
I've only flown in and out of Pheonix Airport through Southwest, so i've only been in one section of this airport- but it isn't that great. THe food choices are slim and none are fab- I mean, really what airport had fab food- wait DFW does! Anyway- the Sky Harbor does have is a great view and decently clean restrooms.~~#~0
Had lunch here with Robyn N. and Rand H. the food here was ok and I liked it better before they did the so called renovation.All they did was add a mongolian BBQ and wash the windows. Some of my favorite things on the buffet were gone so I am dropping them down to 3 stars but still it was a good lunch.~~#~0
I have been Chipotle faithful for about 2 years now, and it wasn't very difficult.  Restaurants such as Rubio's and the Blue Burrito just didn't stack up to a Chipotle burrito.  Then came Qdoba.This restaurant is pretty much a carbon copy of Chipotle (2 of the employees on duty actually worked at my former Chipotle of choice).  I had a chicken burrito (my Chipotle norm) so I could make as direct of a comparison as possible.  The food was great, and afterwards I didn't get that "punched in the stomach" feeling that Chipotle gives me for some time after I eat it (I am convinced their rice expands in your stomach, but it tastes good so I suffer through it).  I also picked up their frequent customer swipe card (buy 10 burritos get one free + free chips and salsa after activation).  This place is closer to my place than any Chipotle, so I will be coming very often! P.S. If anyone if privy to the correct pronunciation let me know!(ku-doh-ba???)~~#~1
first time here and i wasnt all that impressed. lets just say i was afraid to ask my waitress when she was due.. but thats beside that point. bunch of tvs tho i had to squint to see whats going on. my eyes arent that great but whatever.it was a wednesday so they had margaritas and mexi beers on daily special, which varies. had 3 margaritas fairly fast. felt nearly nothing. weak as hell. i expected to half stumble out of the place but really i was fine.decent selection of wing flavors. which i might start seeing as a bad sign. tried the El Heffe wings. dry and dusty but a decent taste, with no real kick like it says, except maybe in the stomach itself. and the extra dollar for them? shouldve been a dollar less.cant screw up peanuts. the peanut shells on the floor novelty was probably the best part of the place, because you cant be that messy anywhere else but a baseball game. thats an extra star in itself. the rest of the menu looked good so i may be back on a day with better drink specials and try something new to eat. ill update this shit if i do so......~~#~0
My review is only for the purchase of a non-disposable diaper at this swim school. As soon as I entered, I was promptly greeted and asked how they could help me. I explained that I was looking for a non-disposable diaper for my lil'un and they asked about weight etc and found the perfect one for her. The lady explained to me that the non-disposable diapers are so good that even if for some reason there is an accidental Code Brown, if you know what I mean, they will not charge their patrons. They really believe in the product that they sell. Their swimming pool looks nice and clean and this could really be a fun place for little kids. I know they do parent and child classes here also.~~#~1
Good works~~#~1
A great value for a far superior hair cut than are likely to get from a national chain.  We have been going to Tara for 3 years and she has created a warm and friendly environment that kids love.  There are plenty of TV's for kids to watch a show if they are not big fans of haircuts.~~#~1
I went here while on vacation visiting my friend. Neither of us had been there before, but I know they have lots of locations on the west coast, so we gave it a try. The staff was totally rude. Before we went, we called to check the hours. The guy on the phone was patronizing and acted inconvenienced to have to give any information. The pizza was blah - totally generic and nothing special. If you're going to have mediocre food, you better have exceptional service. Double fail.~~#~1
Always love it!! so good and good price~~#~1
This review is for the bar only.I had a date last week and was looking for a local bar to grab drinks at. I called Cycle on Wednesday and was told they would be open until at least midnight on Friday, and the guy was very nice. Friday arrives, and I take my date there, and when we enter the bar, the bartender makes a gas face and says they are closed for the night. I told her that I called just two days earlier and she just stared at me. No attempt at fixing anything, nada. One drunken patron at the bar yelled to open the bar back up, but I was over it. Well done cycle.~~#~1
This is a difficult review to write.  My family started eating here when they first opened. We were a once a week customer. Very happy with the food and service, pizza is delicious. Then one evening, we placed our order asking for the special we always get, a 2 pizza deal.When we received our order, they placed 2 medium pizzas on our table. I immediately asked about the pizza size as we had always received 2 large pizzas as advertised.  It turns out they have 2 specials, a 2 medium pizza deal and a 2 large pizza deal.The employee never asked which deal and the fact that we were there with 5 people should have prompted them to ask me to specify which deal.I spoke to the owner of this location he agreed to make us another medium pizza to make up the size difference to which I agreed to.Nearly 10 minutes later, the owner came to our table and told us that if he made us another pizza, he was going to have to charge us for it.I refused and now nearly 2 years later, we have chosen not to return to this establishment. My money is important to me and it should be as important to any business, especially a small local business...I now choose a place slightly further away, but one that appreciates its customers.Pizza - deliciousCustomer appreciation - needs improvementHope some changes have been made over the last couple of years~~#~0
While staying at The Pointe Hilton Tapatio, we decided to eat here for our anniversary dinner. To sum it up, I've had everything better somewhere else. Nothing blew my socks off. Hubby is eating mostly vegetarian right now (due to a health concern), and he did really like his "wild mushroom" rigatoni. We weren't sure what was so "wild" about criminis and portobellos, but the pasta was in a light sauce with plenty of other veggies. His French Onion Soup was better at Capital Grille, my antipasto plate was far better at Craftsteak, and my ribeye was far better at 1130. They did serve a neat wedge of au gratin potatoes- multiple paper thin cheesy slices cut into a triangle. The gins are standard, but Hubby had a nice Bonny Doon Riesling. The free anniversary creme brulee was on the runny side, the vanilla was indiscernible, and the sugar crust was too thick- Ruth's Chris still wins that one in my book. Did I feel dinner was worth $120? Not so much.The service at dinner was great, and it was fine at breakfast. Again, everything was decidedly mediocre and way overpriced. I've had a better Belgian waffle at IHOP, my bacon was limp, and the coffee not what I would expect from the Hilton. Hubby's BLT breakfast bagel was better.Come on, Hilton! Is this the best you can do?~~#~0
I've been to the Greene House many times. In general, I think it's pretty good. I go mostly for lunch, and I order from the sandwiches & salads typically.Tonight was no different - had a sandwich.I went with my brother as a belated bday celebration. Ordered the roast beef sandwich with a side salad instead of fries. Had the pineapple rum cake for dessert.The first few times I ate at the Greene House, I was really impressed. I thought the food and service was very good. Over time, I've become less impressed. Tonight, the service was great - loved my server. Everything worked like a well-oiled machine. Good coordination between the staff, and we were kept well supplied throughout dinner.The food is not consistent. That's a big issue I have with restaurants in general. Maybe I'm harsh, but I really believe being inconsistent knocks a place down a few notches. The problem with inconsistency is that you don't know what you're going to get. If a place is consistently mediocre, at least I know I'm going to get mediocre.Tonight the real downer to the whole meal was the salad. Don't get me wrong, the sandwich was not great either - bun too big compared to the amount of meat and other filling items on the sandwich, not enough meat - but the side salad was really awful. First, if I moved the salad on my plate, there was a big pool of dressing on my plate. There is such a thing as a properly dressed salad, and this was not it. Way too much dressing. I might have been ok with that had the dressing been very good... which it wasn't. The balsamic dressing was too sweet, and was under seasoned (definitely needed more salt).The dessert was good. It wasn't great... but it was good. The rum cake, in my opinion, was too dry. Maybe the ridiculously large scoop of gelato is supposed to compensate for that, but I'd prefer a more moist cake and less gelato. I'm also not a huge fan of places where the dessert is almost as big (if not bigger) than the entree. Give me a couple bites of something amazing rather than a huge plate of something mediocre. I felt that this dessert fell into the later category.I'm going to admit that this is only the second time I've ever had dessert at The Greene House, so I won't pass judgement on it's entire dessert menu, but I'll say the couple times I've been there, the dessert/entree ratio was way out of whack for my liking.~~#~0
This place has exceptional food and pretty great service for how busy it always is.I like it because there are quite a few vegetarian options.  Before I started my vegetarian kick the Baked wings were some of the best wings I have had anywhere.Try:- Mushroom Party Pizza- Roasted Corn Pizza- Baked Wings- Red Velvet CakeOnly con is the parking is kinda crazy.~~#~1
Okay... just let me say, these guys are the best! My family and I stayed in Scottsdale for 5 weeks this past summer and we frequented Baskin Robbins almost every single night. No kidding. And, yes, my butt thanks me not for such goings on. But at any rate, we have never met such a friendly ice cream staff. I am a PITA when it comes to ordering my ice cream -- I like jamoca ice cream with almonds mixed in, then I like my fudge on the side and I like extra fudge. This sort of ice cream order has raised a few brows, and furrowed some in the past, but not here, not these guys! And the couple of times, my rice-high (from the sushi place next door) son dropped his cone on the floor, they were so kind and understanding about it, they just scooped up the mess while they joked around with my little one about all the ice cream they've had to wipe off the floor in the past with other customers, and made him a fresh new cone, adding extra sprinkles, for good measure. Viola! No more tears and only big smiles from that moment on. They really are the best! I can't wait to visit them again! :)~~#~1
I'm giving this Urban a perfect rating, for it never fails that when I walk through its doors, I always find something I want (or could) buy - even if it's a gift for somebody else, like my younger sister or best bud in Detroit. I even found one of my favorite sweaters here on clearance for $20. I think this Urban has a better selection for women than the one in Tempe, so if I had my choice, I'd come here to browse and buy. Plus, it's within walking distance of Scottsdale Fashion Park, Borders and Olive & Ivy (the perfect spot for brunch/lunch).~~#~1
Wanting to purge my guilt for constantly demanding one of my suburban friends to come downtown whenever we go out, I recently dragged another CenPho friend out to suburbia so we could pay him a visit in his homeland for once. San Tan Brewery was our chosen destination.Will I ever come out here again? No, unless guilt once again consumes me.  Would I come back if I lived in Chandler? Sure. (What choice would I have?) The food (an Aegean Stuffed Burger with fries) was good. The beer was even better. The service was annoyingly slow due either to understaffing or inattentiveness. The crowd was large and the place was packed when we arrived around 9:30, but at 11:30 (on a Friday night) it completely cleared out.~~#~0
This place is a freaking joke. Expect an overcrowded waiting room and at minimum an hour wait. They see children but there is nothing in the waiting room to entertain them so they are all screaming and crying. There's not even room for a stroller. Horrible, horrible experience!~~#~1
Saw this place on Triple D so I decided to give her try. My expectations were high and when I arrived I was shocked that on a Thursday morning the line was extra extra long. Had to wait patiently which when it comes to food I don't like. But needless to say the wait was worth it because when I got in there I was served quickly. I ordered the pork chop, eggs, and hash browns.  The pork chop there is fabulous and the toast and home made grape jelly was good. I would recommend this place for breakfast to anyone who is in the downtown area of Phoenix. Make sure to try the bacon too.~~#~1
Awesome location, cool place....the Chopped Salad is by far the most amazing salad I have ever had in my life (but way...and I mean way to small)...If it were double the portion for the price I would probably visit more. I had a flight when I was there...it took forever (as I know flights are supposed to)...but this was ridiculous...the buffalo meat is so gross...it reminds me of when a stray dog visits my lawn...The BBQ sauce is good....the staff is just OK. Nothing mind blowing. I think staff in a place with a pricey menu should spoil the guests a bit...Give away a free desert when you know the service and meal is just OK...this may bring your customer base back to visit just because you redeemed yourself at the end.Overall its a cool place. It fits with the downtown Scottsdale lifestyle. But stay away from the buffalo, because it will give doggy bag a whole new meaning....~~#~0
I love the clothes and accessories, the staff is friendly and the prices accomodate everyone!~~#~1
Huge line for incompetent employees who don't even know how to wash cars.~~#~1
I`ve had work done by this shop a few times thruoghout the past few years. My latest experience was when my sons car broke its timing belt and needed substantial repairs. Bob informed us that he could move the car out of the way in his lot to be safely stored until we decided whether we wanted to fix it or not. This is just one of the reasons why I`ll always bring my business to him.~~#~1
This place has been here 7 years and we have never been. Are you kidding me? The food is excellent. The people who work here are friendly and seem to be happy to be there, which is most important. I tried the make your own half salad and half sandwich. YUMMY!!! There are many choices for salad toppings. There us nothing I like more than a huge, fresh salad. I chose to top my salad with avocado, tomato, bacon, edemame, feta cheese, and whipped balsamic vinaigrette. I really think this was the best salad I have ever had! They make the salad in front of you and mix in the perfect amount of dressing. I chose the chicken pesto sandwich. The combo of these items was a perfect portion for this hungry girl. The sandwich was excellent. My hubby ordered the Cuban pork sandwich. This is one huge sandwich! It was difficult to get his mouth around it, but once he did, it was awesome!! Typically, we don't like coleslaw, but it was really good, especially combined with the tender pork. We will return to the Market Bistro, again and again. Loved it!!!!~~#~1
In being a bit of a burrito man, I was suspicious that a torta could ever marvel a tortilla filled with meat.  However, all of the hype on yelp and man vs. food was appropriate, as the torta provided a massive yet tasty introduction to pork, turkey, guacamole, and a bunch of other hidden great tastes all in one sandwich.  The carne asada quesadilla blew us away-- HUGE in portion, amazing meat, and super flavorful.  I was also glad to be one of the few gringos in this place.  People were friendly toward us in any case.  Check out the horchata for some authentic aguas frescas...~~#~1
Fair and honest prices.  Friends and I have been ripped off by other companies for the last several years wondering if there was anyone honest left.  During the summer, you're at the mercy of the air conditioning techs and usually they take advantage of it.I'm very happy with their service.  Very prompt and professional.   Father and son make a great team.Great warranty service.  An electronic part he installed died after 3 weeks.  He came out immediately and replaced the item for no charge.~~#~1
go to the reverse happy hour where reasonably edible sushi is served at reasonable prices amidst, in the instance of our  visit, barely legal drinking aged crowd. in a mall. nuff said.~~#~0
So yummy! Strange combination but great place~~#~1
I absoloutely love this place.  Great Coffee, Americanos, and Lattes.  Try the Chemex if you are looking for something unique.  Very Tasty Breakfast Burritos and friendly staff.  I wish the North Location was still open, but I'll take their brews anywhere I can get them.  Skip Starbucks and hit up a real coffee shop...~~#~1
I'm a bit of a snob, I admit it. I generally prefer the full-service pamper me kind of salons that charge an arm and a leg. But times are tight - and I want my nails and my money. Enter Biagio. When you first walk into Biagio you would think you had walked into a fancy day spa. But when you read the prices, you wonder how they can stay in business. A "spa" pedicure, one of the most expensive treatments, is a whopping $49 (I say whopping with a sense of sarcasm). Not only do you get a great pedicure (best I've EVER received), but you get a leg and neck massage (yes the chairs are massage chairs, but real hands give you a real massage). A "spa" manicure, which also comes with a neck massage, is $25. The technicians are very nice, the store is immaculate, the tools are all sterilized, and the treatments are very high quality (even for a snob like me). Plus the atmosphere makes you feel like you are at a spa, not a strip-mall dive nail salon. I highly recommend Biagio. I have been there several times, and plan to go back often.~~#~1
I actually love this place and I always get great service when I'm there. The tootsie roll is by far my favorite. I must say, however, that I recommend the Sakana on Power over the one on Elliot... for some reason, I like the sushi over there better...?~~#~1
Best cupcakes ever. I can't get enough of the Strawberry and Red Velvet. They even have a gluten free Red Velvet! Order several to take home. They will give you a zip-loc bag that keeps them fresh and moist for days! I'm addicted. Not cheap, about $22 for 6 but when you taste them, who cares....~~#~1
Simply the best sandwiches I have ever tasted.The Mozarella, Tomato, Basil is perfect. The focaccia bread is perfectly crunchy and slightly salted to the consummate texture.I wish I still worked closer...~~#~1
Really as bad as it gets.Crap food.Over priced.Ugly, tasteless interiorBad music and music systemTired staffThis place needs to either have a complete redo or it needs to close. I would rather go down the street and eat at Applebee's, and I have never been to an Applebee's. Too many other choices now in the neighborhood for this place to go on in its present condition. Then again, there might be enough people around these parts with really bad taste to keep the place going.~~#~1
These are some great cheesesteaks. I have come here multiplier times and have never left unhappy. The staff are nice and the food is delicious.  Also try the 'Cheesesteak Fries' they are freakin amazing! I am glad I work next to this place, always a great lunch.~~#~1
I work next door, and I love her ! She has done an excellent job of slim fitting my baggy shirts !! Well she did ask me if I was gay but then hey, given how animated I get about clothes I dont blame her for askin ! My SO found this rather amusing and laughed her head off... oh well getting back to my review. I love nadya cuz she does a wonderful job, each time. She knows when the darts will give the slimming effect and when the sides are to be taken in. Its never too tight and never too lose, and she always always delivers on time.  I have been here atleast 10 times !! Trust me my metrosexuality wouldnt let me let me go back if it wasnt a five star service!!~~#~1
Excellent food! I do say the service isn't always the best, but the outcome of the food exceeds my expectations. Definitely recommend ordering the Artichoke Salad! Not what you'd expect out of a typical boring salad! Not just stuffed with a large amount of dull, boring lettuce, but filled with spices and tons of flavor.~~#~1
Jodi is fantastic!  Extraordinary!  After too many expensive yet less-than-average salon expereinces, my hair has been less beautiful than its potential.  Jodi gave me a very thorough consultation after I did some research to find the best colorist for me.  During my appointment, Jodi was professional, efficient and friendly.  I left the salon with soft, gorgeous hair... lovely color, care of the INOA line, and I felt beautiful again.  She did what at least half a dozen other highly recommended colorists did not accomplish.  I'm ecstatic and relieved and I have finally found my colorist.  What more can a girl ask?  Thanks so much, Jodi.~~#~1
This location is quieter than the one at Arizona Mills Mall. No screaming kids in your way. The clothes are less disheveled, still attached to the hanger, but for the same low price. I get my husband's work shirts here for like $8. Ross understands that there are still skinny Americans out there and they carry size 4 pants. YESSSSS!I -3 the unusual house goods you can find at Ross. I redid my whole bathroom and made it into a nice Victorian style in light pink and a wood brown. They had this soft-green painted shelf that looked like a twisted vine. Where else can you find something like that? I found these two toothbrush cups that were painted with butterflies. Worth the $5 each. My bathroom is gorgeous. You'll want to take a crap in there.~~#~1
Super cool place I've been to 3-4 times now and only drawback is the noise if you are with someone you want to have a conversation with. Service could be better, but location and above average food at decent prices cancel that out.~~#~0
YogurtBuilderz provides a good sized dining area with many choices of yogurt and toppings. I did find it a little difficult to locate when I attempted to find the building - it is tucked away in the back corner of a strip mall parking lot. It was dark, late at night and took a few passes around the parking lot to zero in on the location. The staff was very friendly and the place was busy even for a Sunday night. For the staff and selection I give it a 3 star rating. It was good, but I didn't find it any different than the growing list of competition. I know this place is popular and self-serve frozen yogurt establishments are all the rage now. The economic model is great - you pay by the ounce and have your choice of any variety of yogurt and any topping available. Customers have the opportunity to build it as they wish, which allows those with specific tastes to have their wants fulfilled more so than a traditional store offering the generic selection of choices. All of that in mind, I don't like it (the industry). Too many choices creates an opportunity for indecision and slows down the lines as people stand around wondering what to put in it next. For those new to the game, you can create something that turns out to be rather nasty - for example, the white chocolate sauce is really very sweet and I find if mixed with other toppings makes it almost unbearable. The other reason I do not like these places is that I do not like to pay for food that I then have to make and serve myself. I go to restaurants and pay for a meal rather than cook it at home because a) I don't like doing it and b) I am horrific at it. While frozen yogurt does not require much preparation, there is still some assembly required. If I am paying, I prefer to have it built for me. But I realize I am in the minority. As popular as these chains are becoming I wouldn't be surprised to see "FroYo" overtake "unfriend" as word of the year in 2010.~~#~0
The Menu here is great.  So much to choose from and its always good.  No mater which location we visit our service is always good and we never have to wait long to be seated.  The Jambalaya is a big favorite, and the pizza here is awesome.  I've also noticed that they have improved the drink menu quite a bit~~#~1
great beer selectiongreat live musicgreat atmosphereI used to live across the street and nightcap it here everynight.there is always something to be had at rosie's.~~#~1
I LOVE this place. I have been craving their Baked Spaghetti Pie again for 5 years and I finally got it today since I'm back for a business trip! I remember pretty much everything on their menu is fresh and delicious. Their prices are great too! Very polite staff.~~#~1
Best chocolate croissants EVER!!!!~~#~1
This is my favorite place locally here in Phoenix, absolutely great coffee! Next to central highschool and light rail so there can be traffic when school let's out or rush hour.~~#~1
Best Thai food for your dollar in the entire valley. I'm no Thai expert, but I have been to at least a dozen here in the valley. Keep in mind - this is NOT a fancy place - just a simple, inexpensive, casual dining experience. WOW!~~#~1
Love Love Love it. The Frozen Yogurt is only 8 calories per ounce. You can get your yogurt fix and still be healthy. Also they run specials if you sign up for the deals. Then they have a punch card program as well. My husband loves going there because he can still get regular Thrifty Ice Cream.~~#~1
I love Tempe Marketplace and frequent it regularly.  It has many dining, shopping, and entertainment options.  It is an outdoor mall and in the summer there are misters and in the winter heat lamps and a large fire pit.  It has stores that are usually only found in malls such as Tilly's, American Eagle, and Victoria's Secret, but also freestanding stores such as Target, Best Buy, and Ulta.  There are a large variety of restaurants and a Harkin's Movie Theater as well.  It is a great place to hang out with friends and see the local night life!~~#~1
Ok, I hesitated writing a review of this place because I like that it's not busy, but I want the place to survive because I enjoy it so much. I hate gyms...I mean LOATHE them. From rude staff to unpleasant odors or creepy guys giving you longing looks while you're just trying to figure out which one of your friends with an advanced degree in engineering you can text to help you figure out how to get on a machine without having it rip your arm out of its socket because the staff is not going help you without paying for a personal trainer or because you don't look like you were already born on a nautilus machine. This gym is everything but. I went in because of the great introductory special and a recommendation of a friend. We're both training to swim the SF Bay for the 2011 Sharkfest Alcatraz Swim, so we needed a pool. As soon you walk in, the guy at the front desk treats you like you're an old buddy and cracks jokes like he is your best bar buddy. Awesome attitude. The place has never been overly crowded (even at peak hours right after work. I've never gone during the early morning or lunch hours).No waits on the machines and they have plenty of them. No waiting in the pool and even when there is a water aerobics class, one lane is left open to due laps. Hot tub, sauna, and some inexplicable walk in dunking tub (see, I'm not a gym aficionado or else I would know what that thing is for).Towel service, locks, and even gym shorts available. (no more using that excuse that you can't work out today because you left your work out clothes at home...they have some to check out there.)Even the seemingly cranky old lady doing her water workout was nice and called me sweetie and asked if I was ok when I inadvertently let out a puppy like whimper as my shoulder blades decided they wanted to cede from the union of my body. Note to self....don't do a month of the P90X with a friend, think you're hot stuff and on your way to a gym bod and then jump in a pool to do a mile swim without stretching because you think you're all that now. Had it not been for Grandma Water Aerobics, I might still be at the far end of the pool trying to inch my way back to the stairs hoping that the water on my face hid the tears that were going start gushing any minute if I couldn't make it to the hot tub to get my back to stop seizing up.  (Thank you, unknown Water Aerobics lady. You turned a moment of shame into motivation. Oh yeah, I will out swim grandma next time!)The place is in the basement of an office building next to the seemingly abandoned Chateaux on Central development. Central and....Encanto (?) You can park on the street (careful of the meters) or use the garage. The gym validates. There is a downstairs weight room (I haven't check it out yet as I because there is a free gym at my job.) Yes, I like this place so much, I am paying for a gym membership even though I have access to work out facilities for free in my own building....including free personal trainer....but instead I get in my car come 5pm and drive to a gym I pay for because this athletic club is worth it. I saw no young kids running around. The clientele seems to be early  30s and up, young urban professionals and some retirees who are just trying to stay healthy. No creepy people ogling you (which you may be looking for) and no rude gym bunnies laughing at you in your leotard on the treadmill....but really....you shouldn't have the leotard and hot pink leg warmers on anyway...it is 2010.  But hey, to each his own.~~#~1
I started working with Second Chance FitCenter in the spring of this year.  I went because I wanted to feel stronger, especially in my core.  I run and am a generally active dude, but wanted something more out of my physical body.  I had never done any type of "personal training" so I was a little apprehensive....and...I have REALLY enjoyed working with Heat - she is a great teacher, which if personal training is anything it is a psychologist/mentor/butt kicker/saint...so in my book that is a great teacher!!  Case in point:A few weeks ago I mentioned that I was not sure if I was improving - mostly just my own mind being negative.  So Heat said, "Next time we will try the very first workout we did.  Cool?"  I was game.  Dude!  I blew through that sucker - to the point were I was like "this is cake"...of course on the second and third time through the sets  (and I think fourth on this day...) it got harder and harder...and I totally kept up.  It was awesome.  I loved it. My Checklist:  Sense of accomplishment (check)Strength building (check)Piece of mind, knowing I am taking care of myself (check)Good teaching and patience (check)In short, I love my time at Second Chance.~~#~1
I need to stop going here so much, but it's hard to stay away.~~#~1
Great fresh sandwiches!! The pastrami and caprese are absolute perfection!! The orzo pasta salad is spot on for the summer.  Definitely a must id in mesa..they need more central location for sure!~~#~1
Excuse me. How in the world have I lived walking distance from Cornish Pasty Company for over a month and have only barely heard of this gem?! Thats what I want to know.A friend introduced us to Cornish Pasty saying it is "the best restaurant ever". I best give it a try then right? The Tempe location is smaller than the Mesa location but I LOVE its vibe. A small narrow walking space between people sitting at a counter behind the kitchen and people sitting at teeny tiny tables, dim lit lighting and candles and for the most part, pretty good music. My man and I ordered the Mexican Pasty and the Rosemary Chicken Pasty. They were unbelievable! SO GOOD. The Mexican Pasty was definitely the better of the two but I'd order both of them again any day. A little heavy dinner action to make a girl feel full and happy. I respect restaurants that have a plethora of vegetarian options. What generation are you living in if you don't offer veggie options these days? Get with the program all you other restaurants. You know who you are! I loved the entire experience and can't wait for our next trip.~~#~1
Love Bagel Nosh! The staff is so friendly and of course the food is delicious! I have to admit that the pumpkin latte was no Starbucks pumpkin latte, but the pumpkin cream cheese was amazing! ( I do realize it's no longer pumpkin season, I was just wishing I had some anyway) It can get busy on the weekend mornings, esp since the bike shop opened up next door, but I find it well worth the wait! (Oh, and fyi it closes at 2:30 - so get your coffee early!)~~#~1
We live in Chandler, so we get take out here probably once a month. My husband is from the east coast and in both his and my opinion, these are the best cheesesteaks around! We love their spicy peppers (they are hot!) and while I am not really a cheesesteak fan, their chicken cheesesteak sandwiches are fabulous! The owners are hard working and really appreciate all of their customers and let you know it! We have been eating here for three years now and have never had a bad experience.~~#~1
Impressive!   I dined at House of Tricks last week based on the Yelp reviews and was not disappointed.    The aromas from other's food while sitting around at bar let me know I was in for a good meal.   I had trouble deciding what to eat, so I ordered 3 appetizers:   Seafood Stuffed Poblano Pepper, Veal 2 ways, and Braized Oxtail.    The bartender did a fantastic job of recommending the order in which i received my food - lightest to heaviest.The "Veal 2 Ways" and "Braised Oxtail" were phenomenal.... a great combination of flavors and texture.   I think I'd put them both in my list of Top 10 dishes.   I can't wait to travel back to Phoenix to eat there again.    I'll also add the I really like the atmosphere.   Very chill place, but elegant without being stuffy.~~#~1
Wow, that is some great BBQ.  Probably the best I have had in Arizona.  The pork was great as were the BBQ beans.  I will be there again and again!~~#~1
20% off with a Yelp check in? SCORE! They have very unique, colorful and patterned vintage clothing for sale. But what I liked most about this store is their vintage jewelry! There's a local jeweler who makes rings out of old school buttons and brooches. I snatched up two really cute vintage rings.~~#~1
They have a new and improved menu and added more Korean dishes. Very good!!! I've been there 4 times since they added the new menu, and it's been good every time. Very authentic Korean food. This is my favorite spot now!! The dishes I had so far:Champong, Bulgogi, Sul-lung-tang, Neng-myun, Galbi, Yukgejang. All were very good. I can't wait to go back and try other food! Neng-myun (cold noodle) was especially good on muggy hot summer days.~~#~1
I love their turkey and provolone cold sub! Delicious with pickles added.~~#~1
Really good, healthy food.  Owner is super friendly. Would definitely recommend. :)~~#~1
I'm giving them a 5 star review for how they handled a poor experience we had.  My family came here for my brother's birthday a few weeks back, and two of our four dishes came out undercooked.  We brought it to the attention of our waitress, who brought the manager Adrienne over.  They both apologized profusely and took the charges off of our bill, which is what I would expect.  We were polite and appreciative of their apology and really didn't expect or ask for anything else.  However, they also offered to give us a credit to come back another time so they could prove to us that it was just a one time mistake.We took them up on the offer, and sure enough the food was excellent the second time around.  Our server was fantastic, Adrienne came by to make sure we were happy, and the chef even came out to make sure we were pleased with the meal.  They really went above and beyond to make sure we left with a positive opinion of their restaurant.  Everybody makes a mistake once and awhile, but not everyone has such excellent customer service to correct it!  I will gladly return here as a result.~~#~1
I cannot believe all these negative reviews. First I'd like to start with the prices. Don't get me wrong, I love a good deal, BUT, if you are going to complain about how jobs in America are moving to China and India and not shop at AA because of their prices, then you are a hypocrite. AA supports US jobs and their factory is here in the states where they actually care about ethics and their employees. And, they have sales too, I have been in this store more than a few times and seen 30% - 50% off sale signs. And, on their website you can shop the sale section and save up to 75% if not more.To the clothes - I understand some people may be weirded out and flash back into the 80's when they see the clothes here, as I have read from the reviews on here, BUT, these clothes are actually very stylish and a simple top with a simple pencil skirt  from AA and with some accessories you have a fab outfit. If you are looking for something not so simple try a white strapless romper with their petticoat skirt, add some accessories, and your done. The sizes - I am size 4-6 with curves, and the clothes from here fit me fine. I can understand the frustration if you are a little bigger and have had a hard time fitting into the clothes from AA. But, the good thing is that AA is now coming with XL sizes in some of their clothing. The models - I love the fact that the models are real and barefaced. As someone who has struggled with a skin condition, I always hate walking around the mall only to see photoshopped perfect faces surrounding me. I always feel comfortable when I walk into AA.This store - I have never had a bad experience. Always a good one. i like the store, the employees have always been nice to me, I have no complains.~~#~1
Food was good, I had the Frutti de Mare with red sauce and boy it is spicy, so be warned. Everyone else ordered the Spaghetti Pie, which was the special that night. It was OK, my mom's is better. The service was good, but the wait for a table was over an hour. Of course if was a Saturday night and they are having Glendale Glitters so it was really busy. The pizza is good, I have had it before, I am not the biggest wood fire pizza fan, because it is always burned on the bottom!~~#~0
Mylissa has given my daughter and me the *best* cuts! If you can, see her. She will take great care of you!~~#~1
So I was introduced to this station about 6 months ago by a fellow yelper who goes by Amy D... She has a wicked 8-10 spot on Tuesdays and I thoroughly enjoy listening to it on a weekly basis. Well, I was happened upon an opportunity... Nay! A priviledge of being a guest on this FABULOUS show and, being the attention whore that I have been labeled, I accepted.  I won't go into HOW I found myself being handed this prestigious title of KWSS Guest, but it involved a House of Clubs, Twitter, and a whole lot of begging (on my part)...There I was... in the presence of 100% pure, raw (Can't decide which word to use "Talent" or "Creativity") and in a pretty bad ass studio. The Fabulous Amy and I discussed all the important topics of the nation/world and stumbled on numerous great ideas. One being a cure for cancer! Okay, we didn't discover a cure per say... but we did briefly talk about it.The listeners were top notch and the atmosphere was professional, yet extremely comfortable. Plus, we actually got some free talent from a caller! He was awesome and sang me happy birthday.  It was sexy.Thanks for a great time, Amy and KWSS! You rock, alternatively!~~#~1
Good choice of ingredients, a bit out of a student budget, but it was WORTHY all the way. I was drooling with the flavors! Good environment and good service and good music (bistro style). I'm not much of a pizza eater, but this has a good place in my list! Forget about your papa dough or cheap Sunday pizzas...this is a real one!~~#~1
We stopped in to Copper Blues on Friday night after a Mercury game at the US Airways Center.  Fantastic place!  Unbelievable beer selection, great views of downtown and an excellent band the night that we were there made for a really great downtown experience.  Will definitely be back again soon!~~#~1
The kids love panda express.  My 9 year old actually complains that they give you too much food. This is pretty much the only non chicken nugget or spaghetti or pizza food that my 5 year old will eat.  And to be honest- I don't mind it either.~~#~1
Oooohhhh baby I loooove your way...everyday...yeeeaaaahhh.I wanna be with you night and day....Went back to the swizzle last night and fell in love again.With pool.With dives.With football.With beer.With diversity.With the random atrium.With the jukebox.With life.How can you beat pool and beer, combined with an awesome location, a diverse crowd, and a room full of people screaming at the TV because football is on? Then top that with the weird quirkiness that makes me warm and fuzzy on the inside...the atrium, a lovely bathroom and random bumper stickers at the bar. The End.~~#~1
Fantastic find for delicious, healthy food and good service!! A local friend said that they'd heard good things but hadn't been yet. They asked us to check it out., so we went for a late lunch mid-week and it was still jam packed (30 minute wait) at 1:30 p.m.. We sat at the bar and received terrific service. The fish tacos, steak tacos, bison burger and desserts were all delicious.It is an open-air style restaurant where you can see into the kitchen. All ingredients are super fresh and the culinary quality is extremely high given that they can make even the healthiest things taste wonderful. I strongly recommend this to anyone looking for a healthy food alternative.~~#~1
Newly opened Mexican restaurant tucked away in the Dobson and Germann area.  I would give the place 5 stars for decor, the owner has taken such great effort to make the restaurant look like old Mexico on the inside.The food was good but not great.  I did relish on the tomatillo salsa brought with the red salsa and chips.  The portions were pretty big, no room for dessert and had to request togo boxes.Ordered:Seafood Tacos (great with excellent presentation)Tia's Plato de Carne Asada: Tres Carnes - beef, pork and chicken (huge)Tia Rosa Burro (huge)I will definitely return and review, but overall I did like this place.~~#~0
Cherry on Top is a rare example of design by market analysis committee, who couldn't decide on a unique concept so they decided to "borrow" from all of their competitors' styles, turning out at least as well as if not better than its individual inspirations.The result provides convenient answers to the following frozen yogurt questions:- Can't decide between tart and traditional? Why not both?- Can't decide between standard or high-end sweet? Mix vanilla, taro, green tea, cheesecake (but only at your own risk.)- Feeling constrained by four fit all sizes? $0.39/oz., cup weight subtracted.- Wavering on the topping healthiness spectrum? Fruit to sugar cereal to nuts to crushed big brand candy available.The quality is close enough to most of the relevant rivals (as long as one is not requiring the desert honey Sweet Republic tart variant) but, correctly and perhaps intentionally, the value proposition is that most patrons won't care about the slight dip, trading off for the flexibility of purchasing (only) as much yogurt and toppings as desired while satisfying Hershey's-acclimated children with a Frankenstein of saccharine flavors and junk toppings as well guests from the city pining for the nearest Pinkberry with original tart plus kiwi, strawberries, blackberries and pineapple.~~#~0
This review is based on an event I attended here. I did not stay at the hotel as a guest or experience the bar. I was a guest at the Etiquette Dinner put on by ASU and affiliates. From the moment I entered the hotel, I felt welcomed. Each employee I passed greeted me with a smile and professionality. I thought the hotel interior was really cool also. When I was leaving the event, I thought how strange that locals never frequent hotels in their cities. I should try it!~~#~1
Bad ass, just like the name.  I've heard that this facility doesn't have any water restrictions so their course is lush & in tip top shape.  It's definitely a challenging course.  The staff is nice and the current off season rate is  $35 for residents!  You have to check it out, it's a great deal.~~#~1
Fantastic experience from valet to dessert!! Boyfriend and I were both very impressed. We were graciously greeted the moment we walked in by a man in a suit who walked us to the restaurant. Our server was knowledgeable about all the items on the menu and suggested some things to try when we were waffling between a few different choices. Cheese trio platter was sooooo good. I'll be getting that every time we come here and it was the perfect size for the two of us to share. I had the beet salad which was very good. Love the candied walnuts in it. Boyfriend had the lamb which he said was perfect: Tender, juicy and delicious!  The breads that came at the beginning of the meal were obviously homemade and fresh. Even the coffee was good. It's very rare for us to find a place that does it right so completely but I think we've found it.  Service was fantastic! Our glasses were never empty and we were well attended without being pestered. Could it be possible I can't find anything to criticize?! I can't. Love this place.~~#~1
Wow! I was in town on a week long business trip and the one thing I look forward to most when I travel are the meals. Cafe Monarch was a highlight of my trip. As soon as I walked through the door I felt cozy and right at home. Chef Chris asked me what I preferred out of a few selections and I went with the lamb chops and spinach.  Usually I'm pretty picky about lamb and always inquire about prep but I left myself in his hands.  Chef Chris served me a perfectly cooked thyme rubbed lamb with a wonderful citrus sauce.  Spinach was prepared with garlic and a hint of mint which complemented the lamb perfectly.  Simple, fresh, delicious...Just remember to bring cash~~#~1
If I was on death row and had to choose a meal for my "last supper" I would include the New Mexico Skillet (hold the chorizo) from Butters. I have searched high and low for any other breakfast place that compares to Butters and I cannot find anything. I thought that I had found a close contender in Perk Eatery in North Scottsdale but a second visit proved that they were not consistent.Butters is consistently amazing. The service is strangely fast but you'd have to be crazy to complain about that. Their menu is creative and there is a really great variety of food. I always want to try the crepes or french toast but I just can't bring myself to get anything other than the New Mexico skillet. Maybe one day I'll branch out.~~#~1
this location is kinda dumpy and seems dirty. it really isn't dirty per-se, just outdated, run down, and therefore gives a dirty vibe. the pizza is always good, but generally the lunch pizza could be warmer. wings are good too. salad bar is low quality. the 3 stars i awarded are really for the pizza, because if you only order that you'll probably be satisfied. and $4 even for 2 slices and a drink (including tax!) should i really have a right to complain about the outdated facility? probably not.~~#~0
Beer heaven!  What don't they have?  The staff has a taste for heavy body beer so if that isn't your ONLY criteria for great beer.  I would just go with your gut.  Their staff does know their stuff.~~#~1
The view, services, and drinks were perfect, but the food was nah... not good.Went there twice, first time was for drinks and view, it was wonderful, so we went again for dinner, the dish was not good.If you want a wonderful meal for your date, try somewhere else and go there for the drinks and view.After having a dinner there, I won't bring my guests there except for the view and drinks.~~#~0
Great ambiance (though a tad noisy), food, service and views. For our meals, we got the following:[Amuse bouche]I forgot what it was exactly, but it consisted of tumeric wild rice and a piece of shrimp. Tasty and a nice introduction, although the rice was annoying to eat with our forks.[Appetizer]Bread with 3 dips - The pepper pesto was hands down the winner, and the other two aren't worth mentioning.Butter lettuce salad - Decent, but a little too sweet for me.Lobster bisque - Very rich and creamy with a kick of smoky flavor.[Entree]Halibut - Best dish in recent memory! Get this. Just do it.Roasted cauliflower risotto - Came with very tender pieces of beef. The risotto was cooked well, but it was unfortunately too salty for me to properly enjoy.[Dessert]Espresso cup - The ice cream was delicious. The rest of it was okay.After dinner, we took a trip outside to take in the view. We also explored the surroundings around the entrance, but it only led to an empty lot with the unflattering presence of a dumpster. Oh well!The service was great, from the host calling to confirm the rsvp an hour after it was booked on opentable, to the sommelier suggesting a great bottle of wine, to the server making sure there was a candle in the dessert. Two thumbs up!Totally coming back once it cools down to be able to dine/drink outside. Woohoo!~~#~1
Lots of cool, cute and educational things here for my two kiddies. I stop in here for each birthday/Christmas to balance out the "junk" toys. I love the art project portfolio that is divided by school year and the school memory books. :)~~#~1
Dined here for the first time tonight. The food was..A-OK! Certainly not authentic Mediterranean food but I don't think it is trying to be. The first thing we noticed when we walked in was the loudness.  Way. Too. Damn. Loud. From an acoustician's standpoint, all the hard surfaces and the cavernous dining room make for a very loud joint. This is a big minus in my book.On to the food!  We ordered the beef gyro sandwich.  Very average but tasty nonetheless. Checked out the lentils and rice salad served warm over a bed of lettuce and veggies with dressing. Sadly, this was a bit of a miss for me. The rice was quite mushy and just didn't stand up to the heft of the lentils. The taste itself was quite fine but I couldn't get past the texture. Also, if you order this dish, know that the grain/legume level far outweighs the veggies. A huge portion (which is great for the pocketbook) but beware if you're watching carbs. The salad below was actually refreshing but all in all, the dish just wasn't for me. Also had the dolmades which were quite nice served cold (albeit a little overstuffed for my liking).  Our server was very good, very accommodating with special requests.  Service was a bright spot for sure.Without a doubt, while I didn't LOVE the food here, it was tasty enough for me to come back again and give it another try!~~#~0
Great service, I didn't get steak from here (yes, I know...a steakhouse), just got the Zesty Thai Salmon. The salmon was awesome with the chili mayo, baked potato, and asparagus. Can't wait to go back to try their other dishes.Thank you Kathy (owner) for taking the time to send me the name of the dish! Had to update this review and rating because of it :D~~#~1
Very Clean store. But I guess when you're paying about 300% more than you would anywhere else, the place can afford it. The people in the front are pretty friendly. There is a lady in the deli, she is pretty friendly/talkative. There are people who mill around the store wearing name tags, they are not friendly or polite.I just cannot get over how expensive safeway is.~~#~0
I LOVE THIS PLACE I JUST CAN'T NOT GET ENOUGH OF NCOUNTER!the vibe is young clean and fresh. the good is so delish.. I keep telling all my friends to go here for brunch (:~~#~1
One of my favorites. The crispy chicken tacos are overstuffed with meat,lettuce,cheese and always filling. The prices are reasonable for what you get. Also like Julios g  too next door for quick take out  or "no Tip" casual meal. Self serve chips and mild chunky salsa  are terrific.~~#~1
Hubbard Family Swim School has become a staple for our family. You can feel the warmth and dedication on every visit. Our kids love it and are excited to come to every lesson. We even have birthday parties here!The instruction is top-notch and it's evident while watching through the huge glass wall.Most of all, my 5 year old is a much better swimmer than I am, his father. Thanks to Hubbard.~~#~1
I wish they had a "0" star option too!The service and food was awful. Just a bunch of kids running the place.  The place closes at 10pm but when we went in there at 8pm all the workers were too busy cleaning to go home early to help us.  The food was burnt  on one side and raw on the other. The manager was too busy flirting with the other help. We couldn't get drinks because all the glasses where dirty, we were told by our waitress. We asked for the manager before we left at 8:45 and was told he already went home for the evening. What kind of manager leaves a bunch of teenager to run the place? NEVER GOING BACK!!!!~~#~1
This is not an Asian Topless Bar. It is an Asian "Tapas" bar. The guys I was traveling with spent the first ten minutes waiting for the show to start and were disappointed when I smacked them all for actually thinking I would take my coworkers to a topless bar. "Tapas" are little appetizer plates, and Sens is all about getting a little taste of everything. The atmosphere is fantastic - eclectic, moody and very, very cozy (so I recommend reservations). The little dishes are about four single servings, so you'll want to order several plates! Highly recommend the volcano flamed beef and the sugar cane pork. The food is very flavorful -- but everything is a bit spicy (garlicky-spicy), even the dishes they call "mild." Plates run about $6-$9 each, and each person in our party ordered 3 or 4 plates...we were all full by the time we left! Definitely get a cocktail, their mixed drink menu is fab (White Sin is absolutely sinful...and absolutely worth the indulgence).~~#~1
Good service but the food was horrific. The pollo fundido was dry & no flavor.  Could not eat the tamale it was so bad. Will not go back. I had better Mexican off the neighborhood roach coach.~~#~1
By far the best poker room in the state and I have played in every casino poker room in the valley. The action is always there-lots of dead money to be picked up if you know where to look. Good promotions, amazing food served table side and all the sports games you can watch. I wish they would bring back 6-12 limit but 8-16 will have to do =) such an improvement over the tents, though they will always hold a place in my heart. It sucks cause I work right next to the casino and every night after work I have a tough decision..go home to my family or go to my favorite card room and tear it up. If you havent been there-MUST GO.~~#~1
Staying at the Royal Palms has been on my bucket list for a while now, because I've stayed at just about every other resort in town that I've really wanted to check out.  Oddly enough, this also happens to be the closest one to where I actually live, so it seems strange to drop a load of cash to stay in a hotel four miles away from home.  No matter, last month was my golden birthday and this is where my lovely girlfriend decided we were going to stay.  Score.  We had my party (a surprise, nicely pulled off) and we invited a bunch of people back to our room afterwards to continue the festivities.  It was a pretty standard room, a bed, fireplace, a couple of chairs, big bathroom, a table and chairs on the patio (I believe they call it a valencia suite).  Life was grand.Until the morning.  *bang bang*  WTF is that noise?  *bang bang*  There was pounding and various noises coming from the room next to us, and it wasn't happening on the bed.  Are they really doing construction at 8:15am?  It continued.  My girlfriend called down to the front desk.  The noise stopped.  Then it continued.  *bang bang*  We were about to lose it. They called our room, "do you mind if they continue working?".  Actually, we had just fallen back asleep...So this is not how the Royal Palms treats their guests.  No, any resort with a Director of Romance is serious about making their guests stay enjoyable, so I knew this was not normal.  A conversation took place, and profanity and yelling wasn't even necessary.  Essentially, they were going to comp our room, but they offered that we stay another night in the presidential villa for the same price...how could we say no?I hung out at the resort all day because I was feeling miserable.  They comped lunch, and about 4pm, they moved us to our new room.  Nice place, the presidential villa.  It's actually only one bedroom, but has a huge living room, dining room, kitchen, two fireplaces, three patios with fireplaces and water feature, old-school tub, double-shower with outdoor shower, a bidet,  you know...typical amenities.  I was still feeling terrible (yay, the flu!) , so we opted to order room service from T. Cooks.  Naturally, if they hadn't done enough, they comped dinner as well.We had an extremely atypical experience at the Royal Palms our first night, I have no question about that.  But they more than made up for it.  They were gracious, they smiled, they apologized, and they made it right immediately.  I can't ask for anything more from that from a place that prides itself in its customer service.  I would not hesitate to stay here again.~~#~1
happy hour is from 3p-6p and then again from 9p-11p, which is pure genius. make sure you get your parking ticket balidated, because the Eritrean girl in the parking garage will make you go back in the restaurant and get that joint stamped if you forget. BUZZKILL.~~#~1
I love this place.You might ask "why does the free roving large land mammal love a place that makes him sweat so hard that he's puked, twice?"And here's why: if you can get me to yack during a workout from pushing me hard and coming up with exercises I've not done before (which is hard with 4 years in the Army, 17 years of Rugby, and 30 years of riding a bike) then you're doing something RIGHT!My special lady friend got me into the idea of this as a good way to dog stomp one another via a proxy named Jeff. Jeff is our trainer, and if you'll pardon my digression, allow me to share with you about Jeff.We have this song in Rugby called "The S&M Man." Its a less than politically correct song about a special person, usually someone who trains us or who is a hell of a rugger him/herself, who is so sick, so wrong, that he makes pain fun and delightful. And I use the word "pain" in the best way. Pain, after all, is just weakness, and in my case old pizzas, leaving the body.Jeff is amazing. He gets it done in 30 minutes to the point where I don't really want to do anything the next day. Its in and out, slam, bam, thank you ma'am with Jeff and Vitality. This is going to be a part of my training for the long term.~~#~1
I was accused of training my wife for compensation and was told to leave the gym or he (Page the trainer) was going to call the cops.  I don't know how a trainer confuses me working WITH my wife with training my wife for compensation.    Management handled this issue horribly.   Their lack of attention to the matter showed exactly what a customer of 6 years was worth.   You are treated only as a number.  Do yourself a favor and stay away.  I have since started going to a gym which is much more expensive but worth every penny to be treated with respect.~~#~1
i too came because of a living social deal, as it turned out it really didn't save us any money. the buffet is odd. lots of different kinds of food. onion rings, fries, chicken nuggets with baked cheese eggplant, stuffed grape leaves, hummus. i sampled a bit of everything.i liked the soup, very nice, i couldn't identify the spice, i don't know anything about mediterranean food. but i know what i like. i like 3 different olive dominated dishes, i wish i could cook eggplant that kept it shape this well. i liked the hot pita bread. i loved salad with big chucks of feta cheese. there where several tasty chicken dishes that were excellently seasoned with big chucks of flavorful chicken.the american staples, probably for the kids and unadventuresome guests was bland and a bit dry, expected for a buffet, where the food sits out under lights.advice:group the foods by origin, not by meat, vegies, salad.make up a route down one side of the serving table, greek, turkish, Lebanese. make it a learning experience, tell us which dishes use olives, what kinds of spices.if you want people to come back teach them a little bit about the food, share the culture, don't mix chickem mcnuggets with a tasty pulled chicken dish just because they both have chicken in them. tell me why this is good food, help me learn something the cook knows about his homeland.so i walk down one side and get a greek-turkish meal. the other side is another culture, then one side for the bland american food. as is everything was mixed up.now, i'm going back again. with my laptop and a notepad, and hungry. i'm going to taste each dish by label- if i don't know what it is, i'm going to sit down and google it. i'm going to learn where it's from and what spices are in it. i'm going to make my own learning experience. if the owners sit down with me and explain how their food expresses their culture, i'll rate it 5 stars next time.it's a family business, it's a huge building, it has a good talented cook(s) somewhere in the kitchen, it is good tasting food. it needs to be displayed and presented differently. it wasn't busy, a shame, industrialized food is always bland and busy.now, if you grew up with these dishes, you can leave a review about their tastiness and authenticity. that would help.~~#~0
OMG! I am so frustrated at this store, I have never met such an incompetent group of people in my entire shopping life. First, I called Fry's Electronics to check to see if they had a specific GPS model that worked in Europe. I called because I live at 115th Ave and Buckeye which is about 20miles from the nearest store. The call center informed me they did not carry that model but listed about 10 other GPS with maps of Europe. I asked again those models have maps of Europe? "Yes and Australia too". And you have those models in stock? "Yes." What is the price range? "$100 to $300". Thank you. FIRST MISINFORMATION! So I drove to  30th Ave and Thunderbird, talked with "GPS Specialist" (which apparently means nothing) and he (Jared) informed me they did not have any GPS units with European maps!! He said the call center "is a bunch of retards" and that those were all last years models. Then he called someone and looked at several GPS Units. When he did not know  if the unit had European maps or not he GOOGLED them! (okay not confident in your product knowledge). Then he sold me a $260 unit with European maps. SECOND MISINFORMATION. I drove all the way home and the GPS did not have European maps! I had to buy them for another $100 which I could have done with a cheaper GPS.So I drive back to Fry's. Speak with a Supervisor, they return my first GPS. I speak with the same sales rep (ya thats great). He says he figured out 25min after I left that he sold me the wrong product and none of their GPS have european maps. So I then buy the cheapest model that was could download European maps, according the the sales rep Garmin NUVI 50Lm for $129.  THIRD MISINFORMATION. Because according to the Garmin site the NUVI 40Lm is also compatible and cheaper. I then went home bought the $100 European map and couldn't download it to my GPS because there wasn't enough space available!!!Now I have to buy a miniSD Card and a miniSD reader for my Mac book. Awesome. Great to know that the electronic store knows nothing about electronics!~~#~1
Went to Deer Garden Signature last night with my wife for dinner.  We had just returned from our Labor Day Week trip.  I ordered a fish soup with dumpling, fish balls, and Korean crystal noodles.  My wife ordered preserved pork in a clay pot.  The preserved pork in clay pot did not seem to interest me.  To me it looked like sausage with rice, and nothing particularly interesting.The soup was actually pretty good.  My wife and I liked it much better.  The only thing we think they could have done better is the following:My wife and I were not exactly familiar with the style of food.  My wife is Vietnamese.  Maybe as part of the banner for the restaurant they should put Guandong Style Cuisine under the name.  Otherwise the food is pretty good.  Rahul Iyer~~#~0
Great food!!! The French dip is to die for!! Great Service! Clean and fancy especially for the area it's located in!  Def a hidden gem! My husband and I both love going here and can't wait until next time.~~#~1
Amazing!  The Chicken sausage pasta definitely works!~~#~1
WOW!  I have never been to a place with service this horrible.  I may have caught them on a bad night, but I'm not giving them a second chance to find out!I came in with a group of 4.  We stood up front for 5-10 minutes before waving someone down to be seated.  That was a mistake..As we're waiting for a server to take our drink order, we noticed that EVERY single table had empty cups waiting to be refilled, dirty plates that needed bussing, and people with impatient faces.  There was only 1-2 dedicated servers, and they completely ignored us.We stuck around just to see how long it would take before someone took our drink order, it was like being in the Twilight Zone.  After 30 minutes and flagging down 3 employees, we just walked out laughing, no one had even apologized for the wait, I'm not sure they even saw us leave!  It was the strangest restaurant experience of my life.What a joke...**EDIT**  To their credit, right after I posted this review, I received a message explaining that the Director of Operations would like to amend the situation, even going so far as to include their cell number.  I admit that I feel strange posting such a negative statement amid all the 4 and 5 star reviews, I'm assuming I caught them on a really bad night.  I'll edit this if I ever return to the restaurant, but the fact that someone actually reached out to try to rectify things says something~~#~1
YUMMMMMM!!!! I was brought to this place by a friend and was so glad to find it! Very clean and unique casual setting. Staff were very friendly, food was hot, fresh and amazingly gooy...definately a 4+ napkin kind of meal. So happy to see they serve Chicken philly -steak as well as the usual philly cheese steak and sweet potatoe fries! Find out where this place is because it could be easily over looked and you would be missing out on some deeee-licous food. This place is a must try!~~#~1
After hearing good things about the Scottsdale location, I was looking forward to lunch at Arcadia Farms when visiting the museum for the Ansel Adams showing.  Unfortunately, it was a little disappointing.Service was painfully slow.  I'm not sure if that was the kitchen or the server, but in either case, I was not impressed.We started with the baked goat cheese.  For some reason, I envisioned the caramelized onions and roasted tomatoes atop the cheese, but everything was combined.  While it was quite good, only the bottom portion was hot.  The rest of it was only lukewarm.  I wondered if perhaps the dish is prepared ahead and refrigerated, resulting in the uneven temperature.We also shared the smoked turkey and warm brie sandwich with white bean salad.  They generously served each of us a full side of the salad with our half sandwich, which was more than enough.  Although the sandwich had just been grilled, the inside was still somewhat cold.  I also would have preferred just a little more apple, but overall, it was A-OK.The white bean salad with red peppers and possibly cucumber if I remember correctly was sorely lacking in flavor.  Salt helped, but not enough to save the dish.  If it was dressed with anything other than oil, I missed it.  Arcadia is just fine if you're already at the museum and looking for a bite.  Otherwise, I don't know that I would return.~~#~0
I've decided to completely write this place off, and here is why you should too:THREE TIMES I have tried to go here and they have been closed, all the while their website and posted hours say they should be open. If one of you wants to drive all the way here from the suburbs, you'd better call first because this place cannot be trusted. I've wasted my time and spent hungry minutes walking here only to be disappointed. Vitamin T will fail, there I said it.~~#~1
I am obsessed with this place!  I cannot say enough amazing things...I love their exhibits...I love Arcadia Farms inside...I love the architecture and design of the building...I love the staff (they are so helpful)...the gift shop is fabulous (I got the cutest watch bangle)...I love the giant red t-rex out front...I love the kids area (or at least my son does)...I love the diversity of the art!  I would recommend getting a membership because it allows you to be able go all year long with your loved ones and family!  You can have weddings here and they are beautiful!  They have events here all the time if you sign up for emails or become a member...at least just go once and you will fall in love!~~#~1
Fajitas is one of those places where you may go for an occasional, unmemorable lunch. Nothing is gross. Nothing is exceptional. Everything is just, well, there. I've tried different variations of the fajitas theme over several lunches (chicken, steak, veggie, etc.) and they were all ok. Not a big fan of their tortillas, though.If you work anywhere near there, then I'd say go ahead. It's a safe bet for lunch. You won't puke or curse the world. But is it a joint where I'm saying, "Dude, you GOTTA try this place out"? Nah. You've had better fajitas elsewhere...3 Stars.~~#~0
I'm not gonna lie, I possibly had the best sunny side up eggs ever. A simple dish so rarely cooked perfectly.~~#~1
Clean, bright and quick.I came here with my husband, and we both had a combo-platter that included one masala dhosa, an idli, and some sambar. It was all tasty -- and waaayyy too much food.I guess it's a mixed bag because some of his friends (they all work nearby) come here multiple times a week for lunch, and others swear its awful. As for me, I like the chutney bar - it's nice to be able to get as much as you want, and I recommend both the coconut chutney and the mint chutney -- or, blend them together, like my mother-in-law does with her homemade kind. Yummy.I think this place is quite tasty, but I won't come here often, just due to the fact that it's a major carb overload, and I wish the dhosas weren't quite so expensive (I think they're about $7.50 for one?).But, that being said, it's great for a once-in-awhile-treat.~~#~0
SawTh[sic] Sense Christmas show for the second time last weekend.  Great show - laughed my ass off.  Thinking about going back for closing weekend...  :)~~#~1

Thank goodness for Sue at Mill Avenue Travel. We contacted Sue to book our honeymoon trip to St. Lucia at one of the Sandals resort.  She was great with setting everything up, booking airfare etc.  When our original airfare decided to cancel the flight, she made sure we had a comparable one booked.  The best thing she did for us was encourage us to purchase travel insurance.  When we arrived at our Miami hotel at 10:30pm the night prior to leaving for St. Lucia, we had discovered Sue had left us an urgent note to contact her.  We found out a hurricane had hit St. Lucia and all of a sudden our honeymoon plans starting crumbling apart.  Because of Sue and our travel insurance (thank goodness we listened to the expert on this one!), we were able to change our honeymoon to a Sandals resort in the Bahamas and didn't miss a beat.  Sue was in constant contact with us, which calmed the craziness I was feeling (and I'm sure my new husband was relieved).  The airlines even took care of our baggage fees on the way to the Bahamas.  If we had booked this trip on our own, we would have been up a creek without a paddle.  I most definitely would not have purchased travel insurance and our honeymoon would not have turned out to be the amazing trip it was. We will definitely be using Sue again.~~#~1
I've been going here for the past 9+ years and it's pretty much the basic local circle-K. Not much to say past that. I do dig the walk-in beer cooler but also wonder who in the hell buys the bags of bananas?~~#~0
All I needed to complete my delicious meal here was a good Cuban cigar and some brandy!We had the Papa Rellena for an appetizer... very very good. Its a beef filled potato cake with a cilantro lime sauce.For entrees my wife and I shared two dishes... the Ropa Viejas (shredded beef brisket in a tomato wine sauce) and the Gallina Frita (crispy fried shredded chicken, onions, in a mojo garlic lime sauce....amazing!Both dishes were large...with tons of meat.Great service and really good mojitos make for a nice evening out at the Havana Cafe.For dessert we indulged on the "Best Of Phoenix" (Phoenix New Times) Caramel Flan.... OMG!!!! And the coffee was yummy too! We also found a 15% coupon in DineInAz.com.... saved us almost $7!As the sign over the door says... "Cha Cha Cha!"~~#~1
There were 3 cars in the parking lot and people walking to the door but the young lady closed the doors at 9:51pmThe young lady spoke through the glass for atleast 4 minutes explaining she would not open the doorsI live behind this location but I may not return. There is a Walgreens off of 7th Street...~~#~1
I am writing this review only for the optical department. I accidentally poked my eye with a branch yesterday and knew I had damaged it so I went to the Gilbert Costco optician and asked if I could be seeing on an emergency basis. The receptionist asked me if I could come back in 5 hours to which I stated it was an emergency and could asked the Dr if she could see me. She asked her and she said no she did not have time.I find it very unbelievable that on an emergency basis they can turn someone away who has a Costco optics patient for years. I recognize that she had a patient at the time but I said I could wait until after so she could at least take 5 minutes to tell me if I should go to a hospital or not. Dont ever waste your time going here if you need immediate attention for an emergency because they will not make room for you.~~#~1
Oh boy.. I usually LOVE LOVE Mucho Gusto.. but NO ME GUSTA today!We got a to go order, perhaps that was mistake numero uno.  I got the nachos.. really, you can't mess those up... Or so I thouhgt! I mean Filiberto's would have been a better choice!  Can you say cold soggy mess.. maybe that was my fault. I will accept the blame. I really should have known better. Mistake numero dos... What do you call Shrimp Cocktail with out the shrimp?? Bad Service! Lack of quality control....Really.. Really? You forgot the shimp? How do you do that.... Better question WHO DOES THAT?Mistake numero tres...lemme just say burned tasting chips (as opposed to my soggy nacho chips) and left an acrid taste in ones mouth and the most offending guacamole that I have ever had. Let me just say that my co worker and I eat here frequently enough that we can order for each other. We also know to order our guacamole with out the Grand Marnier galze thingy on top.  Mucho Gusto you mucho FAILED me today.  I hate leaving a bad review without first compaining to management so expect a phone call from me shortly.~~#~1
Big fan of this store - the owner tries very hard to create an inviting atmosphere for all levels of gamers. Further, the store provides for a host of niches, including euro-games, Ameritrash, role playing, and miniature wargaming. Good amount of supplies (both GW and P3, among others). Lots of tables for miniature gaming, board games, CCGs, and painting in the back (and a fridge with soda). They've started carrying MTG over the last few months, and that collection has grown. Always something going on here, but nothing intimidating. The owner is very, very helpful: willing to answer questions about painting, games, and to make special orders (even trips over to Gilbert at Battlefoam when necessary). Yep, big fan.~~#~1
Kids love Disney, and so do I.  One of my favorite things at this location (as opposed to the AZ Mills location) is the magic princess mirror.  Grab any of the princess items (shoes, tiara, wand, etc) off the rack, and wave the package with the UPC symbol facing the jewels and mirror, and after a few seconds, that particular princess will appear in the mirror with a little story for the kids.~~#~1
This is one of the top three Dog Parks in the Valley. Plenty of room, well lit in the evenings, plenty of water. I've seen the attendance shift slightly in the last year with less hipsters and more kooks coming in. Not a problem though because there are always multiple groups to mingle with.For photos and a complete review of this park go to www.dogparkriot.com.~~#~1
Ok, I'll say this up front, I don't like chains.  There are just far too many awesome restaurants in Phoenix/Scottsdale to go to a chain.That being said, this place is amazing and the quality and consistency here is unreal.  Yes, it "seems" expensive but once you've eaten here you'll realize that you are absolutely getting your moneys worth.So much awesome unlimited red meat.Don't let them trick you with the salad bar!  It's killer but don't fill up!  And don't be ashamed to leave your flipper thing on GREEN, the sign of meat greed. hahahahaha.Lastly, try the Tres Leches and the Key Lime Pie, out of this world.~~#~1
I love this place. It was so beautiful over the holidays with all the lights and garlands. I think the people who run this have a lot of pride in their business. The room was clean and the beds so comfortable. The decor is rustic but elegant at the same time. I liked how close we got to park to our room...super convenient. Lots of coupons given to us at checkin too. Great experience!~~#~1
The service was great! We had a large group & had called prior to make a reservation. Our table was ready when we arrived & they had assigned 2 servers. They were both incredibly pleasant & attentive. Our food came out really quickly & no one had any complaints. I wouldn't say this was authentic Mexican food, but it doesn't have to be. A good time was had by all :)~~#~0
Very nice and helpful staff. One guys always asks me too many questions but I figured he was just trying to be nice. They're on top of trying to sell you a new phone and service. But when you shoot them down they get off your ass about it.~~#~0
Discount Tire is our go to place for tires. Of course living way out here in Surprise, there aren't many other options. (if any) We recently got new wheels/ tires for our truck as well as the boat trailer. Quick, efficient, professional service is what we've come to expect at Discount. The only complaint is the lack of follow up. More often than not my husband has to call them to check the status of orders he has placed. They say they will call him when this or that comes in...yet he is always the one placing the calls. I'd like to see them actually follow up with their clients as promised when orders come in. That would make this already pretty great business even better!~~#~0
went back to the cork and experienced the fall menu. i am afraid that my second experience was not sa good as my first. the service was great,the resturant beautiful,but the food did not make me say yum yum with each bite like my first visit. 3 of us had the rabitt risoto and none of us really liked it. the scollops were great the fig salad was ok but the duck was so over done it was like power and way too salty. the creme brule came it was about 3/4 a cup portion $6.00 that was rediculuslly too small of a desert for $6.00 get real CORK i am afraid this will be my last visit. there are too many choices . Like Roy's Hawian Fusion Cusiene , Roy's is more cosistent and flavorable and mor reasanablly priced sorry CORK~~#~0
love love love it! What a quaint little piece of heaven. Located south phoenix...I wasn't sure what this place would look like as we kept driving south but as we walked onto the property it felt as if you were no longer in the big overcrowded city. We went to the morning glory cafe for breakfast. The food was wonderful and the presentation was great! I highly recommend it. It would make a wonderful place for a baby or wedding shower!!~~#~1
Wow! Food was great! But the service was even better!!! We got there early so we didn't have to wait a long time.  Their computer system was down, so instead of asking for cash or taking our card numbers, they comped out lunch. So impressed with this place! And such a cool vibe!~~#~1
Probably more worthy of 3.5 stars.  Damn the Yelp constraints!  Marketplace was pretty busy tonight now that you can actually go out in the evening without a gentle breeze feeling more like a blow torch in your face.  In spite of that, our wait to be seated was fairly quick.  But where was our server?  Outside listening to the band?  We need liquid refreshment!Finally our server arrived and apologized for the wait at the same time the manager arrived and also apologized and comped us an appetizer.  Wow!  We hadn't even complained.  We had the hummus which was very tasty but a little thin and a mango tandoori chicken pizza.  Nice combination of sweet mango, spicy curry sauce, and the grilled chicken.  Service was excellent once we got over the initial bump.While I usually don't plan to go to CPK, it's nice to know this one is there.~~#~0
Whenever I'm looking for a quick healthy lunch, and am tired of salads from the grocery store, I swing by Zoe's Kitchen on Camelback. For a long time I used to get the spinach and chicken quesadillas, however last time I went in, I realized they didn't have them on the menu anymore. The manager that was on duty was super friendly and helpful, and explained it was now basically the spinach roll-ups (add chicken). I must say, they are even more delicious!Is it your cheapest lunch option? Probably not. I'm a frugal person by nature, but it definitely beats eating Fast Food. So it's worth the extra buck or two to know you're not loading yourself up with tons of grease and carbs. I've introduced a lot of my coworkers to Zoe's and they all love it too. Now if only they can open up in Gilbert or Chandler near where I live!~~#~1
Ok, so I know that this private shooting club has had it's share of problems with membership and maintenance issues but I have to say, in the last 6 months, under the direction of a semi-new board of directors, the range facilities have been greatly improved. The members can enjoy shooting pistols or rifles pretty much all day every day uninterupted except when a scheduled match is on the club calendar located at www.phoenixrodandgun. This new fully updated calendar is really cutting down on the number of scheduling conflicts between match directors and members. Also, since aquiring new Range Staff, the number of complaints about other members or range employees has gone way down. I do have to say, the range which is located right in central phoenix is affordable, practical and overall a great shooting experience.~~#~1
Gracie's is a small thrift store with decent items.  The prices are a little less than you would pay at Goodwill.  You can get a pair of jeans for about $5.  If you need a belt, this would be a good place to go, only $2.  I didn't find anything to buy for myself, but we found a new pair of shorts for my son.  Only $2.50.   Just an FYI, it costs $0.75 to use your debit card.~~#~0
Really great food and service, and it worked out just fine for my two kids, ages 7 and 10. (Meatball pizza was a hit for the younger one; the older one shared sausage pizza and mussels.) The food came very quickly. We had all small plates and pizza, not entrees: kale chips, fried chickpeas, peppers, mozzarella salad. Dessert was great. The mousse was first rate, and the parsnip creme brulée was delicious (though we couldn't taste any parsnip; it just tasted like excellent, flavorful creme brulée). One of the best meals we had in Arizona. And we also really liked the decor. Simple, elegant, and also fun/creative. Not sure why anyone would ding them for that. Also, the portion sizes were just fine. We all left full but not feeling gross. We're from MA, and were unaware of the chef's celebrity. I wonder if some of the griping here is just celebrity bashing, or a reaction against some sort of hype? I'm outside that loop, but it just struck us as an excellent and fun place with great food and no pretension. Just thorough competence. Note: It's a nice walk from the Arizona Biltmore Hotel. Under 2 miles.~~#~1
Polite friendly staff. Great, always clean place.  The gym is great and never too crowded.~~#~1
I LOVE this place..  This is my sushi bar.  Danny, one of the two sushi chef's is awesome.  I have always found their sushi to be very fresh.About a year ago they came out with a special sushi menu.  With rolls like these: Dirty Harry, Mr. Miagi, Rio, you cannot go wrong.  Especially if you like spicy (like me)!Even the non-sushi is great.  This is one place my 6 year old loves that doesn't have a drive through window.Also, $4.50 sake bombs!!!  $4.50!Go here.  Try it.  Don't be scared off by a couple of so-so (ok, 1 bad) reviews.  I am looking to even have a UYE here in the near future!  Should be getting a call tomorrow to get it scheduled.Almost forgot!  They have some big screen TV's!  Watch sports here!  They are hugely popular for UFC fights and football..  Just go.  Now..  Seriously.  Review part is over..  You are wasting time reading the fodder I have written here.  You could be finding your keys..  Putting on socks and shoes..  Hell, skip the socks..  Wear sandals.  Save time.~~#~1
My friend has raved about this place for months, so for her birthday the girls and I got together for a little pizza field trip to LGO. It was amazing! Just as good as Mozza Pizzeria in LA., but around 400 miles closer. I also love the little grocery store. Very cute things to buy.~~#~1
Sunflower market is WAY cheaper than Whole Foods and has a lot more than Sprouts. It's my first choice of healthy grocery stores!They have the freshest produce around without it being full of bugs like Trader Joes. Their selection is very wide and their employees are really nice. Seriously I can't stand the employees at Whole Foods or Sprouts. They're such pretentious jerks sometimes. Whether I need lamb or bison meat, coconut milk ice cream, or almonds...this is always my first choice. They're also the only place in town that has every kind of vegan sliced cheese. Whole and Sprouts have some of them but which flavors are sporadic and random. I will never stray from Sunflower again!~~#~1
Just when I'm about to give up on my search for good Thai around Glendale, I stumble upon a true diamond in the rough. Don't be fooled by the shabby looks of the outside plaza; the inside is contrarily well orchestrated with subtle Thai ornaments and design. A huge desk in the lobby and bigger one inside the dining hall gives this establishment an odd but distinct hotel feel. Much like that feeling, the service is intriguingly exceptional from the time you walk into the front door. The food that I've tried here so far is... may I say it... divine. I started off with the squid salad with mint and lemongrass and it was packed with fish sauce and shrimp paste. Score. I also tried some papaya salad and once again, it was mounded in fish sauce and chili. Splendid. Then I had the minced beef phad kaprow (which is not on the menu) and lo and behold, I was tasting Phuket in a Bangkok sort of way. To be honest... the sauces from each of these entrees mingle quite well. You can drizzle some of each dripping over rice and literally have an orgy in your mouth of Mormonic proportions. You can also bolster it with some more heat with their chili fish sauce, again drizzled all over your concoction. Let your adventurous mind roam free and order something outside the pad thai genre. It will pay off handsomely.~~#~1
This charming little place not only has the BEST custom spray tan around - they can also whiten your teeth and have a rotating selection of adorable summer dresses on the cheap! If you are sick of being orange or baking under the harmful uv rays check this place out! First time clients get a discount! I will never go anywhere else!~~#~1
The Boulders was a first class experience all around.  We stayed in a casita, which was one bedroom and had a sitting room w/fireplace (a letter on the table indicated they are no longer using the fireplaces for environmental concerns), a large bathroom and walk-in closet, and a patio with a table and four chairs.  For the ladies, there is a vanity with lighted mirror just off the bathroom.  My only small complaint about the casita was that the shower was a bit small.  The mini-bar seems to be a thing of the past, but the Boulders still features a well-stocked version with a half bottle of Cali wine, kettle cooked chips, water, soda and various liquor.  The villas were outrageous and would be great for a family reunion or that type of thing - multiple bedrooms, a large outdoor area for entertaining, with the garage (they're houses, really) converted to a bedroom.  If you're staying in a casita, it's a hike across the property to the villas - they'll take you in a shuttle bus.The bar near the dining room was well-stocked with several single malts, and the standard cigar list.  Walk out back through the seating area, and you'll find the pool, framed by a gorgeous backdrop of a large boulder and waterfall.  A little cool for the pool in December, but it didn't seem to hamper others' enjoyment.Looking forward to returning and enjoying more on-site amenities besides golf.  My girlfriend went to the spa for massage / pedicure and seemed pretty relaxed - what I gathered is that she enjoyed it.There are places with cushier accommodations, but the property it sits on is what makes the Boulder's unique.~~#~1
I don't think I have ever been to a restaurant where I have treated so poorly by the wait staff. I'm actually rethinking my Green rating because I sincerely think this is my worst restaurant experience.The one good thing I can write is that this place is really cute and it has an inviting patio. Lots of string lights and cute bistro tables. I really thought I was in for a great evening. Oh how wrong I was.My friend and I walked in and the hostess immediately sat us at a four top right in front of the door. Unless the restaurant is packed and the drafty table in front of the door is the last spot available, I do not want to sit in a place where incoming guests will constantly bump into my chair. I pointed to a seat in the back and after trying to convince me I didn't want *that* table, the hostess led us to the back. It's not the worst thing that could ever happen and that instance did not ruin my evening, it was just weird.We sat and were greeted by our waitress, who initially seemed very nice. We both ordered water to start and I asked her for a drink menu. Apparently the drink menu is on the back of the regular menu. It's just so small that I missed it the first time. She told me that Friday night is the $4 frozen house margarita night, so I went with her suggestion. By the time I finish pulling out my ID, my dining partner was ready to order. We got a queso appetizer, the vegetarian tacos with a side salad, and the machaca plate.While we waited, a few more groups came in, were greeted, and received their adult beverages. It had been ten minutes since I ordered my drink, so I tried to look for our waitress. She finally popped up five minutes later, but avoided all eye contact with our table. When she did see me, she quickly ran outside. I understand she might have had a few tables outside, but why have an inside section to wait as well? The table right next to us had an amazing server who brought them two orders of drinks in the time it took to get my water glass refilled. (Margarita was still MIA at this point.)Then, the queso came out, brought by two hipsters. It looked like an over-microwaved styrofoam plate in a skillet and tasted just as bad. My friend tried to make the best out of the situation, but I was ready to call the manager. I really, really regret that I did not. Nasty queso juice dripped all over the table and there was no silverware or napkins to be found. AND no wait persons or a hostess to ask for said items. (Twenty minutes after I ordered my margarita, it was still MIA.)Our waitress finally popped up and asked how the appetizer was. My friend cut me off and said it was different, but okay. He took rare this opportunity to ask for silverware. The waitress made an excuse that it should have been on the table already and went to grab some.  When she came back, I asked about my drink.With another lame excuse that could have been avoided if she ever check on us in the then-thirty minute absence, she finally brought me my drink. It was OKAY, not worth $4... more like $2-3. Two seconds later, the food came out. At least we had silverware?1) My veggie tacos and side salad were okay. Is it bad that the BEST part of meal was the white, iceberg lettuce salad?2) My friend's machaca was bone dry. Isn't machaca supposed to be tender, rehydrated, and edible? All in all, the salsa was the best part of the meal. Yet, one cannot enjoy a dining experience on salsa alone. This was sincerely my worst experience at a restaurant and I will not go back to Mucho Gusto.~~#~1
We just moved from Florida and I was looking for a Restaurant with great food, service and a great view to celebrate my husbands 61st Birthday on Friday. It was suggested by a friend to try A Different Point of View... We are so glad we did... Let start by saying the drive up the cliffs to the restaurant was an adventure my Kia wasn't happy about but we made it.. AMAZING views... Greeted by a valet who had plenty of energy and was very informative. We picked the elevator to go to the 4th floor as opposed to the stairs... We were seated in a corner window table with views beyond belief! Greeted by our server , Larry, he wished my husband Happy Birthday and brought a passion fruit drink that was delish compliments of the Chef! Nice touch... Ask for Larry if you go.. he was right in tune with our special requests... We ordered their Signature Salad and I said we would share it... Larry had the kitchen serve it as a split.. Larry made the dinner and celebration very Special. My husband ordered the Rib Eye but my husband doesn't like any thing on his rib eye and doesn't like anything else on his plate with the meat.. Larry must hears this all the time and he explained exactly how it will be plated and assured him that no sauce or veggies would touch the meat. See pictures to see our meals. I held my breath until the plates came out and my Husband loved it- it was perfect. He ordered it medium rare and it came out perfectly cooked and full of flavor and it cut like butter. I ordered the Pork Tenderloin and it was tender and full of flavor the corn cakes were like little polenta pancakes they were delishish... The bread and the specialty butter and pesto and goat cheese dips were also full of flavor... The dessert was a Chocolate Espresso cake also very good. The sun was setting and the lights were twinkling-- Just a wonderful experience.. I can't wait to go back when it's a little cooler to sit outside...Don't miss this wonderful casual affordable piece of Heaven!~~#~1
Great experience at Citizen PH...highly recommend the food and ambience trust me well worth the price!!~~#~1
You know when you get a really good cut and color.. When the stylist is done and you look in the mirror and say "Wow, you did a great job. It looks awesome".Well that was my experience yesterday. I was a bit hesitant to go to the training academy, but in these rough economic times every penny counts and their prices are fantabulous.  It is really hard to find someone that does a great job on your hair the first time you see them. My stylist was Sara Groves and I am now a customer for life. I have the feeling she is going to have a very lucrative career doing hair, too bad her prices will triple in a few months. She sat me down and asked me all about my hair, my style, the products I use ect. The best part of the entire experience was that she really listened to me and cut my hair exactly how I asked. I wanted peek-a-boo highlights in my bangs, and even though she thought it was an odd choice (and asked me if I was sure a few times ;) she gave them to me. I was extremely pleased with both my cut and color. When the receptionist rang me up I almost couldn't believe the price.. Cut and color for under $50.. WOW!~~#~1
I love the story time program here! I started coming this summer after having a baby and wanting to get my toddler out of the house while beating the heat. The staff here is amazing! It is a 30 minute session of singing, dancing, stories and bubbles. We look forward to this every week now. My daughter loves the take home cut out and coloring sheet. The first thing she does is come home and color it. I am so thankful for this free program.~~#~1
Super cool, cookie/cake.chocolate maker haven!  :)  Totally worth the 40 minute drive I had - it was packed when I got there and I did not experience one little bit of rudeness.  I arrived with my 5yo and after cruising the aisles for a bit an employee came by to see if I needed help finding anything.  Super neat place!  :)~~#~1
I like the Thai Hut because it is safe Thai eating. They have some of the more adventurous authentic Thai, and then they have what I ALWAYS get - The Garden Delight with beef. Just basically vegetables and beef cooked in a marinade. They always have plenty of servers on hand and I've never been disappointed. There's just some little sparkle that it seems to be missing.I struggled between giving it a 3 or a 4, but I settled on a 3 because they could definitely improve the atmosphere a little bit and parking sucks. They are really close to the light rail now though, just get off at McDowell/Central and walk one block east on McDowell.~~#~0
ouchh...my fuckin head is pounding this morning.  thanks a lot guys!~~#~1
When in the mood for bagels I go to Einstein's with my several year old yellow Einstein Brothers stainless coffee mug.  I pick up an AZ Republic and order a toasted good grains bagel with garden veggie.  I usually have the bagel in a basket by the time I get to check out or at worst when I am filling the coffee mug.  The coffee is mellower than my usual Starbucks but compliments the bagel.  Einstein's draws both the young and mature and I enjoy the ability to read the paper at my leisure either inside or outside in the morning shade.~~#~0
God Bless Lifetime Fitness.First off, let me tell you how much I despise working out.  Like, at times I'd rather drink my own pee than even come within 50 feet of the stair stepper.  However, LTF (have you noticed that I like to abbreviate?  Get used to it friends...)  makes my gym experience fairly painless.  Steve W, I salute you for aknowledging the value of such a fine work-out establishment, and I actually have many of the same opinions. But because I like to hear myself talk, I'll reiterate some of my favorite points.First off, I'm absolutely not a fan of children.  Especially at a gym.  Lifetime has FREE childcare for kiddos 12 and under so us singles can flirt our way through our workout without your kids sniffling and screaming.  Kids can play and swim outside under parental supervision at the pool, complete with waterslides and some kid-specifc water fountain spray thing.  They love it.  And I do too.  WATERSLIDES?  I mean come on.  LoveitLoveit.Lifetime's members span the board, which is nice because I like the fact that I'm not the most out of shape person there.  I also like that there is nice scenery to watch and inspire me to keep my feet on that god forsaken stair stepper.  You may even see a professional athelete or TV personality on occasion.  Who doesnt love that?You never wait for a piece of equipement because there are tons of machines.  And they are not covered in meathead sweat, which is always nice.My favorite part of LTF is the group classes.  Excellent teachers, classes every day of the week, and a good variety of options.  I'd like to see more coreographed classes like Hip-Hop, but whatever, Kickboxing Jam is pretty damn close.   Locker rooms are always spotless, towel service is free, sauna and steam rooms arent full of weirdo naked people, and they have this device that dries your bathing suit in under a minute.  Ingenious!  I've been a member of a ton of Scottsdale gyms but I drive the extra 20 minutes in rush hour to go to the Tempe LTF.  Doesnt road rage burn calories anyway??  Win-win situation.~~#~1
One of our Lexus car keys/key fob was cracked and needed to be replaced. Going to the dealer would be anywhere from $250-$400! I found Alcatraz on Yelp and called Todd. Todd did exactly what he said had to be done and the charge was $75.00. Todd is knowledgeable and knows what he is doing. Most other locksmiths couldn't do the job because they don't have the machine necessary to fabricate the key. I am a home inspector in the Phoenix metro area, and before I left with my new key, I took more than a few of Todd's business cards that I plan to give to my clients, so that when they move into their new home, they can call someone who is reliable, knowledgeable and trustworthy to help with their home security.  Thanks, Yelp, as I found Alcatraz on your site.~~#~1
I love sakana. They have the best lunch time happy hour! Its always delicious and seriously reasonably priced. :)~~#~1
Hard to find New York pizza that tastes like New York pizza.  All the way from Morristown, NJ, this place is now the only place I order NY style pizza.~~#~1
I was here for the Yelp event recently and loved it.  The facility was great and Yelp did a good job putting together the event.  I noticed there was a lot to do there.  I am already planning to come back with my nephews so I can have fun walking around the mock grocery store.  I'm also looking forward to racing my nephews through the car wash on tricycles.  Bring energy when you come and prepare to have fun.~~#~1
Empty tables. Told 15 minute wait. Ok. 5 minutes into wait (by the door, bumping elbows with counter patrons), 2 people at the counter complained they had been there 20 minutes. We left at that point~~#~1
Not a company to do business with ... From my experience !'~~#~1
I wouldn't send my worst enemy to this place.~~#~1
I do enjoy a good bowl of Pho.   This was -not- a good bowl of pho.grey chicken meat., off tasting broth, old bean sprouts, 1 piece of a jalepeno pepper... dingy insides.  Weird looks from the server.  I don't think I'll be back.  Not much else I can say~~#~1
Had a bad day yesterday and decided my health-conscious lunch would *not* cut it as far as getting me through my work day. I've always loved VSC & have had their menu at my desk but I hadn't been in a while. Put an order together w/ some co workers & called. I was read to go pick it up, but then they told me THEY DELIVER! I don't believe they did the last time I'd been there. Went out on a limb & tried the Dead Head wrap - soooo good and WELL worth the price b/c it's huge. I almost took off a star b/c their pasta salad is NOT what it used to be. I don't know if they changed it or if they are just inconsistent in making it, but it was kind of embarrassing that I'd told my coworkers how awesome it was just to have it come out not so great.~~#~1
What can I say I love AJs especially the Boulangerie or coffee bar.  Jason is the best.   The pineapple ice tea with a slice of pineapple is deli-sh with a yummy cheese croissant.  I admit I usually get something from the coffee bar and bistro more so than the actual grocery store.  Oh and if you go check out the display/decorations they are usually pretty cool.~~#~1
Well what can I say about this place?  The restaurant is located in an upscale commercial complex with boutiques and an AJ's in the middle of Arrowhead Ranch.  Definitely doesn't have the boring suburban feel which you get along Bell Road only a mile away.  The inside has exposed brick on the walls with sleek looking seating.  Each food item comes out looking like a self made creation from the chef.  I have to say the Marguerite pizza is one of my favorites.  Having a crispy crust and savory flavors that make my mouth want to eat more, more, and more.  But I don't need to eat more because I fill my mouth with a good wine.  I had  a Dutton Estate Chardonnay(I think) which was half off on this day which kept me happy.  This place did not fail me.So will I be back?  Umm that's a yes!~~#~1
Most horrible buffet I have ever been to.My boyfriend and I are big chinese buffet fans. A ton of them have raised their prices recently (and, not surprisingly, have been closing down left and right).. so the prospect of a good buffet at 5-8 dollars was absolutely amazing. We read all the reviews on yelp and I had high hopes.Dear lord. The food is awful here. Inedible. Tastes very distinctly like a bad frozen dinner.  The only thing I remember being remotely food-like was some kind of beef and onion dish.. which tasted a bit like a philly cheesesteak. not exactly asian fare..I tried really hard to like this place. My boyfriend didn't like any of it either. I don't understand how they have such good ratings. The ONLY thing I like about this place is their dessert bar, because they have toppings for the frozen yogurt. It always annoyed me how so many buffets don't even have sprinkles.. so they've got that going for them.. though I think I'll just go to Mojo or Yogurtland. haha.In short, I don't understand how anyone can eat this garbage.~~#~1
Fantastic.  Absolutely fantastic.  I recommend OHSO for anyone looking to dine at a neighborhood bar and grill. I was really shocked when I dined at OHSO for a Sunday brunch.  I figured the variety of beers would be the focal point of the brewery; boy, was I wrong.  This place has some of the best dishes in Scottsdale supported by a huge selection of beer.  Let me say this with more clarity: great food differentiates this place, not the huge variety of beers.  This is a great achievement considering many breweries focus on providing rare beers with mediocre food.  The "Burger + Cheese" is simply awesome.  A GREAT brunch dish is the "Breakfast Burrito" as well as the "Breakfast Flatbread."~~#~1
SALSA BAR RAID!  that is exactly why I do when I am at this place. The salsa bar is the main attraction for me. There are many great salsa options, plus fresh cilantro and peppers. Some of the salsas are good enough to be eaten straight, like the mango salsa, it makes a good desert.The menu for this place is somewhat somewhat limited t mostly burritos and tacos. Recently the menu was revised and the cheaper items were removed and more expensive ones were added in their place.Every meal comes with a small side of chips, which adds even more use to the salsa bar. The grilled green onion that used to come with each meal is gone and missed.~~#~0
Haus Murphy's was my first German food experience ever. The cuisine was OK but it isn't something I'd shove people down to get to. I went with a friend who lived in Germany for a bit and he said that Murphy's wasn't quite up to par. We ordered the sausage sampler as an appetizer. The sausages were tasty, but they were a bit cold. For something that is labeled a "sampler", I felt disappointed with only two types of sausages served in it. I don't know for sure what types they were, but they didn't taste unique to me, as it seems like you can purchase them in the meat section of any supermarket. The sausages were served with three types of condiments. A sweet style mustard, a Dijon style mustard, and ketchup blended with curry, which I'm told is a recent favorite of the German kids brought over from Turkish immigrants. For our entrees, we all had some type of schnitzel. That same friend told me to try the Wiener schnitzel as it is the representative item when you think of German cuisine. So all our schnitzel's came out and mine was the blandest. My friend's schnitzels had different gravies, toppings, and stuff and my poor little Wiener schnitzel was just bland and all alone. You have to get that Wiener schnitzel wet with gravy ! No biggie, I'm a foodie so I'll eat it. A schnitzel is basically German country fried pork. Not super exciting. I copied my friend who lived in Germany and substituted potatoes on the side for spatzle, as I wanted this experience to be as authentic as possible. I don't know if it's just Haus Murphy's, but the spatzle was kind of bland, even with the gravy. I do however like the word spatzle. If I ever visited Germany, I would only say spatzle, to everyone. I also liked the other thing that was served with the entree. It was kind of like a mashed potato mixed with some creme sauce, onions and some kind of green vegetable or herb (probably spinach). The beer here was good authentic German beer. I didn't get drunk, but I still don't remember what kind I had, you'll have to experiment. Service was excellent. I read some reviews that said Murphy's was slow but everything came out quickly and evenly for us. The waitress was very friendly and they spoke lovely German (not that I speak ANY German, but it sounded sexy). She was very helpful in describing everything, from the food to the beer.I ordered a BAP (big ass pretzel) to go. Philly is known for some pretty good pretzels and this BAP was good. It was expensive, but it came out warm, soft & chewy. The only thing is they went a little heavy on the salt. To steal and modify a quote from a Seinfeld episode: "That big ass pretzel made me thirsty"!  Note* They don't actually have it on the menu as a BAP.Would I return to Murphy's? Ehhh, yeah to try some of the other things, but I definitely can't see it as a place that I would be a regular at.~~#~0
These guys are great!  They have helped me with bulbs needs for both my home and office.  Easy to work with and good prices.  Thanks!~~#~1
Seriously need a remodel, but totally worth the money due to the free 24hr shuttle in a 5 mile radius!! Nice staff. Clean. Just worn down a bit...~~#~0
The cajun seasoning on my salad was terrible, but everything else was just fine. But food aside, I'd come here again for the atmosphere. It's not my scene, but I enjoyed how friendly the waitress was. I was surprised that she didn't know what an old fashioned was (my barometer of how good a bar is), but the bartender did and gave me a drink that was well balanced, but needed way more alcohol. Old fashioneds are not orange and look and taste like juice!It was fun watching the girl buck around on the mechanical bull. I have a feeling that the operator liked jiggling her around for a reason though...All in all an enjoyable dinner with friends.~~#~0
One of my favorite places  to get Indian food. I'm vegan so I love that there is so much  to choose from. My all time favorite is the chili gobi and vegetable manchurian. I'm so glad Udupi reopened.~~#~1
I suppose you could just put me in the "box" with "Luis T" on 3.20.10...because if i didnt know any better, his could have been my entry.. So i was here this week.  Let me start by saying i have been giving Los Dos Molinos my  business for almost 20 years now, and each year that goes by i find myself saying that i am going to cease my patronage.  I will save the stories from the recent years and why i've been feeling this way, and give you just the specifics from my most recent visit:  If you want to make the rule that there are "No Split Checks" then can you AT THE VERY LEAST get with the current times and make the bill somewhat decipherable?  We had a large party, and were quite promptly advised there were no split checks, yet at the end of the night we were left with a ribbon of calculator tape with ONLY prices, and no correlation with actual menu items...so we had to cross reference the menu to figure out what the heck all the itemizations correlated to.   And by the end of it, we pretty much gave up and just guessed at what each person should contribute because the receipt may have just as well been in morse code.  Ok, im getting ahead of myself..Its one thing if you have subpar service and the restaurant is slammed, understaffed, there is a MLB baseball game or NBA basketball game, or concert going on...This was not the case.  We were the ONLY table inside the restaurant and the service absolutely sucked.  How many times must one flag down the server for (take your pick) A;  refill on chips B: refill on ice water and C:(most importantly since the drinks are marked up 300%) a FRESH DRINK!!! Oh yes and D: Check please.  We had to look over our shoulders for A , B, C, and D.  When our table collectively decided the service was ridiculous we decided the tip would reflect that, and then we realized an 18% gratuity was included...well no wonder.  When that is the case, there is NO incentive for decent service!! We brought several items to the attention of the bald headed caucasian man who may have been a manager of some sort but his severe lack of customer service skills merely resulted in him stating in a childish voice "They are complaining about the service" to an audience that didnt exist.  Damn right! and damn right we will take our business elsewhere.  Grandma Chavez is rolling in her grave! you should be ashamed!~~#~1
Market Bistro never leaves me disappointed. The people are great.The food is ALWAYS good & it doesn't matter what you get, they will cater to your needs & wants.Definitely a must if your coming to Phoenix or if you live here, you need to try it.~~#~1
Wow...  I regress into some sort of '90s Valley Girl stereotype when chirping in delight over how good Switch is! How I was missing  a review for a Short List restaurant that I recommend to ev-er-yyyyy one I meet who is new to Phoenix and even remotely cool!?Switch is reliably good food served in a reliably good atmosphere by reliably good servers. The combination of service, setting and grub makes Switch a go-to for affordable dining that has appeal for a wide variety of people. If I think that someone might be too uptight or too culinarily 'safe' to really enjoy Fez I know that I can take them to Switch, they can hone in on comfort food basics and I will still have an enjoyably awesome dining experience myself because all the basics are done with love, care and actual effort. I think I prefer Switch's menu to Fez's because of the combination of classic choices mixed in with flavor play and more diverse fare. And we end up at Switch a lot because they have awesome outdoor loungey space which works for friends who are smokers and for a quieter, more intimate chic and cool dinner-drinks and gossip night. It's really a gift to have this place in Downtown and a real gem in the Valley overall.We have on occasion had our asses kicked by the bar, specifically by the Drunken Italian Sodas which are so very, very good!~~#~1
Love their pizza and atmosphere. Their Caesar salad is really good too. They had a great deal during the summer, where we got 2 salads, 1 large pepperoni pizza and a bottle of wine for $40.~~#~1
Food used to be a lot better, service too. Not awful though.~~#~0
I recommend making OpenTable reservations, as this place is small. I had a great dining experience and I enjoyed the drinks and food. Margaret (sp) was a great server.I like to dine at local places like this, particularly those that make their drink mixes in house and use locally sourced food [when possible].The drinks I had were great: Aloe Arizona, The Kingston Rum Punch and Piña Colada ReduxI had a dish with red snapper and vegetables; which was excellent. I had rice and peas on the side, the rice was not the best however; it seemed too dry.My friend had the prawns, I did not taste it, but the presentation looked good. She also had the coconut water which was served in a coconut - it was great and she mentioned it complimented the prawn dish.For desert I had a Créme Brûlée made with pineapple and rum.~~#~1
This is a really fun place to grab some cocktails or beers before an event or game. My friends and I have a tradition of drinking here before DBACKS games and we always love it. Drinks are reasonable, especially if you ask the specials, and way cheaper than beers at BOB. As for food they have an awesome menu, but the food came off a bit cheap in quality to me so I don't think it's worth ten dollars a plate. But if your hungry it will get the job done! Although...one of the days I want to try and eat one of those One Pound hot dogs they have. It is a personal goal. I recommend:Fox Sports MargBeersGrape Bombers~~#~0
Fantastic place!  we went tonight for my friends birthday-they were able to seat 15 of us without a problem.  Our waiter, Tim, was fantastic-he split the checks for everyone before we even asked.  They gave the birthday girl two pieces of delicious dessert on the house.  The food was great-we were all surprised by how large the portions were for the price.  Everyone was very polite and accommodating I look forward to going back!~~#~1
This place is the truth. It is easily one of the absolute best spots in Phoenix for Sonoran style Mexican cuisine. The chile colorado is so good, it made me try to slap my mama. The red sauce with the chips is actually brewed in the sixth level of hell. Awesome. Fridays feature $1.99 margaritas before 7 p.m. Swing by, start with the cheese crisp, grab any combo and revel in the gluttony.~~#~1
We enrolled our son in this program. It was EXCELLENT! Of our three children who have learned to drive we have observed that he is the most safety conscious and the best "new" licensed driver.Thank you, Driving MBA, for the peace of mind you have given us.~~#~1
Was an interesting way to spend an hour.  Lots of displays but very dusty on the inside of the cases.  Quite and peaceful; a nice place to hang out for awhile.  I showed up about 40 minutes before closing and she didn't charge me the $2 but I donated $3 since they operate only on donations.  The table set with rocks and minerals was fun to check out.  I would go back again when I wasn't short on time and explore upstairs.~~#~0
I love this place. The food is clearly made with love and the folks there are so inviting and warm.  Great vibe. Great food. Great price. You can bet the next time I visit Phoenix, I'll be coming back to Tiny's ;)~~#~1
Kind of surprised myself, but I have to give them a five.  Let's begin with the drink was excellent.  I had some kind of pom martini that was one of the best I've had in a while.  I ordered the sirloin steak cobb salad.  My salad arrived two minutes after the people I was eating with, and it was taken off the bill....they also brought us a free dessert and apologized...really?  That's good service.  They may have even gone overboard, but I didn't complain.  The food itself was excellent.  I loved my salad, and it was a nice size portion.  All in all, a great experience.~~#~1
Awesome carne asada, veggie taco and just about everything else.  Delicious and very easy on my wallet.~~#~1
This is the best record store in Tempe, hands down.  Second best in the Valley (after Tracks in Wax).  I have been collecting records for almost 30 years now, and have been going to Eastside for about half that time - at least since I could conveniently drive out to the east valley, and regularly since I moved to this end of town about 10 years ago.  I remember the fish tank with the moray eel and the fact that the plaza they are in used to let them have twice the space.It amazes me that they have survived all this time.  And, boy, am I glad they have.  A good chunk of my collection, and even my current turntable, has come from here.  If I ever won the lottery, I would probably spend enough money in one day here to keep the place in business for another few decades.  Heck, I'd even buy them a bigger place if I could!  This is one of the last truly independent record stores.  I'm happy to support them, and I hope everyone else will continue to do so as well.Edit: They closed down on 12/31/10.  I'm going to miss them.  Hopefully they'll reopen somewhere else, even if it is only online.  My regret is that I didn't have enough money to do one final run through there.~~#~1
Not recommended if you're not white. For me, it's the third time somebody threw out racial slurs at my group. I am beginning to think the place is for rednecks and the like. D&B bowling lanes are better.~~#~1
Let's talk about failure, baby.Hey, if your idea of salad is punishment via tasteless lettuce and mealy tomatoes splashed with the most generic, industrial vinaigrette, you've found just the right place to BDSM your tongue. Go for it!I ordered Capellini Checca, and I had it substituted with Spaghetti (I like more girth re: pasta).  What I got was the limpest pile of spaghetti that couldn't be revived with a lifetime supply of Viagra.  The DOA pasta was topped with a pathetic sprinkling of more mealy tomatoes (the menu says Fresh Roma Tomatoes- these had the texture and taste of a dying horse's ass moreso than fresh produce).  The faint, acrid garlic tasted like it came out of a shaker bottle and not a bulb- and motherf*&k, respectable Checca should have more than 1/16 teaspoon of microscopically chopped basil.  This place makes Old Spaghetti Factory look like fine dining, and I would rather starve than be even close to that chain restaurant of culinary doom.  Hell, this place is the  disowned, cracked-out junkie brother of OSF. It's really *that* terrible.I gave them the single star only because the management was incredibly lovely, and did not charge for the unforgivable disaster masquerading as edible food worth paying for.~~#~1
Typical Taco Bell with typical Taco Bell menu (other than the Popeye's Fish they serve from the same kitchen/counter). Not sure if some of the people in the kitchen could speak English. One employee on break sat in front of a small TV in the seating area which was VERY LOUD and ANNOYING. Every table was dirty despite it not being very busy, and the bottles of condiments at the "fixin's" bar were filthy. Can't beat the prices, though. As usual, I left "stuft" on two bucks.~~#~0
This place is awesome. A cornish pasty is like a big calzone stuffed with whatever you choose. They have many choices and all regular choices are also available as vegetarian entrees. These are HUGE so come hungry! Their tomato soup is also good but I would definitely stick to a pasty if you want a delicious meal.The place is pretty divey but in a really great way. I have also heard they are expanding so those of you who have complained about their cramped quarters may find some reprieve soon. Personally, I like the small dark divey feel.They also serve Rogue beer which is delicious if you haven't tried it. I like this place so much I eat there whenever I am in the area, which has prevented me from trying many other places nearby but I cant seem to bring myself not to go to Cornish as it is so good every time.Highly recommend it if you are in the area.~~#~1
Huge fan of Bikram yoga! It's a 90 minute, torturous-at-times, sweat-filled  workout but when you are done, you feel insanely amazing. The feeling continues throughout the day leaving you in complete zen....Road rage? Gone. Annoying food cravings? Zero. Jeans? Fitting awesome. You really must try it, it can completely change your body.There are a few places in the valley that offer Bikram, most of them exclusively rather than in combo with other methods of yoga. The Bikram Institute on Miller and Indian School is where I first tried it, and I like it the best so far. They offer classes throughout the day and later in the evening as well. Like other studios, this place offers first timers a week-long pass for around $20. What I really like about this studio is their instructors and the fact that they keep their room darkened throughout the entire practice. I've have been going to another studio lately (for their first-time student deals) and their instructors bark out instructions non-stop plus they keep the lights on the whole time. So when you're staring up lying in your relaxed state, your eyes meet the glare of the fluorescent. I'll very likely return here after I've exhausted the new student deals at the studios around the valley. Yoga can be expensive!~~#~1
In 1999 the AZ Republic Voted Abacus Inn Best Chinese in the Valley. That is sad because Chinese can be so much better. But I do have to say that Abacus Inn does something nice that I don't see too often in other Chinese Restaurants. They give you hot tea and water and fresh fried noodles with sauces when you are seated. I had the Yui Shan Chicken, it was a fail because of the inedible Shiitake Mushroom stems in my dish.  Trying to eat the mushroom stem was like trying to chew a car tire but, I do have to admit the sauce was more developed than any sauced dishes I tried from the surrounding Chinese Restaurants including Bamboo Cafe, Ginger China Bistro, and Shangri La. I LIKED the use of cucumber in the dish was light and tasty and successful. Unfortunately the white meat chicken was dry. Maybe a THIRD STRING cook was on the day I was here and maybe this dish is normally prepared better?The sautéed spicy beef was more successful. The beef was very well prepared and unlike the Yui Shan dish this Spicy Beef REALLY WAS VERY SPICY. I am used to a more developed and balanced Szechuan sauce so I wasn't a fan of this dish from here. But I do note this sauce was better than what you'd get from surrounding Chinese Restaurants.The last time I was here I had the sizzling rice dish and that one impressed me because they cook the rice quickly in a very hot oil and puff the rice.It's a toss up between Abacus Inn and Shangri la . Abacus does some more impressive stuff but Shangri la does cook moist chicken.~~#~0
Excellent food and service!~~#~1
GREAT PLACE TO HANG OUT AND WATCH THE SCENERYWith a little help you can drink & choose from about 25 beers, 8 scothes,10 whiskeys,8 Really good tequila's (just ask me) along with the every day vodka's & some pretty impresive wines (or whines).Don't miss this little gem in the rough & com listen to music or watch sports or just drink. Oh yea the owners are OK also~~#~1
Love this place.  Great staff!  Friendly, fun and knowledgable.  The food is always good.~~#~1
What started out as a simple attempt to find a perfect birthday present turned into a life-long relationship with a fantastic jeweler. I wanted to get my fiancé (girlfriend at that time) a simple diamond pendant necklace for her birthday and could not find anything that even came close to matching her style. I searched the internet for days and reluctantly went into a few jewelry stores hoping for the best, but expecting the worst. I, like most people [guys] out there, had a bad feeling in a few stores I went to. Pushy sales people looking for the upsale, and sky high prices. I was getting very discouraged about the process, but that all changed when I came to Hyde Park. The super friendly staff made everything easy for me. There was no pushy sales process or anyone trying to upsell me something I didn't want. They immediately offered me a bottle of water and started to talk to me like a real person. After a few minutes of speaking with a very lovely woman in the store she suggested we think about something custom. At first  I was thinking "here we go; this is where I am going to get stuck!", but I was all wrong!!!We looked a few loose stones and I got a great education about diamonds. I went home later that night and did some research on the internet and found that the prices we as good, or better than any of the big online retailers. I could never get my head wrapped around buying a diamond online, sight unseen, and I am so glad that I found Hyde Park. In the end I have used Hyde Park to create a custom pendant diamond necklace that my fiancé absolutely loves (it is perfect on her), and I also used Hyde Park to get the diamond for the engagement ring, as well as everything else to follow. Want to know what service is all about in the jewelry business, check out what Hyde Park did for me. I picked out an amazing diamond for the engagement ring (chose the loose stone again) but had no idea what kind of a ring my fiancé would want. So Hyde Park said "how about we just put it in a classic Tiffany solitaire setting as a temporary setting and then after you give it to her, you can come back in together and pick out the perfect setting and wedding band set". I was like, seriously?!! You can just do that???In the end Hyde Park will be my jeweler for life. They helped me create the perfect simple birthday present, and took that service all the way through doing a custom engagement ring and matching wedding band set. This is the jewelry store for any guy who wants great service, great prices, and like me, doesn't have the first clue about how to make the perfect decision. Just let Hyde Park take the stress out of it like they did for me!~~#~1
I have concerns about Heirloom. Not about the food, which is fantastic (not quite 5 star fantastic, but 4.5 star fantastic). Nor the service, which is friendly and helpful. Nor about the atmosphere (well, somewhat about the atmosphere...it's quite lackluster). My concern is that Heirloom claims to be fine dining for our current economic times, when $50 entrees seem obscene. But what they've done is create a menu of less expensive small plates where you need to order at least 3 per person to be totally full, so you end up spending as much if not more as you would at other high-end establishments. On my visit, the place was practically dead. Granted, it was a weeknight, but I can't see how a place can survive with only 3 of its probably 15+ tables occupied. Especially not in such a high rent location, where restaurants have dropped out like flies. The menu changes weekly, which is really nice if you go to a place often, but who could possibly afford to come here often?! If you do go, they have a $25 off coupon on their website. Not 25 percent...25 DOLLARS! I would love to return to Heirloom every month to try chef Michael DeMaria's latest culinary creations, but that's certainly not within my budget. I'm afraid others have the same problem and that this place won't be around for long. Therein lie my concerns, because I really did love my meal!~~#~1
I don't drink a lot of coffee, but I'm a fan of tea. Especially strange tea that I probably can't pronounce right. Oh, and I like it when it smells like scotch. Yep, I'm a fan of Lapsang Souchong.But I'm not a fan of "foofy". And that's one thing that Tea infusion is not. It's not foofy. It's funky. It's fun. And everyone who works there is really friendly.Beyond the teas, the food is good, too. I don't know that I'd eat there every night, but it's a wider variety than I'd expect at a tea place.This is a regular stop of mine. Makes Tempe Markeplace worth it!~~#~1
We came here for lunch and were a little leery when we first walked in. I had the cream of leek soup, my mother had the sausage salad, and my aunt had the Greek salad and we were all very impressed. We took a bangers and mash pasty to go, but we are so full, that it'll be awhile before we can try it. The service was a little slow, but the quality of food and atmosphere made up for the inconvenience.~~#~1
My son and I were in town and went by Pizzeria Bianco and didn't want to wait 2 hours, so while on the way back to the hotel, my son used Yelp and found this little gem. The pizza was pretty good, and I had a pasta special that was quite good. The owner was very attentive.The nearby table had ordered a large pizza, and they were served a slab that was 1' x 3' on a wooden plank. Very Impressive!The only negative is that the guy cooking the pizzas should let them get a little browner (maybe even a little char) to make the taste more authentic.~~#~0
After checking into our lovely suite at the Montelucia my hubby said he was in the mood for some chips, guac and a margarita. I think he had mistaken Scottsdale for Mexico and unfortunately the restaurant at The Montelucia (Prado) had none of the above. Instead we enjoyed a glass of wine (Riesling for me), a bowl of gazpacho and shared the snapper ceviche.  Service was a bit on the slow side, but the tasty food made up for it...We ended up back at Prado the next morning for breakfast- we were quite starving after hiking Camelback (or part of Camelback).  I was a bit disappointed with their breakfast menu. They had very few things to choose from besides the $25 breakfast buffet. I wasn't in a buffet kind of mood, but it didn't seem like we had a choice. However, I seemed to get the most out of my $25 after stuffing my face with an omlette, mini breakfast burrito, fruit, yogurt parfait, etc.  Our waiter did a bit of a disappearing act, but fortunately we didn't need him much for the buffet.They do have some good food, but they could use some more options...and better service.~~#~0
My husband called me from work one day after a coworker had brought in several dozen bosa donuts and he said, "I've just had the best donuts I've ever eaten". Me, being a pastry lover, had to give it a try. We went early one morning and got one of every donut they had, they were awesome! The place is a little hole in the wall and had I not been told to go, I probably would have never gone in. The donuts were soft and fresh, the cinnamon crumble one was my favorite, and they were also reasonably priced. We live in ahwatukee so it's a little out of our way, but we will definitely be coming here again!~~#~1
The theater itself I have no problem with. Its the fact that we came out of the theater to a broken out driver passenger window, my doors unlocked and some Dumb Ass broke into my car and didn't even take anything. Really?? I should've known better given the area but it was the only Harkins showing the movie we wanted to see. Security was nice enough to leave a note on my window.Can you believe there's No Cameras in the parking lot at all!! Ugh!!! Disappointed customer to say the least. Will not be back there that's for sure.~~#~1
I am a sucker for a theme restaurant. I have been wanting to visit this place for a while because of their whole gimmick. When you arrive a nurse checks you in, gives you a hospital wrist band, and dresses you in a hospital gown. Seriously, I love a gimmick more than the next person but the Heart Attack Grill is 100% gimmick and only 60% good food. The menu consists of burgers which vary only in the number of patties, french fries fried in lard, shakes, pure sugar coke, and PBR. They have a strict no sharing policy which completely bummed us out because we wanted to order the huge 20 patty burger and split it 3 ways. We ordered 2 single bypass burgers (one of our trio boycotted the burger because of the no sharing policy,) all you can eat lard fries, a vanilla shake, full sugar coke and a PBR. The burgers were ordinary, the fries were ordinary, and the service (aside from being dressed as naughty nurses) was ordinary. The only win was the delicious butterfat filled vanilla shake. The bill came to around $30, which is a bit pricey because remember only two of us actually had food. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it. It is a gimmick. Heart attack, fat, lard, waitresses dressed as nurses, cook dressed as doctors, sugar, beer...whatever. It gets old pretty fast.~~#~0
I took my daughter there to get her nose pierced for her birthday, they were very nice and professional and made her feel comfortable.  Its a nice shop and they were very friendly and did a great job.  I will definitely recommend them!~~#~1
Best Thai food!!!  Order the dry garlic chicken.~~#~1
Tried Shorty's today, sadly it will be my one and only visit. To begin service was mediocre at best, portions are small(I thought my steakburger was a slider), and there was also the black facial hair that was in between the cheese and burger. That's when customer service went down the drain, all we got was a "that's weird" and an I'm sorry. If your running a joint and a customer finds a big hair in their food you do whatever you can to save that customer and make them want to come back. Something, not just sorry for your luck. I will stick with RocketBurger, just up the street, cheaper, bigger portions, tasty and most important, they got great service. If I had to sum it up for ya in a few words I'd say"DON'T DO IT"!!!!~~#~1
San Felipe's Cantina will always have a special place in my heart. I've been coming here since it opened, and I haven't been disappointed yet! Here's some of my favorite things about them:Happy Hour - San Felipe's has one of the best happy hours in the valley. Their drinks and appetizers are half off from 4pm-7pm, and my bill for drinks and dinner with friends is typically $20-$30. You can't beat that!Service - I usually sit up at the bar when I stop by, and they have some of the friendliest bartenders in town! They always make me feel at home when I stop by, and they're quick to serve me during the late-night hours. The managers are also really good about hanging out and chatting with the customers to make them feel special. It works!Food and Drinks - My favorite drink at San Felipe's is probably the Mexican Iced Tea. It's a long island iced tea, but they use passion fruit vodka instead of the traditional unflavored vodka. As far as food goes, I REALLY like the baja chicken wrap, the sonoran chicken sandwich, and the steak burrito with green sauce. A quick tip - ANYTHING with the baja sauce is great :)Overall, this place is a lot of fun, and I really like the laid back vibe. I'll definitely be back!~~#~1
The PERFECT Breakfast :)  If only I could have this every day :)Matt's is all you want a breakfast spot to be...cute, friendly and the most amazing food out there.I highly recommend the hog and chick.  You just can't go wrong with eggs*, bacon*, home fries* (get the home fries, not the hashbrowns) and their toast* served with Terra Verde Farms preserves.  * = best ever, ever, everI could write on and on...you've seen the reviews.  Just make sure to make it there, you won't be sorry, you'll be addicted!~~#~1
North Valley always has interesting articles to read and cool interviews with people like Alice Cooper and Young MC (Bust a Move!).The magazine covers the entire north valley, which is very spread out. And you can find it in many different places, from Kierland to Anthem. It's free, but you can also get a subscription online.~~#~1
Ive been eating here more and more often lately, and I like the food.  If I want Mexican food, and I am in the downtown chandler area, this is where I stop in.The food quality is consistent.  Being a creature of habit, I get the same thing every time I come here.They are also serving cupcakes.  Looks like the change the flavor every once in a while too.  I have had a margarita flavored one, and a dark chocolate and chili one.  Tasty.~~#~1
First of all, if you go here, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make sure you check your bill when it comes!  honestly.  We went here 3 times.  all 3 times we were over charged....  either the menu's were out of date, or we were "past happy hour time" (BS)... oh and the other excuse... we just changed our menu.  blah blah blah  Pthen they always have to "get a manager" to come to the table, which takes forever!  (I am sure they hope we leave)  PLUS! THE SERVICE SUCKS ASS!!!!  this is a definitely bait and switch!1st time it happened we just dealt with it, and was like, whatever...2nd time it happened, my daughter who just got back from deployment (Navy) wanted to do something special for us and took us all there.  My husband looked at the check and noticed it wasy CRAZY over what we thought as we were there for happy hour.  The waitress had to get the manager which took over 20 minutes, (gimme a break)  finally we took a 30 dollar gift card because we were so sick of 'arguing about it.  We discussed it about 20 minutes and we were finally like, whatever...3rd time...  took a friend there.  again we ordered devils ale.  on the menu it was listed at one price... when we got the bill, it was almost twice as much.  We waited for our server to come back, she never did, she totally ignored us.  I gave her a dollar tip (which is NOT like me, i tip very well, too well)  and I wrote on the recept why she got such little money as a tip.  If you are looking for a fun time go caddy corner to San Filepe's  that place is fun and the staff are friendly and fun.  We much prefer there, we wll never go to Caddilac Ranch again.  They say 3rd time is a charm, Well, it is... its a charm to know you are overspending and its a big gimmick and they dont give a crap!oh and if i didn't have to give a star, i wouldn't have.~~#~1
The food was excellent ... the service not so much. A colleague and I took one of my clients here for a business dinner. The atmosphere was great, the food was outstanding but the service was embarrassing. It was a fun, Arizona type feeling restaurant and made quite the difference for my clients who are originally from Scotland. I had the roasted shrimp and grits. The grits were the best I have ever had (sorry North Carolina!). The shrimp portion was amazing. The dessert was great. I was surprised to see the offering of huckleberries. Sadly, the server forgot quite a bit of things. My client's wife ordered a second glass of wine to have for dinner, which was forgotten. We also asked for corn bread - the server forgot and brought it with our dessert. He tried to explain that it is made fresh to order and that is why it took so long.~~#~0
Go here if you live in AZ.  It fills the void in my life being a native Oregonian missing Deschutes Brewery.  I must admit though, I've only been here once because its a difficult place to dine with a 15 month old child.  Might want to get a babysitter for this one.~~#~1
Their emu oil is great.  I use it for inflammation of my jaw and shoulders, it's wonderful.  I highly recommend it.  We buy it at Fresh Vitamins in Mesa.  No dyes, fully refined, I love it.~~#~1
The problem with a place like this is the hype.  Five stars from yelpers, must be amazing!  But sorry, I've had better Eggs Benedict.  For me just too far to drive for the mediocre food and marginal service.~~#~0
Worst customer service of any grocery store I've ever been in.  EVER!  I'd rather go to any other Safeway or any other grocery store.  I'll drive the extra 10 miles just to avoid this place.~~#~1
Great authentic Greek food; excellent service.  We ordered a combination appetizer plate (hummus, dolmas, pitas, olives, spanikopita, etc).  It was a nice variety and filling for two.  The flaming cheese is festive.  The desert was a flaming custard that was just ok, but the ice cream and carmel made it better than average (plus the flaming part is always fun).  Only thing missing was breaking plates.  I'd definately go back if craving greek.~~#~0
I've only been to Postino's twice, both times for breakfast. And both times, I ordered the same thing: french toast. I'm not a big french toast kind of guy, but I absolutely loved them both times, and I look forward to the next brunch opportunity there. Might want to get here early though - we arrived at 9:30 on a Sunday and there were only a couple of tables still open. By 10am, there was a significant line.~~#~1
Best Italian sub I've had. Very nice owners. Just be aware there's no place to sit, so you'll have to get it to go.~~#~1
Nice resort located in downtown Chandler. The rooms are spacious and fairly comfortable . Chill by the pool and sip on a margarita from the pool bar.~~#~0
Decided to give this place a chance and was quite delighted. I am vegan and that's an issue sometimes. I tried the vegetable chow mein(medium spicy) and I love it. I get extra broccoli and there is so much flavor in the veggies and noodles. My husband has tried the General Tso's chicken, The BBQ pork chow mein, the mu shu pork and the garlic chicken and he loved them all. The great thing is that this is a family run business and it shows in the food. I highly recommend at least trying this place. it's reasonably priced and there are great lunch specials during the week.~~#~1
I really like this Urgent Care!  Don't let their youthful looks fool you! John Altic PA-C and Dr. Brenden McRae are wonderful and very caring! In addition to having Urgent Care they are now opening a Private Family Practice -I can't wait for them to be my primary care physicians as well.  Great job gentlemen and staff!~~#~1
So many great accessories and cute clothes! I got my accessories for my Wedding here, and they were perfect. Everything from clutches to earrings, from cute tops to watches, they have everything color coordinated!~~#~1
We went to dinner there on a Sunday and we were the only ones in there for most of our dinner. Downtown Phoenix can be somewhat quiet on the weekends, so this was no surprise. The service was great as was the food. I had a pizza and if you like thin, crispy crust you will enjoy the pizza as well. The music was a little loud for a Sunday dinner, especially since we were pretty much the only ones in the restaurant. I will go again, probably during the week so I can get a taste of what it is like when it is busy!! Overall...decent meal!~~#~0
Cant say enough good things about Sens. Excellent food and excellent service.~~#~1
Thought Saturday night would be busy at 6:00 PM, but to our surprise it was just getting started. We don't like to go there too often because it seems that a lot of older folks go there, not that I'm a "spring chicken".The waiter was efficient, he never told us his name but memorized our order. He made sure we had our drink glasses filled at all times.When he brought out the bread, it was only three pieces of different types: roll, carrot bread and another type. We had to ask for another order.My daughter had the Chicken Pot Pie which had chunks of chicken but the sad part, the crust was only on the top, which was golden brown. To her it was OKAY. My wife had the petite sirloin steak which came with a salad and asparagus. She ordered it medium rare and it was a little too pink, but still eatable. My order was the Lamb Shank on top of mashed potatoes and asparagus. Love asparagus!! The lamb was okay and portion was just right. The sauce that was poured over the lamb was like beef stew gravy with carrots and celery. The sauce was a bit salty for me but bearable. If you looked at the lamb shank you would mistaken it for a turkey drumstick.~~#~0
Okay, you might be asking yourself "who reviews a Taco Bell? or even looks up reviews for Taco Bell?" Well, I would ask myself that if I were you, but here we are.This Taco Bell is awesome. They have really nice and friendly people working for them, and my husband and I would eat inside because we liked the service. We lived a block away, and came every so often over 3.5 years and it was always the same. We appreciate that kind of good service, and it's not one you would expect to get from a fast-food chain.~~#~1
It is great.  Great ambiance, food, and service.  I love the rooftop bar too.~~#~1
My daughter's 128i BMW was horribly keyed this summer and we found Harvil's through State Farm Insurance. Fred Harvil was very friendly and helpful to work with and we really appreciated his service. She dropped her car off on Monday I believe and she had the car back by Friday. His rates were very good and ended up being lower than we had expected, and what we liked about him is that he was very honest. My daughter had accidentally backed her car into a pole earlier that summer and hadn't gotten it fixed because she kept getting quoted around $500 and couldn't do that, but because Harvil was already going to fix the rest of the car he only charged her $100 to repair the back bumper which was really nice. He also set us up with a rental car for her through Hertz that she was able to leave there at the shop and have them pick up which was great and convenient. All in all, Fred Harvil was very pleasant to work with, timely, and left her car looking like new. Definitely recommend!~~#~1
I wouldn't go here. In fact, I looked into attending Ai of Phoenix for a graphic design degree and decided it was not the path I needed (or wanted). The decision came, though, after a couple months of trying to sort things out with them. I applied. I met with a career counselor. I had to submit some more paperwork. I went on a tour. I then was sent to meet a financial adviser, who had to be barely 18. That's when I realized that the majority of these students were young, inexperienced and knew to college life. I, on the other hand, already had a degree. I was looking to combine my past experience with a design degree to enhance my career. I also realized Ai isn't willing to working with professional students. They don't take into consideration your work schedule as much as they should, especially if they want to appear accommodating and understanding to students who are truly committed to going to Ai. Case in point: In order to get the "a-ok" to take only 9 credit hours a semester, I would have had to get the permission of the Graphic Design Faculty Advisor - or something. Ai really pushes a full-time schedule on its students, even if they offer evening classes. Silly. Plus, I didn't like being treated like an idiot. I mean, do I have to tell you over and over again that I already have a degree, that I know what to expect from paperwork and financial aid? Can you not see I'm annoyed at some 18 year-old who can't operate a computer to tell me what my cost would be per semester? Can you not tell I'm irked when I make known I'm on my lunch break, and I'm told it'll be another hour before we're finished? I don't like somebody wasting my time. True, I can be impatient. But this was ridiculous.That's when I decided this place wasn't for me. Sure, I've heard great things about it, but the people who have gone here have told me I could have gotten a comparable degree and built a better portfolio somewhere else. Enough said.~~#~0
Introduced to D'lish today by a friend. I'd already had breakfast (although the menu looks great, lots of delicious sounding, healthy options) but he suggested a Chai coffee. I don't usually like Chai Tea, but I thought I'd give the Chai coffee a chance based on his recommendation.When I ordered, the server suggested a "Sexy Dirty Chai", which as lurid as it sounds means adding vanilla. The Sexy Dirty Chai Coffee over ice is hands down now my favorite coffee drink. The place is tiny, has a really cool, funky interior and also has a drive thru- a true local gem. The service is friendly and energetic and I plan to start my day here again soon :)~~#~1
We love this place. We got Miss V washed up with the highest package with an extra leave-in conditioner for her super shedding coat AND she got some hand baked peanut butter doggie treats (all for $22). SO worth it. Plus: all the employees are SO nice! And now that they are starting to carry her dog food (Blue Buffalo), we'll be headed to Wag N' Wash for her chow too.  LOVE.~~#~1
It is almost impossible to find a great sandwich shop that actually has good grinders and sandwiches.  Well my search is over.  I stumbled across this little shop and felt right at home in New England.  Being from Connecticut, I was so excited to see all the great food on the menu.  I had the Vermonter and it was bliss at every bite.  The owners are extremely friendly and you can tell that they want you to be very happy with their food and service.  Great food and great service, you will not be dissapointed....~~#~1
LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE!  always need to find a reason to drive so far to Chandler:-)  so fresh, soup delish, and sauces yummy!!! BYOB, and casual...feels like my grandmas:-)~~#~1
If I hadn't recently found Yogurtland in Scottsdale I would be raving about this place. Unfortunately it is  45 cents an ounce and the other place is 30 cents. Both have a nice variety of flavors but this place is missing the water cooler. You do get a bit sticky from eating your treat. There is something they have that yogurtland doesn't have. They have marshmallow and peanut butter in squeeze containers which is to die for!!~~#~0
Not a fan.  I was in the Biltmore yesterday shopping with my dog and decided to go and buy her a few treats.  As I picked out a bag of about 20 baked treats, my total came to be about $3.00.  I did not have any cash on me so I took out my "plastic money" the debt card and they wouldn't take it telling me that I needed to buy a few more things because they have a $5.00 minimum.  What store has a minimum nowadays???  The customer service was also very lack luster.  The dogs of the store employees were jumping on me which I found a bit annoying. Needless to say a store that I used to like, I will no longer be back.  There are so many other great dog stores...~~#~1
Wow.....  Not in a good wayThe sashimi was good because all they did was cut it, but that was it.everything else made me wish I went real Chinese! Not Chinese making sushi, culture theives!P.S. snow crab is not the main ingredient to every roll!~~#~1
With our regular Indian place converted to buffet and my lunch companions refusing to go (don't tell them, but I would go anyway), it was time to find a new Indian spot for the work lunch rotation.  We were on a mission and I was trying to figure out whether Jewel would be added to the list of acceptable lunch haunts.  After managing a circuitous route to the top floor of a parking garage, we navigated a maze like structure of corridors to find the restaurant.  Travel time was starting to negate Jewel from the list.  The lunch menu was small, and we all ordered the thali meat combination.    After a modest wait time the food arrived in an array of metal containers and was delicious.  I hope we go back, but majority rules.~~#~1
I used to love Banana Republic.  I stopped by at lunch to buy a few outfits, I wasted quite a bit of time in this store...to an frazzeling degree.  The choppy layout of the new store is annoying.  The clothing line changed drastically so you look like you just came from an overpriced (and cold) beach.  I was looking to dress sharp and professional, not wrinkled and hap-hazzard.  I wanted short sleeves, not flimsy spagetti straps, long sleeved blouses and SWEATERS (hello..its JUNE...and ARIZONA.)  Banana Republic's new format and collection is a huge FAIL.~~#~1
Kara is absolutely wonderful! She does a GREAT waxing and I am going to have her do a facial for me very soon. The atmosphere is very relaxing and Kara is an absolute doll of a person. I would highly recommend her!~~#~1
Never disappointed with this place!Get the brisket, get the pork. Get the beans. They're bangin'!!!!!! The sauce is delicious the mac and cheese is pretty good, the cheesy potatoes are good too. The real standouts I would have to say are the brisket and the beans. Do NOT skip the beans. Trust me. I'm not even a meat person but I do like Joe's because everything is cooked just right. Order extra of everything and you will be glad you did. Makes for great leftovers. Don't forget to get some BBQ sauce too. Personally, I'm not one to douse everything in BBQ sauce, just a little dip here and there, but the sauces are really good. Even my young niece and nephew enjoy the food. It's simple, down-home good food even the pickiest eaters can enjoy. I've never actually dined-in at this place. I've always called in an order for pick up or ordered right at the take-out window. They are pretty fast.My future father-in-law wants me to choose Joe's to cater our wedding rehearsal dinner. Did I really ever imagine in my wildest princess wedding dreams that I would choose BBQ for my rehearsal dinner? Not really, but Joe's is excellent, and we're heading toward a laid-back wedding theme anyway to take it easy on our many out-of-town family and friends. I am sure they will all love Joe's and I can't wait for them to try it!~~#~1
I think chef Silvana Esparza first located the restaurant here on CALLE DIECISEIS (she renamed the street all by herself, apparently) to take advantage of cheap rent.  There was no way she was going to locate her Scottsdalish restaurant actually in Scottsdale.  So, people from the wealthier areas - and some First Friday urban hipsters whose parents foot their bills - make the trek down to CALLE DIECISEIS to partake in everything Barrio Cafe.  And they think it's cool that they are going there, past the check cashing places, the people waiting at the bus stops and the "rawness" of this part of central Phoenix.And what is everything "Barrio Cafe"????Pretentious service.LOUD dining room.NO parking.Fusion food that is about 10 years past its prime.High prices.Let's talk a little about the last item on the list.Besides using vulgar language in her YouTube videos for pseudo social activism, Esparza seems to have forgotten her own humble upbringings.  It's ironic that the very people who live on and around CALLE DIECISEIS cannot afford to eat in her restaurant.  The Mexican immigrants and their sons and daughters who do the cooking, the cleaning, the landscaping and all that for Phoenix are not welcome at the Barrio Cafe.  I know that this is not a taco truck, but there is some overwhelming irony here that you locate your restaurant in a working class area and supposedly have sympathy for the plight of the downtrodden and the neighbors can't even eat  at your restaurant.  I guess that's capitalism.  Like that new car, by the way.~~#~1
Hospitality Suite Resort was my home away from home this last week and although they are not a posh spa type resort, they were filled with heart and gave me everything I needed in the seven nights I spent there.Why did I chose Hospitality Suite Resort?  I needed a place for seven nights (eight days) while I worked on my qualifying exams and worked on my dissertation in Phoenix.  I had two basic needs, a place that was cheap and had free internet.  That they had a daily breakfast was a plus, as was laundry facilities.  They had the best price for all these options, so I jumped.After a flight to Sky Harbor, getting a rental car, driving to Scottsdale, I had a hard time finding the hotel.  I finally asked another hotel on Scottsdale Ave. and she said, "OH yeah, the numbers are funny that way!"  Ha!  Very funny.  After that first time, I didn't have any trouble finding my way back to it again.  My morning commute to the Hokokum campus was very straightforward.  I was pretty much set.I was greeted by a fellow named J.J. who talked very fast (or maybe because of my travel and the time, I was processing very slowly).  He gave me a room on the third floor that was "overlooking the pool" (P.S. all rooms are "overlooking the pool").  He told the best place to park and showed me on the map where the elevator was.  It did take me awhile to find the elevator with my stuff in my hands, but eventually I did.  There were some British/French kiddos hanging out in the poor area, whooping it up and there was music coming from the lounge, but it didn't matter, I was so tired, I could have fallen asleep in a airplane (oh, wait, I did that too!).The next morning, I took in more of my surroundings.  My room had a lovely little kitchen with all the necessities and a nice large bathroom with a small stall shower.  The was a lovely full-sized ironing board and steam iron.  There was a coffee maker in the kitchen, along with a toaster, microwave, fridge (small) and hotplate.  There was a nice reading lamp over the bed and an easy-to-use clock radio.  There was a desk as well as a table and three chairs.  The king size bed was comfortable, but not overly so.  I certainly had no trouble sleeping while there, but I didn't have a trouble getting out of bed either.  Perfect.Breakfast was a choice of five breakfasts.  The menus were laminated, meaning the that choices did not change, but that was ok.  I chose two eggs, sausage, hash browns, whole wheat toast, oj and coffee every morning.  By the second day, I was greeted by name.  That was a nice touch, because I felt that I was very very far away from home.Instead of eating out every night, I went to Food City, just down the road and bought supplies to heat up in the micro. I bought sodas for the fridge and micro popcorn.  Ahhhhh... all the comforts of home.  Because I was up late working on my classwork, the partying didn't bother me.  The pool was a magnet for people, even at night, because it finally was cooling down.  I didn't go to any of the happy hours (friends don't let friend write on their dissertation drunk), but they sure looked like people were having fun!Doing laundry was a little complex due to my own non-reading of the map.  I made this huge circuitous route because I didn't know there was a laundry room in the part of the hotel I was staying.  Next time I will know!!All in all, I enjoyed my stay at Hospitality Suite Resort.  Next time I would bring less clothes because of the superb laundry facilities (you don't need to bring quarters because you buy tokens at the lobby).  Next time I would remember to bring a swim suit because those pools looked sooooo good!Yep, next time I would stay at Hospitality Suite Resort, it's got it all.~~#~1
I LOVE the pretzels! Wish they would bring back the Asiago Dip, but hey, garlic salt and cabs are 2 of my main food groups. Great atmosphere, can always see a game on one of the many TVs, even when my girlfriend thinks I'm paying attention to her! Milk stout is my favorite beer, but the light isn't bad either. Something tells me the others are good too, but it's hard to get me to stray from my patterns. Oh well, I'll leave someone else to review those. All in all, the food and beer is great, and the servers seem to know what they're doing too.~~#~1
I was very impressed with the service and food. St Francis provided a delicious meal and beautiful ambiance that was just right for a group of clients after work.~~#~1
I've now tried Thai Elephant three times.  My first two experiences were solidly mediocre -- nothing was awful, but aside from one delicious dessert (black sticky rice with pumpkin custard), nothing stood out, either.  As a recent Bay Area transplant, I admit to being a bit picky, but in my 6 months in Phoenix, I've found several places that more than satisfy my rather frequent Thai cravings (Swadee in Chandler, Thai Lahna in Arcadia, Sala Thai in North Phoenix, and, in a pinch, Thai Hut in Central Phoenix).  Until now, Thai Elephant hadn't really done it for me, but since the restaurant is literally 40 feet from my office and since other Yelpers seem to have had positive experiences, I was reluctant to give up on Thai Elephant without giving it another chance.On Friday, looking forward to a relaxing night at home, I called in an order for Pad Thai with chicken, Panang Curry with beef (extra spicy), and Spicy Eggplant with tofu (spicy, which I thought would be automatic given the name, but apparently wasn't).  I got home, meted out ridiculously oversized portions of the three entrees, and sat down to enjoy my feast.Wow.  I don't know quite where to begin, but to say that I was disappointed doesn't begin to cover it.  The Pad Thai was about on par with the Taste of Thai boxed dinners you can pick up at the grocery store, only less flavorful; marginal at best, but edible.  The chicken didn't stand out as being of particularly low quality, but the noodles were some of the worst I've had at a Thai restaurant (some bites were underdone to the point of being crunchy, while others were seriously soggy).Sadly, the sub-par Pad Thai was the high point of the meal by a wide margin.  The Spicy Eggplant was a bland stir fry of soggy, overcooked vegetables and limp tofu.  The tofu appeared to have been fried as a large block and then sliced, and a few small pieces of eggplant were thrown in for good measure.  The Panang Curry with beef was even worse.  Though I ordered the dish "spicy," the curry tasted like straight coconut milk with a few drops of red food coloring thrown in.  The beef was the last straw for me; it very may well have been the worst quality, most gristly meat I've had at any restaurant I've ever been to.  I tried several pieces, and all were similarly inedible.I really, really want to like Thai Elephant, but after the experience I had, I don't know if I can bring myself to give it another chance -- especially since I've found so many other good Thai restaurants in the Valley and since the second-worst Thai meal I've had since moving here was at Thai Elephant's sister restaurant, Thai Basil in Ahwatukee.~~#~1
I love Matts and feel everything about this place is IMPECCABLE. But unfortunately the small capacity seating and over an hour waiting in line ALWAYS turns me away.  Id be around more often if I wasn't wasting my weekends sitting on a hot bench.~~#~0
I found the food excellent, but keep in mind this isn't typically Mexican food this is Tex-Mex which is a whole different variety. Our waitress was fantastic, and talked me into getting the melted cheese on the side. It was quite tasty, indeed it has a bit of skin but generally if you cook cheese or milk included products into a liquid quickly it does get one..and personally I didn't haven't issue about it. The menu isn't extensive, it would be nice to have a bigger menu but with how accommodating the are, you could probably something off the wall and they'd be willing to do it.I ordered the bean and cheese burrito, which is delicious, and large. Its a fatty, and I loved it. When asked if they cook with lard the hostess had an immediate answer and listed what they used to cook everything with. I was so happy. Most have no idea, and aren't very polite if you ask. She was very friendly like everyone else we encountered there.I was told that the Steak was perfect, and mr.hard-to-please was filled up (had left overs) and stayed that way the rest of the night. Which was great. The salsa has an interesting flavor, and I must I dig it. I"m not a big fan of mexican rice so I didn't partake in eating it, however the fan of mexican rice at the table liked it, (but not as much as the fajitas) Conclusion - Excellent Staff, Great Food (Its Tex-Mex..not just Mex so bare that in mind. There is a difference!) Atmosphere reminds me of some place that would be placed in a Tarantino film. Price is average sit down if not a little high. Expect 2 people = over 30 dollars.~~#~1
RUDE RUDE RUDEI wanted to book a diner for my wife and I ( our anniversary.. The website i was on did not post the times of operation.  I left a message and today got a call back from a RUDE Owner.  He argues it is right there. He did not ask anything about where i was o tried to help . He called to argue  with me.  I can not believe i get a call at work and then when i tell the reason of the issue he argues with me and hangs up... childish behavior . I read the reviews on DEX and other sites and found that this is true across the board. Poor food prep and pretentious environment and owners... good bye Lon's  chief - ill never go to your location now.  And my 12,000 Sedona list will  be aware of your bad manners.  I am a native to Scottsdale and Lon's was a place that we went to almost 6 times a year. It was my mother's favorite place to eat. - until the food started going down hill. I believe it was these people who were at the helm at that time. I heard they were asked to leave.Hanging up on people.... this is incredible...   DO NOT GO HERE!!~~#~1
Eva's seems to be the place we go to every time we visit family in Casa Grande now.  It is a pretty consistent experience, and that's good enough for us when we're out of town.The food is pretty good.  Their sauces are on the spicy side, but that's ok with us.  They're still packed with flavor, and they compliment the meals.  The carne asada burrito (enchilada style) is a large portion.  Again, the sauce elevates it to being a little bit better than average tasting.  The  cheese enchiladas with their white jalapeño sauce were a little bit small, but very good.  The rice that the combinations get served with is just so-so.  Their chips are fine, the salsa is a little bit weak.  The food quality is average overall.The service has never been that good.  They're not particularly attentive or personable.  I felt like we were a little bit of a hassle at times.  The last waiter we had advised us to go with a combo plate because it would be cheaper, when it turns out, if you do the math yourself, it was about $3 more expensive.  The manager's solution was to take $1 off the bill, and then comp our sodas.  Hmm, ok.  A warning then to you all out there that are watching your cost.  Add your a la carte items up yourself and don't get pressured into the combo, especially if you don't want rice and/or beans anyway.The menu is also slightly confusing.  The prices are average.  The decor is nice.  The restaurant looks like it can serve large groups and parties very well.  Overall, Eva's seems to be a safe place to enjoy a meal, and we'll go there next time we head up that way.~~#~0
I love CK's. Their happy hour specials are great, service is awesome, and food is tasty. Try the adovada pizza...it's goooood.~~#~1
Had lunch at the Burger Studio yesterday. I always get nervous when there are not too many people in the restaurant at lunch or dinner. Usually a sign of some sorts. Ordered the Studio Burger and I thought onion rings (felt like I was down a quart of oil). What seemed like a long time to receive my food, I was unhappy to see fries instead of onion rings. Oh well. The hamburger extended over the bun which is always a good sign for a custom product. I was impressed with the bun as well, not a flat, stumpy bun but a high top with a nice sheen. It was delicious and the fries were good as well. Owner stopped in we greeted at which point I told him about the fries/onion rings and he immediatly comped me an order. They came out and looked very oily. Distictive beer batter flavor. Not that good....stick with the fries which are great. Overall....great tasting burger and fries and compared to the other guys (Zin, The Grind, Smash Burger) I put it right up there and a lot less expensive.~~#~0
Ohhh this is the best place ever! Every thing I have ordered has been delish!~~#~1
First time eating Cambodian food. I am not sure what it's supposed to taste like so it's hard to say if this is what cambodian food is....Small, quiet place. Entrance was non-initutive to us for some reason, we walked in the kitchen. It's the door on the left if anyone was curious. On a Monday at lunch, we were the only people in there around noon. I didn't know what to order but I like shrimp so I went for it. I went  for the Shrimp Ling rice combo. It comes with soup, rice and a pickled salad. The dish comes on a nice square plate so it makes the food 50x fancier just because it's on a square plate. Lots of shrimp in my plate ~ about 10ish and they're large. The shrimp was grilled and it tasted good but I wouldn't call it amazingly good that I was in love. I ate it and I like it but I thought to myself 'What is Cambodian food because the flavors don't seem unique? It seems like they grilled it in some soy sauce, maybe sugar, added more salt and maybe one or two other spices." FYI - There's bunch of green onions in the shrimp, I think they add that more flavor. They aren't chopped into small pieces, it's like the whole stem but I ate everything. I always eat everything - I don't waste my food (it's almost like a sin not to finish your food unless you take it home... so nevermind).The pickled salad was refreshing. I like the soup, it was lukewarm and it reminded me of a Chinese wintermelon homecooked soup. It's like a mixed of Chinese style chicken broth with Vietnamese beef broth without the saltiness and msg. Adding the green onions to the soup definitely makes it 50x better as well - WOOHOO. My dish was $8 - pretty good price. Thumbs up to that!Overall, would I go back? Eh - I don't know. I need to try other Cambodian places or maybe I should just have googled about it...maybe Vietnamese food is better? Apparently, the countries are located near each other so it's similar to Vietnamese food.~~#~0
My boyfriend and I stopped by to grab a bite to eat before work and long story short-Greeted immediately -Lots of variety-Meat lovers pizza is amazing-Ask for Tawnya she's really nice and a wonderful server -Will be back, loved the excellent service!!~~#~1
Not a bad place to go but not my first choice. The food is good but nothing unique or special.~~#~0
This has become one of my favorites.  They're friendly,  reasonably priced and the food is always delicious.  My husband and I have tried a number of their items, but my personal favorites are the BBQ pork appetizer, house fried rice, the mushu and lemon chicken.  My husband also loves the house fried rice, the mushu and the orange chicken.  One of the things that is so wonderful about this place is, the food isn't heavy.  The sauces are light and fresh tasting.  Plus, I'm lucky enough to be in their delivery zone.  When I get delivery, the food is still hot and tastes like it was made just a few minutes earlier.I have yet to be disappointed by anything I've ordered here, and to me, that's a sign of a good restaurant.~~#~1
You want good food? You'd be better off smuggling goat cheese in your boot and risking an anal cavity search for doing so than eating at this airport.You want scenery? Try desert.You want a comfortable seat to wait for your delayed flight?  Well you are in the desert so you'd probably better off finding a cactus and straddling it face first.You want a relatively close connection for your flight? Well tough shit.  Oh yeah, they've got people movers but somehow they have this magical ability to disengage people's legs.  Yeah I know it sounds crazy but as soon as people step on to these things their legs stop moving and they plant their fat ass right in the middle of the walk way.  Whats wrong with your legs you mammoth!?~~#~1
Yummmmm .... so authentic This is one of the few mom & pop's type of restaurant in N Scottsdale that taste oh so authentic and fantastic This is by far my favorite italian restaurant in town, way better than the big chain like Brios (don't get me wrong, they are not bad either)It is not a fancy place but very cozy. And it does make you feel like you walk into one of the ristorante in Italia .... the owners are 100% italiano and they only use the freshest ingredients ....  I had the best lasagna there, you can taste the texture of the noodle, the creamy-ness of the chess, the meat favor and the freshness of the tomatoes... totally awesome. Had tried the seafood linguine there too .... oh so good as well and with plenty of seafood ... definitely 2 thumbs up. During winter, make sure you make reservation ahead though .... this place seems to be snowbirds' favorite too~~#~1
What a beautiful hotel! The Clarendon is truly one of a kind. The staff goes above and beyond to make sure you have everything you need...and extras :) The pool area is gorgeous and the atmosphere is delightful. I had the opportunity to meet the owner, Ben Bethel. What an astonishing young man he is! I don't know which is more impressive, his efforts to make the hotel as "green" as possible or the fact that he helps guests with their bags as they walk through the door. I can't wait for another excuse to stay at the Clarendon again!~~#~1
Overall good place. Pizza was good and a great selection. The service however was really slow and non-attentive. Took 30 minutes after being seated to have wine and sodas at the table. Cute place, but the acoustics need some help, very noisy. Would go back if in the neighborhood.~~#~0
Overall , I like this place. A smal hole-in-the-wall place with straight forward, cheap, non-greasy Mexican food. I can dig it. I personally think the one on 7th st is better, but I will chock it up to growing pains since this location's only been open for about a week. I went today for my all time favorite Torta, but they didn't grill my bread so it wasn't nearly as awesome as it usually is...yes, I'm picky~~#~0
My friends kidnapped me for my birthday (yes, because they are wonderful), threw me in the back of my friend Jill's van and rushed me off (blindfolded of course) to Radio Milano.My friend Lindsay knew I had been dying to go there (I love Postino--same owner and across the street--so I just knew Radio Milano was going to be amazing).I've never met the man that owns these restaurants: La Grande Orange, Postino, Radio Milano etc (Lindsay apparently once did, lucky girl) but whoever he is, he is a business genius. The atmosphere of Radio Milano was sophisticated and classy without being uptight.  Everyone was extraordinarily nice and helpful.  True to form for this restaurateur's style, there is a large vase of (fresh every day) flowers that compliment the warm glow of the restaurant in general.Our server welcomed us with what were presented as "Italian Potato Chips" and a delicious dipping sauce.  The homemade ginger ale is so strong in taste, really good.I ordered the special for the night which was a vegetable lasagna.  It was soooooo good.  I'm glad I have such awesome friends to kidnap me and take me to great places.~~#~1
We had a fantastic experience here! We went on a Thursday evening and with the misters on, it was still very pleasant sitting outside, even in June. The wine list was extremely affordable - most between $25 and $60. For Scottsdale, this is a steal! We shared an appetizer and a main entree. The appetizer was delish. Grilled bread (perfectly grilled, not so hard that it hurts your gums) with three spreads - an amazing goat cheese and marscapone, eggplant, and hummus. Also, they serve house bread with a great sun dried tomato butter. For our entree, we shared the fish special, which was a sea bass with artichokes, fingerling potatoes, and spinach. Fantastic. The service was also great. I've come to expect any service in Scottsdale to be rude but  this place wasn't! Maybe we were lucky, but I enjoyed our experience.~~#~1
After a day full of meetings, I gathered the hubster and we headed out to eat some Mexican. I had visions of chips/salsa, and margaritas. We headed to On the Border on Stapley near Baseline but found that this location had closed. Egads. Then we remembered The Salty Senorita across the street. And thus begins the saga. "Hi, are you here for happy hour?". We said no but were seated in the bar area anyway. At least we got a booth. Lucky us, huh? Joe "lots of product in his hair" brought us menus and took our drink orders. He was pushing a certain type of Tequila and I took the bait, with the stipulation "on the rocks with salt". My drink, and hubster's water arrived and we ordered. The chips and salsa AND our dinners arrived at the same time. .Really Joe product??? Chips with the meal? FYI, chips and salsa here aren't complimentary, you have to order and pay for them. It was then we noticed ants had taken over our table. At first we thought it was just a couple but noooooooo. The hubster brought the ants to the attention of Joe product and he feigned concern but did not offer to sit us at another table. Now the hubster's getting annoyed. It's hard to enjoy yourself when you are swashing ants off the table. Our booth was by a window but we didn't see any influx from the window of ants, so we're not sure where they are coming from, but they don't stop. Hubster mentions it a second time, and then, again with feigned concern he offers to move us to a different table. By this time we are almost done eating and I just say let's finish and get the hell out of dodge. Our bill comes, we pay, and hubster asks for the manager. Hell, he's even younger than Joe Product and looks like he just woke up, thus we'll call him Bed Head. Bed Head offers to buy us a drink on the house? Really? That's your solution? He said he'd make sure other patrons aren't seated in this area. Egads, no thanks, we just wanted to leave. We weren't after free food, but the offer of 10% off or some kind of compensation for sharing our entire meal with ants would have been appreciated. A free drink? Hey,maybe one of those $60.00 margaritas would have made everything alright! As far as the food goes-I had the chicken antchiladas (get it, lol) with beans and rice and they were dry. I like my enchiladas with oodles of sauce and cheese, and these had very little sauce with a little design of sour cream on them. Hubster had a steak and avocado salad. He said it was ok. This is a never return place for us. And a note to Joe Product-chips and salsa should have arrived WITH the drinks, and before the meal.Reflecting back, we were there on Earth day so perhaps having ants share our meal was relevant.The margarita gets a 7 out of 10 limes as it was pretty good.~~#~1
I lived in AZ for a year whilst at JP Morgan. One of the few great experiences i had out there (back in LA now) was, going to their Good (yes, capital G) food places, they were really really, really Good...certainly on par with eateries I've experienced in London, NYC, Paris, et cetera.I finally found a neighborhood that had (gulp) personality: the Roosevelt district. I was so happy and comfy in my hundred-year-old guest house with hard wood floors, huge pre-air conditioning windows, a sizable green backyard, and an unobstructed view of the teenytiny Phoenix skyline. And just down the street from my extraordinary little residence was the absolutely amazing, wonderful and perfect Tammie Coe (the person AND the bakery) who had just opened their venerable doors.I was there every morning for their exquisite breads, cheeses, sweet things, perfect euro-standard coffee, lovely attendants....I miss it so much.It reminded me of Patisserie Valerie in London, or any good bakery in Paris...with a cool, fun and welcome American twist.I shall always go back to Tammie when ever I find myself in dreary Walmart-ized Phoenix. Tammie, you are an artist. My only hope is that you will consider opening a location in Los Angeles. Eat your heart out, Nancy Silverton!!!~~#~1
Mucho Taco falls closer to 2.5 stars-average.  The prices are very good and the staff was very friendly.Let me start with some positives:  the salsa was fresh and tasty as in these were whole tomatoes 5 minutes ago.  veggies on the tacos were also fresh and crisp.I had a fish taco & a carnitas taco-total about $4.50.  The fish was decent but the carnitas was pretty gristly.  I overheard the kitchen staff talking to a customer and found out that they make liberal use of the "L" word here.  That's right, old school cookin' for better or worse; Lard.~~#~0
I am a G-Spot addict!  Had to limit myself from going every week though.  Took the hubby there after a date night the other weekend.  It was his first time to try gelato.  He's a ColdStone guy 100% and he really enjoyed the Tiramisu gelato!  The focaccia flatbread is awesome!!!  And I would post a photo of the Focaccia Flatbread I got earlier to eat along with my homemade salad, but (in the words of LOLCat) "I eated it" and forgot to take a photo first.   :)My favorite salad dressing is the champagne vinegarette!  The mintchip gelato is freaking awesome!  The stracciatella gelato mixed with mint - even better!!!  G-Spot is so awesome, that I just walked back over and got my Mint / Stracciatella combo.  Baby C wanted something sweet!   :D~~#~1
Here is my honest assessment of Los Reyes de la Torta.  It's a three-star place.  The atmosphere is a bit dumpy.  My apologies to those who think reviews should focus strictly on food, but atmosphere is what I notice when I walk in the door.  Plus, despite the fact that the place was mostly, we were led to the table closest to the restrooms.  Seriously?  The star of the show here is obviously the tortas.  I tried the egg one, which had cheese and a very generous serving of sliced avocados.  This torta was delicious and a great value.  The other one I tried had chicken, onions, and some other stuff.  It reminded me of what they have at the Great Steak and Potato Company.  Not that that's a bad thing.  For the tortas I give 5 stars.  Other stuff:No alcohol.  'Nuff said.Greasy potato chips as a side?  That was kind of a bummer.  I was craving tortilla chips or fries or anything a little more exciting than potato chips right out of the bag.The flan was really dense and tasted like it was prepared forever ago in a huge vat.  Skip it.  You probably won't be hungry anyway after the tortas so don't get tempted by the pictures on the menu.~~#~0
I take the light-rail downtown sometimes just to go here. I walked in the first time to a bustling, energetic, singing, cheering crowd and thought, "where the H am I??" I felt like I had left Phoenix and ended up in a far away magical land of wonder and excitement. Food is decent for a bar, great beer, great local music (it's the first time I saw The Waters). Downtown Phoenix needs more places like this.~~#~1
Great food.  Good service.Salsa is the best.  Enchiladas are very good.  I don't know what they put in the sauce, but damn is it good!  No better Mexican food anywhere in Scottsdale.~~#~1
I went to Tommy V's for dinner last night with my husband and several of his clients...WOW!  This is my new favorite restaurant in town!  They have a private dining area that they can close off with curtains and turn the music off, which is perfect for a business dinner.  I am vegan, one of his clients is doing the paleo diet, and another is gluten free, and they had DELICIOUS options for all of us, while also serving AMAZING pasta and fish dishes to others at the table.  I can't recommend this restaurant enough.  I am just sorry I haven't discovered it earlier.  YUM! YUM! YUM!  P.S.  Very cool atmosphere, too!~~#~1
Update!Went back last night for dinner, this place is still awesome. I had the Las Vegas Rolls, they were pure deep fried goodness.~~#~1
I recently attended a conference in AZ and stayed at the Squaw Peak. The grounds were very nice, and with all the on-site activities this hotel would be quite a draw for the kids. Being I don't have any kids, plus it was too cold to be out by the pool, activities on site were pretty limited. The gym facilities and the comfort of the bed made up for the lack of adult festivities. The gym was good sized and had ample new equipment. The bed was really comfortable and had great pillows. Great for a family vacation, A-Ok for the business traveler.~~#~0
Really good pizza has to be among the most perfect foods in all the world.  Really good pizza would likely be on my last meal request list.  Specifically the roasted corn and goat cheese pizza at La Grande Orange Pizzeria which has to be near the top of the list for all the great pizzas the two us who contributed to this review have consumed.  And that is a lot of pizza.We were visiting Scottsdale as tourists when the concierge at the resort recommended this place to us.  Bless her.  Very convenient too to be able to shop for wine at La Grande Orange grocery, adjoining, and other goodies while we waited on our take out pizza order.  http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-grande-orange-grocery-phoenix#hrid:4cXbhzxxtmExF9kRjmFViQ/src:selfThe only hitch here is parking is terrible during peak hours. So it goes.  The pizza is worth the parking hassle.  We're on our way back to Scottsdale in a few days for another visit and La Grande Orange Pizzeria is on our "go" list again. The Rocket Man pizza is calling our name this time.~~#~1
Had lunch at Zinc for the first time recently right as they were opening.  Considering they were not yet busy, we had pretty mediocre service.  To begin with, we were not offered bread.  Since it was our first visit, I wouldn't have necessarily assumed we would get bread, but I noticed other tables had it, so naturally I felt slighted.  And then the cardinal sin of serving.  I was maybe 25% through my meal, when our server appeared with our check and asked if we would like dessert.  Well, I don't know.  I haven't really eaten yet.  My husband wasn't even finished, and he eats like he's still in the military.  Needless to say, I just took the check and short-changed her tip in return for short-changing the time I was apparently allotted for eating. As for the food.  I had the macaroni au gratin with smoked ham as well as their up sell of parmesan truffle fries.  I liked the mac and cheese.  Not the best I've had, but pretty good.  The fries were okay.  But I've never understood the concept of dressing up plain 'ole french fries and serving them with ketchup.  If I'm not going to get a nice aioli or some other special dipping sauce, I'd rather just have the fries sans all the other crap.I wouldn't necessarily object to a return visit if I'm in the area, but I won't be breaking down their door.  Just as well, I doubt they would care.~~#~0
Missed the happy hour but  the Margaritas were not expensive. Waited for an outside table but had to wait inside because you are not permitted to wait outside with a drink in hand. .( As an aside saw 2 arrests on Mill Ave after dinner becuse 2 guysgot caught drinking beer not so carefully disguised in brown bags.) Well worth it on a beautiful night.Great for people watching. Yes, cornbread is good but the nachos with 3 types of salsa was better. My entree was a chicken, mushroom artichoke stack. Decent but not fabulous. My wife's mushroom enchillada was better. .~~#~0
A very professional company that takes the time to deal with you on a personal level.  With great reassurance from Nate and his team they were able to handle the short sale of our home with very little stress and in a timely manner.They really helped when we thought no one could.  From beginning to end we were always kept informed and they got the job done.~~#~1
Holy frijoles- this place lived up to the hype. I'm surprised how how good the pizza is here in Arizona. Very tasty, and definitely some of the best pizza I've had in the valley. The only downside is that there is usually a long wait to be seated, and then once your seated, it takes a longer wait for your pizza. The prices are average, the service was so-so, but the food was excellent! Nice location too, right in Old Town so you can have a drink at a nearby bar while you wait for your table. Cool place for date-night, or to have dinner with family. It's fairly casual, but charming at the same time.~~#~1
::Sigh::I love places like this.  It is adorable and unique and intimate and perfect.  The outdoor patio looks like a great hang out spot (but obviously it is too hot for any of that just yet) and the interior is small and intimate.  I was surprised when I walked in as it was much smaller than I thought it would be- but who knows where I got the idea that it would be a gigantic place.  Our server was hilarious and fun- he happened to be from Ohio and informed me he was a Buckeye (I'm from Michigan, but I'm not a Wolverine so Buckeyes usually don't hate me) and was pretty cool about taking my fun jabs at his home state.  He was super attentive and even was nice enough to give me directions home (horrific sense of direction). I kind of wanted to be best friends with him.  Anyway... I had the one organic glass of red wine on the menu (he brought me a sample first) and the Pasena.  Both were great beverage choices.  I also got to nibble on the tomato/mozzarella and flaked tuna bruschetta and was pleased with both.  I'd go with the original.I dream of the day that I find such a cute little place on the West side (feel free to suggest one if I'm missing it).  The atmosphere rocks, and the unique booze options only add to the charm of this place.~~#~1
We've eaten here a few times, and the food was always good.  However, the last time we ate there, I found a BUG in my food.  When we complained to management, they still thought we should pay for 50% of the meal.  Never eating there again.~~#~1
I almost NEVER give a chain restaurant a 5-star review, not because I'm opposed to the idea but because very few are worthy. But Bandera is just that good, from the upscale casual, relaxed and inviting atmosphere to the excellent service to the delicious food.Ordering the cornbread to start is a must - it'd be a crime not to. The grilled artichoke and queso/guacamole apps are also wonderful. I had the macho salad, which was quite large and packed with good stuff. I also had a side of the mac and cheese that was outrageously good. Dessert offerings are limited to two choices, and neither blew me away, but the Oreo one was the better of the two.Bandera is, like its sister restaurant Houstons, always a wonderful experience with reliably terrific food.~~#~1
Tanzy, Yelp, and Lindsey deserve the biggest standing O for this event.  I honestly think I am still full from the generous food options that kept flowing.  I kept thinking we were done, but OH NO here comes another course.  I felt like I was at a chef tasting menu dinner.  Right when we got there we had a glass of Champagne and were seated with a olive and meat plate followed by some bruschetta and local made cheese.  After the event officially started we were hit with amazing course after amazing course.  With never empty glasses of wine  My Favs:Sweet Corn RisottoScallops (cooked to perfection with a parsnip puree mmmmmmmm)Alaskan King SalmonCenter Cut Filet MignonBrussel Sprouts yes Brussel Sprouts (Tempura battered with a sweet relish AMAZING)4 hour braised beef short rib (Talk about melt in your mouth)  Red Velvet Bread Pudding (I will go back just for this anytime I am near the Quarter)I can't wait to go back to Tanzy for a full meal but I don't know how I will be able to top this evening of amazing food.  I was very surprised to hear they have been open for 2 years as I was really blown away with their food and service.  Thanks again to everyone who helped put together this amazing event what a great way to end 2012.~~#~1
Funny story about my experience at this place. My Classmate mentioned she loves this place for other reasons than my own. Yet, when we drove up it was very crowded and parking is minimal when you don't arrive early. We drove in separate cars and I called and asked her, "are you sure there is no where else we can hang out? It is super crowded. Yet, I am so glad she convinced me to go in and check it out. I suppose you ought to experience it at least once for a night out with friends. There were many different cultures/ethnic backgrounds. I very much enjoyed the band. They played some old school R&B from Next, Bobby Brown, Prince, Cameo and that's just some of what they performed. Excellent Band! The crowd was very pleasant and fun! I had to join in with dancing and singing. My rating review is 3.5 stars. I would have to say that this venue is way too small for the amount of people it holds, the dance floor is super small, it's really dark and hard to move around even when you are dancing. The staff at Char's is friendly and I've heard the service is good. I didn't drink. So just word of mouth. I'm not sure if I would hang out there again. I would probably go only if I knew a friend/friends were here. That would still be a maybe. Although, I enjoyed the music, etc. I'm on the fence about Char's for some of the minuses that takes away from a place that could be so GREAT!~~#~0
I actually visited here about 5 months ago, but I liked it so much I figured I should give it a few good words! I was at the mall looking for something healthier than a pizza or burger and decided upon this place. It is part of their little slogan after all!I was not disappointed. I chose the beef kabob with a side of fries and pita bread with a cup of hummus. Everything was positively fresh and absolutely delicious. And the portions were big, too. I didn't think I would be filled up after the meal, but I was stuffed!The staff was very friendly and cooked everything in a timely manner. I was surprised they weren't getting nearly as much business as the other joints around the food court. They don't know what they're missing!~~#~1
i think this food is phenomenal. this was the first place i tried asian food in AZ when moving out here years ago. it has grown since then and the food is always top notch. for a late sunday afternoon lunch, the place was nearly empty but their takeout counter was constantly busy. our server was friendly and attentive and kept our water glass filled. it's been a while since i ate for the review for which i write so i don't remember exactly what it was, but it had the big, wide rice noodles which i love. i do remember that the dish was excellent and big enough to supply leftovers for lunch the next day. they ask how spicy and i've eaten thai food "spicy" and it is downright dangerous, so we opted for "medium" with a side of spice juice...which was HOT!we will continue to patronize Tottie's as they are consistent and the food and service has always been very, very, very good. and very reasonable prices.~~#~1
I have been by this spot many times and I needed a place to eat lunch so I stopped in... I entered the restaurant and was seated right away. But then I sat there for a good 10 minutes and watched the workers walk around  then I got to see the owners little kid decide she was going to sit with the consumers in the booth a head of me... Then the kid started crying and it just does not need to happen I was kind of shocked please leave your kids at home if they are not working at the restaurant.  I ended up getting up and asking the staff if I could just get the lunch buffet. I got a bit of everything to try I enjoyed the rice and the chicken dishes... The fish dishes on the other hand not so good the fish puffs were cold and not good and the one fish dish super fishy tasteing. The bread was really good that came with the meal... So all in all I would say I will not be going back anytime soon nothing to write home about.~~#~0
This place is beautiful, great patio with classic decor.  Went to Happy hour...of course and had a few glasses of wine and  yummy calamari.  Service was off the charts!  We were sitting on the patio...a little hot and Schwetty...and the server kept moving the umbrellas to shade up as the sun set...WOW!~~#~1
I am not usually a fan of botanical gardens. They seem too precious, too "perfect" to be of much interest. And, let's face it, flowers and plants are beautiful things, but when you pay to look at them in neat rows, something is lost.That said, Desert Botanical Gardens is an exception to this garden cynic. Many of these cacti look like they are from another planet, like something you would see in a sci-fi film and say, "wow, it's too bad those crazy plants don't exist." They sprawl out on the ground, weaving and turning every which way, or compose huge bizarre formations high off the ground. I never knew such bizarre life forms existed, or that some cacti look like trees.The gardens are full of windy paths where one is also likely to find a family of quail, lizards, or a jackrabbit or two. Various species of bird can be seen here as well, especially at dusk. I especially love watching the birds fly in and out of nests they've made in the upper arms of cacti.This place never grows old. It's a great introduction to the desert for people from out of town, and because the cacti have been collected from around the world, a cool botany lesson for us all here.~~#~1
Great place.  Hard to see behind Carl's Jr. on Southern Ave but is Worth finding!~~#~1
So sad to say, I have to change my rating from 5 stars to 1.  I had been a faithful customer of Katie's for years, at least 3 or 4!  She told me she wasn't going to be doing nails anymore because she had developed carpal tunnel.  I was heartbroken.  But she told me she was training the others in her shop to be able to do nails like her so I figured I would continue to go there.  Next appt I needed, I called and scheduled and said it doesn't matter with who because Katie isn't doing nails anymore, right?  I was then told that Katie is still doing nails but she was full that day.  Very hurtful!  I always tipped her VERY well and was always willing to work with her schedule.  But needless to say, I don't go there anymore, haven't been there since I ended up cancelling that appt and going elsewhere.~~#~1
I saw the reviews of this Arribas and thought to myself, "Are these people talking about the same Arribas I went to last night?" I went there, and had an awesome time! Service was prompt, and if something was off, our server Jeff (who was amazing) explained why something happened, but didn't blame anyone, and didn't use server jargon. I do understand the jargon, but it was nice for someone to not have to resort to it. Warm chips and salsas + warm bean dip came out = awesome and the spicy salsa was calling my name. It burned, but I loved it. I ordered the Rio Grande enchiladas with the carne abodoba, and ordered it extra spicy. (Of course, I would) I was with my girl (and she likes strawberry margaritas) so we split the house margarita for 2, frozen with sugar of course. I'm not a huge margarita person, but it was really good. She ordered the cheese enchiladas. (She takes safe choices when we go eat) -more on the margaritas in a min- Food come out and seriously, it was some of the best spanish/mexican I've had in a while. Its good to see an establishment take risks with seasoning their food. It was fresh! Which is hard to find these days and I'm pretty sure the people who own Arribas own a hatch chile farm because I rarely saw anything about jalapenos or serranos or even habaneros. Which is cool. Those hatch chiles are slanged around that place like coke in studio 54 in the 70's. I'm not kidding, when you order your entree and they ask you what kind of beans you want. Black, pinto, or the 3rd kind that is a combo of black/pinto with some onion, tomatoes, and of course, what's that? Hatch chiles! I highly recommend them. I liked how Arribas uses the hatch chiles. It sets them apart. It brought the heat!After dinner, I ordered another margarita...This time, I asked Jeff of a recommendation. Why do I do this? Because the people that work at any restaurant know the food/drinks there more than you will ever know. 'Nuff said. He brought out some margarita I don't even know the name. It kicked my ass, thank god my girl was driving home, that's all I'm going to say. Thanks!That's why this place gets 5 stars. It deserves it in my opinion.I think because this place takes chances with seasoning and overall outlook is why so many people might be unhappy with Arribas or this location in general. I on the other hand PROMOTE this thought process. I don't want food that's bland that a place kicks off the line to the people outside than enjoy bland food. That makes for a BLAND place that's filled with, well, bland people. This place uses heat, salt, pepper, and other spices that I don't know of. What a freaking great idea! Too hot for you? Then don't eat food that is 99% based on heat.I will surely be going back, and I won't have a bad time.~~#~1
The cool name of the place is the only good thing here. The burgers are below-average and unenjoyably (is that a word?) messy. Fries, too greasy. Seating, not comfortable. Skip it!~~#~1
Good food, if all the Taiwanese comes here that means this is really good.~~#~1
This Mexican restaurant has the best burritos in town!  This is not your roach infested 24 hour drive through kind of burrito joint either.  Here are the reasons that make La Tolteca #1 and one of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix!1-Full bakery with mouth watering fresh pastries2-Fresh ingredients and great prices3-Also serves beer if you feel like having a Corona with your meal as opposed to take out4-Little market has the best prices in town on citrus fruits and just enough of everything to cook up a little Mexican meal (Ranch Market not needed!)5-Make your own pico/ salsa bar, make it your style and get as much of it as you want:)So, if you are downtown looking for authentic Mexican this is the place.  Of course it is super casual take out or seat yourself kind of place so don't  try to flatter your date here! But get there early, I'm pretty sure they close up shop by 9 or 10...~~#~1
Good sandwich! Better than all the chains, doesn't beat Jason's deli, would like black tea (not green). Fresh tasting and clean~~#~0
I went to sears today to check on a layaway that I placed online but was going to pickup here. Margaret, the associate couldn't find me in her system so she personally called the sears.com help line to find out what was happening. She was friendly, professional, and extremely helpful in solving my problem. I went home a happy customer and am very thankful to Margaret for her help!~~#~1
This place has really bad service and the food is barely decent, I would advise not to dine here. There are much better Vietnamese restaurants in Phoenix.~~#~1
Shoes, and purses, and make-up - o my!Your sales totally RAWK guys!  I mean, seriously - 50-70% off (gotta catch it just right, people) and then, an extra 30% off that?!  I feel like a wild thing, you make my heart sing.OK, now today, the most I found was 40% off - B U T - then there's MAC!  Oooooooo, ya baby.  All that glitters is NOT gold.  (ok, it's the small things...)It was still fun to look at all the purses.... And mark some for future reference.  Hey, I am a patient person.... I stop for red - tags, that is.~~#~1
Great food, great prices, and great service.  I am a big eater and could not even finish all my food for only 8 dollars.   The orange chicken was fresh and tender with excellent flavor.  The combo also came with fried wantons and spring rolls.  Super far from my house, but worth the drive.~~#~1
Yes, before you ask, I still love Desert Stages Theatre, perhaps more than ever.  This is Andrew's fifth play there and this time he plays the Knave in Alice in Wonderland.Normally, we don't ask for a specific role but the director of Annie Jr. thought he would be cute as the Dormouse as he popped up from the table so that's what we asked for this time during audition.And we anxiously waited for the casting to be posted.  When the casting was posted, he did not get the requested part and as a mom and a parent, I was glad.Why you may ask?  Because to me as a mom and a parent, it's very important to teach my son the importance of handling success with graciousness and moving through disappointments with a positive attitude.  When he asked why he didn't get the part, I told him in simple words that the director had a vision of what the whole play should be like and she saw Andrew in the role of Knave and that was his special role.  I also told him that it doesn't matter what role you get, if you play it with all you got and go out there and perform with your heart as there are no small parts, you will capture the audience's attention and that will be your moment.He listened with a typical 5 year old attitude and became very excited about being the Knave.  And I was also excited for him because this time around, he had 2 long lines to memorize and speak!With each review, I've written about how Andrew has grown through DST and here I've included a video where you can see him growing aware of theatre and performance:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsG07sMlZ5s&feature=related.  This time around, he started asking me if he was a main character, starting to understand the structure of a performance.  It was great to see his awareness growing.  I highly recommend bringing your own child to audition for a play here.  It will be an amazing experience!!Really, DST is about the kids.  Trusting the kids to do their part and giving them responsibilities.  Once the curtain lifts, the kids are responsible for THEIR performance and for each other.  It's fantastic to see the kids have their moments on stage, being responsible for moving and arranging the set, take care of the tech, go from loose energy backstage to fanstatic actors on stage.  It's all fabulous.If you have doubts of what kids can do, go to a show at Desert Stages Theatre and be amazed.  Truly, if you believe in your kids, as DST shows again and again, your kids will shine and raise above your expectations!~~#~1
The fitness part of this place is great: machines are new and plentiful.  Good classes on the schedule, and plenty of cold water and fresh towels.Now, the spa, on the other hand, is mediocre at best.  The pool is a bit of a walk and available to anyone at the hotel; same with the jacuzzi, which also means the jacuzzi is outside!  Why no jacuzzi inside?  The steam room is small and there is no sauna.  There are only 3 shower stalls, with shampoo and shower gel, but no conditioner. The lounge area is also small and not at all relaxing.  And the robes are super thin (with a chilly room; that's not even nice!) and not very big.  I had to sit very carefully so as to not expose myself to everyone. Hello! haha.The massage itself was very nice, but the spa is not relaxing, especially for the prices.  I wouldn't return to the spa, although the gym is good.~~#~0
For a boba drink fan like me, it is still rare to find a tea place that has authentic tea (and not just milk powder), hot or cold tea choices, and boba and tea that taste great individually or separately.I ordered an iced chocolate chai (yum! such a difference from plain old Oregon Chai used at most coffee houses) with boba.  The only negative is that the drink was $4.91, but it was well worth it!  Mmmmmmm love this place!~~#~1
My friend took me for a birthday lunch.  John our waiter was very helpful and had perfect timing.  We shared the Stetson Chopped Salad and Fillet on Toast with leeks and homemade potato chips with blue cheese.  The kitchen plate/split our fillet, always a plus.  The salad with salmon, chicken is offered, was tossed tableside.  CC always has it's own twist on offerings.   The bread pudding and banana icecream were decadent.   Wish I lived closer.~~#~1
well dang gummit....git on over here and by me some camo flawj....tha kind that has little dangly moss on it....and while yur at it, i need me a gun....too bad i already have a gun and camo. i use to be a big hunter....deer, dove, turkey, squirrel, ducks etc. it's what you do in south georgia when your fridge is empty and you're hungry. this bass pro shops is ENORMOUS!!!!! i love it. although i don't hunt anymore, my brother and father do, so every year i get gift cards for them from Bass Pro Shops. the gear and guns are more expensive than other places, but their selection is incredible. when my dad comes out here, i can't wait to take him here to see all the taxidermy and fish tanks...i know he'll love it. the staff is usually friendly. the firearms dept is a bit intimidating and the guys at the counter can be smart asses. but this place is just really neat overall. it is also a family retreat, so don't be surprised to see hundreds of kids running wild while their parents let them be terrors.~~#~1
I've been taking mine and my family's cars to Cathedral for more than a decade. We are always treated fairly, and always have a good experience - the guys always stand by their work and "go the extra mile" to be sure our cars are fixed properly. They work on both our new(er) cars and my cars from the 50s and 60s. Whenever anyone is looking for a mechanic, I will send them here without fail - and John and the guys at Cathedral have always come through by totally taking care of anyone I send to them. In a business filled with some sketchy practices, I know that whether I send my wife, a friend, or a coworker to Cathedral they will be treated honestly and fairly. Cars break and break down, that's a fact of owning one. I'm glad I have Cathedral to make dealing with it so easy and stress free so I can get back on the road as quickly and cheaply as possible.~~#~1
Great happy hour specials.  All the appetizers are delicious!  Service is first rate and it's nice to sit outside on the patio.  Great people watching without being too obnoxious!  LOL~~#~1
This review pertains to carnitas, and as such should not be taken as a suggestion for ordering any of the following: fish tacos, rice, beans, horchata. That's about it! Yum!~~#~1
I love that this Safeway is right across the street from my work. I like to walk here for a bit of exercise to get lunch. The deli is awesome. They have a sandwich bar that has these really great gourmet ingredients they will make a sandwich for you. For 5.49 it's not too bad and if you use your Safeway card you buy 7 get the 8th sandwich free. They also have premade salads and a hot bar as well. Very friendly, Alan who has made my sandwiches the last couple weeks is very friendly and does a good job. Bonus points the Starbucks is right next to it!~~#~1
Imagine a white silk wedding dress.... black! Well, that may be a bit dramatic but it was pretty bad. More than 1.5 years after my wedding I took my dress in to Bell. They kept my dress for a couple weeks, called me when it was ready and I was so excited to see it almost new. They did a fantastic job and were careful not to over treat the lace and silk with chemicals. They made me feel like they really cared. The business is family owned and the man at the front is so nice to work with. And, the pricing was extremely fair. I paid $89 which was much more reasonable than other places I checked. I highly recommend Bell Cleaners.~~#~1
I think people have a tendency to overrate this place because it is the only restaurant of its kind.  Don't get me wrong, the pasties are great, but there are a few reasons why this place isn't a four star restaurant:1) It's overpriced.  You're paying almost 15 bucks for a lunch originally meant for miners.2) It's cramped.  Good luck going there with more than one other person.3) It's a little dingy.  Someone said the atmosphere is great.... Huh?  Not sure why a dark dining room that is six feet wide and crowded can be considered a nice atmosphere, unless maybe you grew up in a sewer.Also, make sure you get there early if you want a table or food in a reasonable amount of time.~~#~0
Pretty good, not remarkable in any particular way.  Last minute decision to pop up to the bar for dinner last night.   Love that they have Dos Equis Amber on draft (most places only have lager).  Chips & guac were a little diappointing....  tasted like the bottom of a bag of store-bought chips... but the guac itself not too shabby.   Salsas were unique and I did enjoy their flavor.  Had the carne asada plate which comes with rice, beans, and a really delicious authentic thin tortilla.  The beef had good seasoning and flavor, but a little dry and chewy.  Fish tacos were fine, but again nothing remarkable.  Dark atmosphere, nice bartenders.  Good pinots by the glass.~~#~0
Enjoyed dinner on the patio - I had the Pad Cha Seafood dish rated "Thai hot" - the so-called hottest dish on the menu.  The person I was with ordered the ginger fish - mediocre at best, although it looked great with a variety of vegetables and pineapple.  I felt the dishes looked better than they actually tasted.  The seafood (mussels, calamari, salmon, shrimp) in my dish was very fresh but it wasn't Thai hot at all.  The ambiance of their patio was enjoyable and the Thai iced tea was very tasty although a little too sweet towards the end.  Overall, I will probably give this restaurant another try in the future but I wasn't very impressed with the taste of the food.~~#~0
I love to eat here, however it is hit or miss. Sometimes we get good service and other times we don't. Sometimes the food is really good, but other times it's off. Our order is usually messed up, but they are good about fixing it. One thing I have a problem with is using coupons here, I had a coupon for a pizza and also ordered an appetizer at happy hour half off. They did not want to combine the two offers but the coupon didn't say say anything about that. When the food is good though it's really good, which is why we return.~~#~0
I came in here to order to get takeout it was 19.99 For 2 cheese pizza's ummm not so cheap. They only use 1 type of cheese the pizza was not great I wouldnt go that route again but I am willing to go back and try the Veggie pizza. I surprised my brother with some suicide wing's I dont eat meat but I did try the sauce and ate some w my pizza it was HOT. He loved them all 20 were gone at the end of the night. They said they were SO HOT but the boys just couldnt stop eating them. They said they were very good meaty and not too vinegary. An extra star for making the boys happy with the hella hot wings that night. FYI they probably use hydrogenated oils here by the way but I didnt ask!~~#~0
It seems like dine-in theaters are popping up all over the Valley these days. Studio Movie Grill in north Scottsdale recently opened.The theater has a far less luxurious feel than the AMC Esplanade 14 or even iPic Theaters. Instead of comfy reclining seats, you're stuck sitting upright, and you won't get any blankets to keep you warm. The inside looks the most like a traditional theater that I've seen at a dine-in theater-and my companion mentioned the lobby reminded him of an airport, and the theater itself, a bowling alley.Like the other two places, though, ordering food or drinks from your server is as easy as pushing the button at your seat. They'll come and grab your order (the menu is full of American food, similar to AMC Esplanade 14), and they'll deliver it to you throughout the movie.Movie tickets are $9 Sunday-Thursday and $11 Friday's and Saturday's, which is way less expensive than iPic and around the same price at Esplanade. I heard people are arriving up to an hour early for weekend movies, so be warned.We drank and ate during the movie. We got a pitcher of domestic beer for $15, which I thought was a good deal considering the two of us drank two beers each from it. For food, I ate a grilled cheese sandwich ($6.25), which came with French fries. I actually really liked this grilled cheese sandwich, since the bread was thick and there was lots of cheese, and the seasoned fries were thickly cut and tasted great. Some regular movie theater concession stand items at non-dine-in theaters are just as expensive, so I thought the food prices here were really reasonable.Though the food and prices were satisfactory, based on the less comfortable atmosphere, I'd still pick AMC Esplanade 14 out of the now three dine-in theaters I've tried.~~#~0
It's kinda comfy setting....For the Non-(official), Yelp event, they had penne pasta...but Sonoma's specialty is rotisserie chicken......Nice but I sure would have liked to taste what the place raves about---Chicken!  Oh well, the pasta was ok for what it was.  What I truly enjoyed about Sonoma was the layout.  You can easily entertain a fairly large crowd and not be on top of each other.  I need to come back and try their chicken then re-write this review.The parking upstairs for the event was nice also, but later on at night, it seems a bit spooky to be walking up in the parking area alone and in the middle of city center where there are some pretty curious characters about~~~I would prefer coming with more than one person if parking at night in the upper garage (personal preference).The Yelp folks!---Way too cool!  I am so glad to have discovered Yelp!  Best thing I've done in ages.---Cheers Yelpers!~~#~0
Let me start by saying the crawfish ettouffee was the best I've had in a long time! The food itself should probably get 4 stars, however, our service was just plain bad, so I'm just going with 3 stars.The outside patio area was really nice and they had live music and a bar outside.~~#~0
My husband and I ate here for lunch as we were waiting for our room to be ready (we were checking in early).  The restaurant is very inviting and I liked the decor.  We had a great window seat the overlooked the outdoor terrace and the mountains in the background was lovely!    The hostess was very friends and our waiter was attentive and fairly personable.  I ordered the Beet & Goat Cheese salad with Grilled Chicken and it was quite good!  Even though I liked it very much, I would only give it a 3 out of 5 because they didn't use Roasted Beets...I believe that they were canned beets.   Still good, but roasted beets would have knocked it out of the park!  The salad had spinach, mild goat cheese, mandarin oranges, red onion, and delicious candied pecans....with a balsamic vinaigrette.  It was a very good salad.  I wished I had ordered the small serving though because it was a large salad!  The My Husband ordered the Grilled Chicken Sandwich with fries.  The fries were SO good!  The sandwich was equally good, but spicy from the roasted pablano that was on it.Net-net....it was a very good lunch, but I can only give it 3 stars because it cost us $40 for a salad, a sandwich, a soda (I had water),and gratuity.  For $40.00 for lunch, it should have been outstanding, not just very good.  I get that it's in a resort, but still.~~#~0
What started as a food truck back in the 80s, has now evolved to two successful restaurants in the valley.  Using traditional recipes passed down through generations in Mexico - LT delivers the flavors that reminisce of street tacos in Mexico.  Using ingredients made from scratch, the marinades used for the various meats are outstanding!Being first timers there, the service staff was very friendly and suggested what menu items we should try - to experience the best they had to offer.  Our number one dish was the #1 (about $6 or $7) - an assortment of three street tacos with chicken, pork, and beef.  All of them had unique and bold flavors - you could taste that the marinade had really absorbed into the meats.  They were served with cotija, pico, and cilantro - adding that truly authentic flavor to the tacos.  We also sampled the fish tacos and burritos.  Why this wonderful little place does not receive four stars or more?  Despite what Guy Fieri said, despite the wonderful flavor of these tacos, everything we ate was lukewarm or less.  From the refried beans to the rice, to the taco meat, and burrito.  It gave us the sense that despite being made from scratch, these wonderful ingredients had been sitting there for a while.  Albeit the flavor and texture of the meats was grand, it did not taste fresh.~~#~0
Tried Rock Bottom tonight before a movie and I thought it was ok.I had the Lemon Grilled Chicken with Mashed Potatoes and Asparagus.  Everything was very yumm, but Rock Bottom just didn't make enough of an impression on me. If I was obsessed with beer maybe it would have gone over better. Restaurant ambiance and menu were very typical and neither were impressive. However my crazy friend Megan ordered Buffalo Fajitas, yes real buffalo steak, so that was a cool menu option. Now I can add Buffalo to the list of crazy things Ann Marie has eaten.p.s Buffalo tastes a lot like steak.~~#~0
Great location, super cool conversion of an old gas station. My only gripe would be that barista didnt rinse portafilter before pulling my espresso shots , thus my cappuccino tasted burnt. This is however a common problem at most indy coffee places.~~#~0
As the prior reviewer states I too drove by this place a million times. My husband and I love breakfast and are always seeking the ultimate omelet . We both ordered (of course) an omelet. Mine was chorizo, cheese and green chilies and my husband's was cheese and mushroom. I must say the food was piping hot, which is always a plus for me, I like my food hot! The omelet was pretty darn good, and the hashbrowns were nice and crisp. Not my ultimate omelet but I would definitely go again.~~#~0
I like Yogurtland, however, the lines can get long and my yogurt melts by the time I get to the cash register. It's also difficult to fill your cup with yogurt because it is pure chaos in there! Customers are running around everywhere and can't make up their mind. I also hate how I don't know how much yogurt I am getting...it ends up costing more than I bargained for and more calories. Their topping are cut into huge pieces (probably to weigh more) and the topping bar is usually messy. Again, I will stick with other yogurt places.~~#~0
Priceline had this resort as 4 star but it looks and  feels like 3.The employees are nice, though. WiFi 13$/24hrs.Grounds are nice.~~#~0
Used to live in this neighborhood, and it was a favorite.  The place is clean and modern, I love the look of the bar.  The servers are very good, and friendly.  Used to go with a group of friends for "taco tuesday" almost every week.  They have now taken this off the menu, but will still do it for you if you ask, which is cool.  (two fish/steak/or chicken tacos and a margarita or beer for $10).So why only the three stars?  The last two times I have been there, food has not been good at all.  Had the ahi tuna sandwich which was always my favorite.  It's served rare with this wasabi mayo and so so good.  However, second to last trip there, ordered it and the tuna was not good quality.  It was stringy and didn't smell right.  Took two bites and that was it.  Because I'd had so many good experiences gave it another try, convinced myself it was a one time bad piece of tuna and ordered it again.  Big mistake.  Stringy and inedible again.  Probably won't be going back.  And if I do, I have learned my lesson about the tuna.~~#~0
I have never been into soul food per se, but my husband woke up craving some chicken and waffles, and well, you can guess where we ended up. We were so pumped that there was Kool Aid on the menu, so we ordered that immediately. I don't know why every restaurant doesn't do this... Kool Aid is amazing. The service was decent - our waitress was quite friendly, and the food came out quick. I got biscuits and gravy, which was pretty delish. The gravy was thick and filling. So filling, in fact, that I couldn't finish them. I also got a side of mac and cheese which was not great, and I didn't eat a lot of it. Overall, I'd give this place a solid 3. I'd come back again, but mostly because my husband thought it was some kind of wonderful.~~#~0
I've eaten here last year and this is the second year. I finally am able to compare steaks to another location. I love the decoration as it's sports of all kinds. There's always something new you haven't seen before. It's the perfect place to eat and study what is around you.I had the crusted Parmesan cheese steak. I had tomato bisque and the string onions. Those are good! I had the steak and it felt like it was missing something. I'm not sure what as I don't eat steak a lot. The soup was great. It was a cup and perfect. The onion strings were good. The steak was ok. I'll always go back, but not for steak. I also wish their menu was more broad with more items to choose from.~~#~0
Let me first say that this is a nice place. The Chips and Salsa were some of the best I have ever had. My Wife and I both ordered Soft Shell ground beef tacos. The ingredients were great and everything tasted very good. However I would like to note that the tacos were swimming in grease. Overall It was one of the better places we ate in the phoenix area.~~#~0
I met some friends last night at Cadillac Ranch and this was my first time going. The space has a very odd layout, but there are two bars (one inside and one outside on the patio) and both have plenty of TVs to watch. There is also a very cliche mechanical bull, but unfortunately (or maybe fortunately) no one rode it while I was there.Service at the bar was really good, but when our group moved to a table, service became spotty. We had two servers for our table of 11 and one would take a drink order or would be asked for something and then not deliver it or something would get missed...the two servers just didn't coordinate very well. Luckily we weren't in a hurry and were a pretty laid back group. I only ate the Cadillac salad (mixed greens, tomatoes, cheese and croutons) and it was a nice size for $7.95. However, and maybe this is just a pet peeve of mine, but I hate when restaurants put the dressing on for you! I prefer for it to come on the side, as it does in almost every single restaurant I have ever been to, so I can put on as much as I would like. I did try a few of my friend's fries and they were good...not oily and for fries, they were actually pretty light. As a note, for groups, they put an automatic 20% gratuity on the bill, not the standard 18% most other places do.Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place as a lunch or dinner destination as I was not impressed by the menu or the entree prices which seemed on the high side for what they were. However the three stars I am giving Cadillac Ranch are for their happy hour:$2 domestics$3 imports$3 Fat Tire bottles$3 Flavored Smirnoff Vodka drinks$3 Margaritas$4 Rum (Captain Morgan)$5 Vodka Martinis$3.50 to $5ish select appetizers (there are about four or five)I'm always happy when I can get Stella drafts for cheap. Also, according to the bartender, one of the margaritas they serve can only be purchased a maximum of 4 times by one person because it is so strong. One piece of advice: If you start at the bar and move to a table, close your tab at the bar even if they offer to transfer it to your table. We had a huge mess last night and some people overpaid and some of us underpaid.~~#~0
Yard House seems to be a good place to meet a group of people because of their huge menu, beer selection, and atmosphere conducive to talking... this location can get crowded, so depending on when you go, be prepared to wait.I'm typically not so much into chain restaurants but I've been to Yard House more than a handful of times and it's pretty consistent so I don't mind going every once in a while... the thing is, I now have a favorite item on the menu, it's the miso glazed sea bass.  When we went the other night, they were out... bummer!Our server was fine- not the most friendly, but took decent care of us.  We were a party of 6, and I wasn't the only one planning on ordering the seabass... my aunt and I were both disappointed, but what can you do?  I ended up with the shrimp and vegetable terriyaki bowl and my aunt went with the tuna tartar appetizer and edamame.  Others at the table had the scallops, the turkey burger, a steak salad, and scallop entree... Few of us were drinking that night, but we managed to have a good meal.The manager, Clem, came over to apologize for being out of seabass - that was appropriate; obviously, we knew it wasn't his fault, but the gesture was nice.  In thinking about writing this review, I have to say that I lingered between 3 and 4 stars... I ended up giving just 3 because the Yard House has become just another chain restaurant in my eyes... nothing special, the same thing every time, just plain old average!Sure, I'll be back for group meals, but I won't be rushing over on my own or on a date anytime soon. Go for a beer, go to watch a game, go to listen to some classic rock and have an average meal... and if you like seabass and it's in stock, go for it!~~#~0
Hello my fellow Arizonians.....My review gets 3 stars but I really should give it 2... I am being generous.I will start....as always, by saying I am the pickiest person I know and although food is a preference.... I know what I like! We went on a Saturday around noon and it was packed!  There were several larger tables open but nothing to accomodate 2 people so being the outgoing person I am, I invited a couple people to join us so we could take a larger table.What a great way to meet people, and they were great tablemates!The food is good, I only have a couple CONS....No low sodium soy sauce and most of the food is VERY salty!The selection is not great, no calamari or bbq pork and several other items I enjoy.The only dim sum restaurant I have experienced out here is C FU Gourmet,,, their selection is greater but their downfall is the food is usually cool to warm and the place has been steadily getting worse. (bummer) and the owner just doesnt seem to care.If you enjoy Dim Sum...I reccomend you give it a shot and see what you think.And until then.............Bon Appetite'~~#~0
What can you say about Beni's - Not bad and not great.I have been to Benihana in several different cities and for a chain teppan restaurant it's ok.  My fave was in San Diego, could have been the company we were with.  I would definately say they are pretty consistant everytime we have been.  The teppan is a little pricey, the sushi is consistantly good (they also offer the all you can eat sushi), and the sake selection is ok (very average).  I do get tired of hearing the birthday song 10 to 15 times while we are dining.~~#~0
Ok, so this is a Sprouts now. Boring.The layout of the store is pretty much the same as when it was Sunflower. I would like this Sprouts more, if it was like an actual Sprouts. Instead it's just a weird transitiony in between "Sproutsflower". That's what I'm calling it, until they figure it out. Atleast they still have the soup bar.~~#~0
A no frills hole in the wall hamburger joint.  The burger is cooked to order, delicious, and the perfect mix of juicy and slightly greasy so you know you're eating the real deal.  The fixin' bar is an interesting concept which I like since I can pile on as many goodies as I like.  The bar gets a little messy at times, but eh, who cares.The burgers are not the cheapest, but then again if you wanted cheap you'd go to a dollar menu, no?  Its worth the line, and fighting some of the students from across the street (Phoenix College) for a bite at Hamburger Works!~~#~0
Had breakfast here on a Saturday morning in July.  I ordered the Spanish Scramble.  It was good.  I don't have much to say.  It's close to home but it's just okay.  Still looking for my go-to breakfast joint.~~#~0
Drunk people go here. Service is good depending who you get. The Burger according to one Arik B can not taste his burger. When ask the server, how come my friend Arik b can't taste his burger? Why?You had to be there to laugh. What a fun night!!!!Don't order the pancakes, they are not very good. The chicken strips were a-ok.~~#~0
Staying here in lieu of getting a real apartment.  Pros:There is someone making my bed.Location.Eye candy (they got something right).  Girls are smokin. Valet.  Cons:I have a rental car but for nights out, where are the taxis?  You would think paying $250/night 5 nights a week, you would think they'd call one for me.  When I called front desk, they told I can catch one downstairs.  No, I do not want to stand out front in the cold and wait fot the parking attendant to holla one for me.  Very small rooms - No couch or real sitting area.And what?!  No tubs except for the suites. No jacuzzi?Gym - is that treadmill falling apart?  No, it's just someone using it.Bliss lotion (smells great but useless) - all this dry weather, I have to BYOL.  Room service (food and wine by the glass)...more variety please.~~#~0
The food at Beaver Choice Scandinavian Bistro is delicious; a little unusual, but easily understood. Hearty and reasonably priced. You can find out all about it at azcentral.com in an article by Howard Seftel. Then, after reading this survival guide, you should go and try it.     Things you will need: 1. An afternoon or evening with no commitments other than your meal. This could take a long, long time. 2. A pen and a piece of paper on which to write your order (along with an alternate choice). 3. Dining companions who all enjoy the same foods and are willing to eat off the same plate. 4. A snack to tide you over until your food arrives. 5. A sense of humor (but try not to laugh out loud),     Here's our experience:     Four of us entered the small, 20 seat restaurant at 12:10. There were six other people seated at the minimalist glass top tables. A large, and very appetizing looking catering order was taking up another table. We were given menus and told to order at the counter. There were many, many choices of entrees (a few warned that they would take between 20 and 35 minutes to prepare - we avoided those), and each one came with a choice of four side dishes. You can see why a paper and pen might come in handy. Ken went to place our order, but he had to wait for three other people who had arrived before him. It took a while.  Then he was told that my entree choice was not available because they had run out of gravlax. I came up with another selection, and Ken went back to the counter - where another group of people had taken his place and were ordering. Another wait, then my second choice wasn't available either. The sauce had to be reduced and wouldn't be ready until Tuesday. I figured I'd be safe with a third choice of Swedish meatballs, so I yelled over to Ken who saw that each of our orders was being written on a separate piece of paper. Odd.     We settled in to wait for our food. Our drinks were brought to the table. Sena's eyes popped when she sipped the pitch black coffee. The waitress said it was always that strong and that there was no milk or half and half available, but she could bring out some heavy cream. I noticed that food was coming out of the kitchen painfully slowly. One dish to one table, a while later, one dish to a different table. Companions were left twiddling their thumbs. It so reminded me of Hell's Kitchen - I could hear Gordon Ramsey going ballistic: "Shut it down you &*#$%!!!!" . At about 1 PM my Swedish Meatballs were delivered. I put the plate in the middle of the table and invited everybody to dig in. Luckily the servings are large. We finished that off and waited another ten minutes before Sena's chicken schnitzel arrived. That too was shared. At about 1:35 Ken's entree was brought. That left Leon, who had ordered Tilapia. We flagged down the owner and told her that we had a 2 PM engagement and would like our remaining dish. She said she'd look into it, went into the kitchen and was not seen again. A while later another staff member came over and told us that there had been a large catering order, that they had only a six burner stove  and that 2 employees had called in sick. I mentioned that I didn't think it was right to serve some people at a table and not others. "This is the way we do it, we're not going to change it, and Howard Seftel thought it was all right", was the emphatic reply. More waiting. At 1:50 a different staff member came over and said it would be a few more minutes. To our disconcerted rumblings he said - and you're not going to believe this - "The fish has to be defrosted slowly because of the parasites...."  At this point, I'll confess, I started to laugh loudly and somewhathysterically. It may have been rude, but I couldn't help myself.      We were out of time, so Leon decided he'd take the fish to go. Ken went up to the counter and gave one of my Valley Vittles cards to the "parasite" staff member, saying that the food was great but the service terrible. At which point the staff member had a melt-down, yelled at Ken to get out of his restaurant, then went slamming through the kitchen kicking something on the way out.      This was truly one of the oddest dining experiences I've ever had. Very Alice in Wonderland. But if you go equipped with the five items mentioned above, you'll have some excellent food.~~#~0
I've been to Orange Table a few times and adore the venue, grocery and store. However, I have been less than impressed with the food. The first time I went for breakfast and had the Jersey Girl Omelet. It was good but not great. The next timeI had the mushroom pizza. It was so greasy that I had to go through multiple napkins and could only eat 1-2 small pieces before I gave it all to my friends.To sum it up, if you are looking for a chill place to hang out, people watch and do some small gift shopping it is a great place but don't do there for the food.~~#~0
This bar is now "Dodey's". Sold just under a year ago. *See "Dodey's reviews.~~#~0
Food was decent.  Overpriced for what you get.  Had 2 Distrito margaritas, $10 each.  You'd think for $20 you'd catch a little buzz.  Not sure any alcohol was in them.  I may go back if someone else offers and pays.  Otherwise, no desire.~~#~0
My wife and I had lunch here. Not too hungry, so we shared 2 Spring Rolls ($3.75) and one dish, My Nam (4F, $7.50), Good thing we weren't hungry, as the dish size was smaller than we expected, but did have 7 shrimps. Spring Rolls were essentially tasteless, as was its peanut sauce. Dish was OK, and the broth (not meant to be a full soup) was excellent. 3rd star earned by an exceptional level of cleanliness. All in all, if you want Vietnamese, there are many others, but this is very convenient. Many more better choices~~#~0
Good barbecue, but not great. I ordered the BBQ Sampler and shared with my wife.  With an extra side and a delicious chocolate chip cookie for dessert, it was plenty of food.  Unfortunately, the quality of the food wasn't as high as I was expecting based off of all the Yelp reviews. All of the meats were very tender... The brisket and pulled pork especially.  But they were devoid of significant taste and had to be drowned in BBQ sauce in order to taste anything.  Thankfully the sauce was excellent and readily available.  Of all the meats I sampled, the winner here was the ribs.  Definitely not the meatiest, but extremely tender. I could pull the bones right out and devour.  Delicious!Outside of the food, everything was excellent.  I arrived at peak time on a Saturday night, and the line moved quickly.  It snaked through the restaurant and out the door, around the corner, but it moved quickly.  We waited no longer than 30 - 40 minutes.  All of the servers were extremely nice and helpful.  There was plenty of seating available, especially outside.  It was a lovey place to enjoy a meal.  It is unfortunate that the quality of the BBQ does not rise above "medium" to match the high quality of the rest of Joe's Real BBQ.~~#~0
This is my favorite Pei Wei. It is always clean and never too crowded. They also have a fantastic covered patio. I like the Mongolian beef or chicken and the Dan Dan noodles and my husband likes pretty much everything he tries here. They used to have a beef ramen bowl that was to die for but I guess it was only offered for a limited time. The food can be salty at times but I always enjoy it.~~#~0
I've been here for a couple of happy hours.I agree with Charles R - no need to pay full price (especially as the regular prices are a bit hight) and it is better than Ra.Definitely not the best sushi I've had in town, but the drinks are good (cucumber mojito!) and the place is set up well for happy hour groups.The servers I have encountered are all VERY patient with people coming and going within the group and individual checks for everyone.  Knowing what a pain that is, I really appreciate how willingly they do it.For good sushi, I will stick with Yasu or Sakana.  For happy hour, this is a great place - and the Tempe Marketplace location is convenient to several friends.~~#~0
Dear Arizona Cardinals, Can you please get your crap together and win some games (similar to last night) so Phoenicians will like you and you can finally build a fan base?  While I half-enjoyed watching you spank the St. Louis Rams yesterday in the last game of the season, while scoring the most points in a Cardinals game since the 1970s, you still suffer from mediocrity.  Your win against the lowly Rams was hardly inspiring since that team completely sucks. AND FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, can you please beat the piece-of-crap 49ers?!?!You remind me of a nouveau riche socialite with no manners.  You have a beautiful expensive abode, but still seem like you're from the wrong side of the tracks.  Please tell your owners to stop being so cheap, beef up your roster, spend a little dough and take some risks and the ever-elusive glory years might be around the corner.Last night, a jaded and cynical fan of yours told my friends (in Rams jerseys) in the parking lot, "Thanks for sucking today.  WE usually suck and all, but your team was much worse."Funny and defeatist attitude, but what do you expect?  I'll be here waiting, cheering and hoping.  There's always next season. Five stars for trying.One star for the crappy ownership.~~#~0
i don't understand the hype. it's very typical american chinese food. tried the bourbon chicken and it was nothing special - tasted very teriyaki.~~#~0
Not bad, but definitely not my first choice. If I were to eat pizza in the restaurant, then this is a good choice. But there are better choices for take-home pizza.~~#~0
I really try to like Old Town Scottsdale - and if you look past all the God-Awful tourist traps it is actually quite a nice place with a number of top notch dining options - but in the end you can only walk by so many mass-produced "native" jewelry shops with "Bargains" before it all starts blending together.  Parking is generally a travesty but can be found if you're willing to wait it out and the public art is a nice touch.  For my dollar - go, grab a spot, and kill some time at Cartel, grab some local foods at Bodega, and maybe consider a bite at one of the locally owned restaurants like FnB or Praying Monk, and skip any place with turquoise jewelry in the window while focusing on the galleries that don't quite seem to fit the 'theme.'~~#~0
Lucky Strike strikes the wrong chord with me.  I've been here to this location four times.  I have been to another location out of state on a couple occasions, as well.Since my first visit, the bartending staff has improved LEAGUES.  The women working at the bar last Friday night were actually personable and friendly.  That is saying something, as in the past the people working at the bar were... to put it nicely... AWFUL PEOPLE.  It's a great CONCEPT, but it just doesn't impress me.  The food is hit or miss, but it is usually miss.  Some food that comes out of their kitchen is just awful.  They don't ever seem to have drink specials... at least when I've gone.  The bowling is pretty expensive compared to Brunswick Zone and... honestly... I prefer Brunswick.  If it was up to me, I would avoid Lucky Strike altogether.  Sure, it has a nice downtown location.  Still, there are so many better places to spend my hard earned money downtown.~~#~0
I prefer this location of Sephora over the Scottsdale location. The Chandler location is less busy and more spacious than the Scotts location. When I first started going to this location I thought it was great because the staff was way more helpful and willing to give out samples. I am now finding the staff to be a bit annoying. They are great, but everytime I look at something they come over and ask a lot of questions or try and steer me to buy a particular product. It gets a little annoying to have the Bare Escentuals Smokey Eyes pointed out at least three times every time I'm in the store. All and all I love Sephora no matter what location! It's heaven on earth for most of us gals. Yes the products are pricey, but they are quality products you can't get at the drugstore.Hmmm, this review must sound confusing. Here I am saying I prefer this location, but then complain about how overly eager the employees are. This location isn't as snooty as the Scottsdale location and the employees are friendlier.~~#~0
Moved here from San Francisco, and have been searching  for decent Chinese food.  Flo's has been our standby, but we tried Jade Palace on recommendations of our midwestern snowbird friends. I can only comment on the food, as we ordered take out.  Our order was ready in 15 minutes and it was complete.   I had Chow Fun, and it was the equivalent to Flo's, Ok, but not spectacular, and a lot more oily.  Husband had Mongolian Beef and said that Flo's was better, but the meat tasted fresher on the Jade Palace version.  Jade Palace is much closer to us, so I will try their Hot and Sour soup in the fall, which is usually the barometer I use to measure Chinese Food.  Go figure, we are now hoping for some San Francisco restaurants to relocate to Scottsdale.~~#~0
We made the trek down from northern phoenix to get some authentic ramen.  I wanted to love this place and I wanted it to be worth the trip, but it just wasn't.  The decor is as previously described - you sort of time warp back to the 80's but it is clean and well loved by its owner.  They do have a lot of authentic menu items and a great kids meal, but the ramen was just not that good.  Its downfall was the broth.  Hubby got the salmon chirashi which was also not that fresh.  If I'm in the area, I may give it another try for the don-buris.~~#~0
Pretty nice for an airport bar. Just had a bloody mary, but the food looked good.~~#~0
Despite the nice layout, design, and store variety of the City Center, I was still heartily disappointed. Some friends and I were merely trying to find a parking spot to do some shopping and things of the sort when we were notified that it was going to cost us a hefty $30 to park in a MALL parking lot. Outrageous. Turns out the WWE was in town and I guess they wanted to get some extra cash out of the mullet sporting, dentally challenged fans of Wrestlemania. Cool I guess, but not for us that were just trying to buy some swag. They offered some sort of validation system to reclaim some of the $30 coughed up, but it all seemed more than shifty in nature so we decided to park elsewhere. Everything else about this nice outdoor shopping center is exceptional. So waddya say Westgate? Create a better system for those of us not there for the events at the stadium across the way?~~#~0
Oh Chelsea's your a tricky little spot, you have tasty tuna tacos (by far the best fish taco I've had in phoenix) but that little tuna delight cost 18$ which is no big thang except that I work within walking distance of the place and 18$ for a lunch taco dish is straight baller status. The outside patio is great and the service is what it is, Its a good corporate lunch spot but stay away when it comes to dinner, its kinda boring, OH YEAH IF YOU DRIVE BY THIS PLACE THEY PUT SOME CRAZY TASTY SMELLS IN THE AIR SO BE STRONG AND KEEP DRIVING YOUR WALLET WILL THANK YOU.~~#~0
Hula's seems pretty hyped.I had drinks here that were OK.I had food here that was OK.I'll try it again and get an entree, but I'll not likely go out of my way to make it here.~~#~0
Gallo Blanco Cafe has amazing food, however the service needs a lot of help.  My first visit was one of the worst customer service nightmares I've ever had dining out.  My second visit was much better, however I think our waiter must have been high on drugs.  During my second visit my friend and I ordered the fried manchego cheese appetizer and it arrived after our main entree.  Really???  I wish this place would get it's act together.  I'm very fearful in recommending Gallo to my friends and clients.  I've vowed to give Gallo one more shot and if it's not at least a good experience, I won't be back.  I work too hard for my money to throw it away in an establishment I don't believe in.~~#~0
Meh... I am surprised to read all the reviews about the clean store everyone else wrote about. In my experience, the toppings area looked like it had all merged to become one big nest. There were also speckles and swipes of fro-yo in all places imaginable... floor, counters, scale... And, I wanted to try a couple flavors, but there was no one around to help. Also, the checkout lady was soooooo dreary! With her monotone listlessness, she made me feel as depressed as Sylvia Plath! (just kidding, but she couldn't have been more doldrums if she tried)I usually go to Yogurtology at Town & Country mall (on Camelback just east of the 51). That place is always amazing... Pristine clean, neat, organized, always a peppy guy by the machines with little sampler cups, a guy who had one too many Red Bulls and is nearly throwing at least one sample of every single flavor at every single person who walks in the door, with a funny, witty little quip and a great personality and WAY too damn much energy. But it's nice.THAT is what I had in mind when I discovered THIS place. I was excited. It was so much nearer to my house... great location (stupid layout though, prone to human traffic jams).I really, really want to like Yogurtland, but I just can't talk myself into it. The fro-yo was good (aside from the fact that I had trouble getting toppings without being too grossed out since it was a mess), but that was about it. All in all, they're lucky I felt generous today and gave them 3 stars, because I really had to talk myself out of giving them only 2.-Jessica~~#~0
Meh.  Met up with a few friends here and sat on the patio on a Saturday night around 8.  There are no heaters, which would be ok if it was a nice fall day or a summer night, but i was a bit cold towards the end.  There is indoor seating as well so this shouldn't be a deal breaker.  I ordered a few nice glasses of red, one pinot noir and one petite syrah.  I ordered the tuna salad and the bf ordered the grilled cheese.  It was just ok, and so was the service.  Our plates sat on the table for over 20 minutes after we were finished before they were cleared. Cute place, good music, not a huge variety on the menu, just salads and sandwiches.  I would likely go to humble pie next door next time while in the area which is how we spotted The Main Ingredient in the first place!~~#~0
Great bread and sandwiches. Nimrod employees.~~#~0
If only they have more fresh produce I'd stop by a lot more often!~~#~0
Drive through or dine in. The drive-thru wait for your order can seem overlong. I'm a fan of their carne asada burritos and their chicken burritos - very tasty. Also their breakfast burritos. They use real tortillas, not gummy doughy ones like fast food joints use. All the burritos are huge - really two meals worth of food. But, they're not careful about removing gristle from the meat or excess liquid from the spoon before wrapping up your burrito. So if you're a picky eater or you don't like messy food, don't get any kind of burrito. Burgers and Philly cheese steak sandwiches are also pretty good. They have a big variety on the menu actually. It's a greasy spoon, and I do mean greasy, but was a weekly stop when I worked nearby.~~#~0
Similar to Desert Ridge.  All the typical chains are here. I like the Jimmy John's for a quick lunch.~~#~0
For opening night, there was a giant wave of people coming through the door.  The bar was dimmed in red and purple lights.  The bright new white dining tables were ready to be eaten on.  All new upscale posh furniture in the bar, dining area, and patio.  We were not able to get dinner but we'll be back.~~#~0
Food was good but I can't say I was terribly impressed overall.  The food kind of took a ridiculously long time even when only one other table was in the restaurant.  The appetizers came out fifteen minutes after our main meals - we had figured they forgot about it.Tastewise, things were decent but not quite memorable.  I had a chicken shawarma and the whole ordeal was filling but a bit on the bland side.~~#~0
Harkins 16 is exactly like every other Harkins theater.  That it to say, a huge, context-less concrete box in the middle of the desert that shows the same movies as their competitors.  I saw the Simpsons movie here tonight and just have a few thoughts to share.-The Cine Capri screen is big.  Anyone who has visited either the Scottsdale location or now-defunct Camelback relic knows this, but I felt it was worth repeating.  Very cool to see a movie on a screen larger than life itself.-There is always "that guy" in the theater.  You know, the one that laughs as loud as a bullhorn, repeats everything that happens on-screen, and occasionally yells out something profane or derogatory.  Now, imagine a theater where every guy is "that guy."  If it weren't for the cool factor of the huge screen and seeing a movie I've been waiting to see since childhood, I would have walked out in annoyance.  Seriously, what compels people to behave like this?  I don't know if this is due to the proximity to ASU (beefneck central), but it sucked.-Previously mentioned by another reviewer, but Dippin Dots are awesome.  Simply awesome.Getting out of the parking lot was a disaster.  I don't know if the whole Tempe Marketplace complex could be more poorly designed.~~#~0
Okay, so Kevin and I initially wanted to go to Samauri Sams next door, but they closed at 5 (seriously??), so we checked out Yelp reviews for this place and decided to give it a go. The atmosphere was... interesting. Very loud mural on the wall of a cartoon pig cooking meat, with innuendos littered all over the place (see photos other reviewers have left). It is a very clean establishment, and the staff was super welcoming and friendly. I am not a huge fan of barbecue, but my pulled pork sandwich was amazing, as well as the warm cornbread I got on the side. Kevin got something similar with some spicy sausage or something. I didn't care for his, mostly because I don't like spicy things, but he enjoyed it. I think the food and the staff is worth between 4 and 5 stars, but OMG the music. Nothing but really lame jazz and 90's soul music. Each song was progressively worse than the last, and I kid you not - Brian McKnight came on and I just about lost it. The music did not match the atmosphere and killed the vibe for us, although we had a few giggles and fully enjoyed being there anyway. Would I go again? Yes. Would I most likely strangle the person in charge of music next time? You can count on it.~~#~0

Growing up in Tempe, I've been to the Rooste a few times. Overall, the experience is good but nothing to write home about.One of my recent visits was on New Year's Eve. I made a reservation ahead of time and the process was perfect. They said upon arrival, if there is a wait for tables we will be bumped to the top of the list. When we arrived, the hosting staff said it was going to be a 30 minute wait. I was a little confused but no point in causing a fuss because we didn't have a strict time schedule for the evening. We walked over to the outside patio to check on the view. Within 5 minutes our buzzer went off and we were seated. Our server was fantastic and friendly. The food was delicious with LARGE portions. And surprisingly not as expensive as i thought it would be.My next visit was about a week ago on a Saturday night. We forgot to make a reservation so when we arrived we found out it was going to be an hour wait. We waited maybe 30 minutes before we were seated. Our server, however, was not as wonderful as our visit before. It took 20 minutes to get waters and she kept blaming the bus boys for everything. The food this time was OK. My dad's prime rib came out cold, like it was straight from the fridge. All the side dishes were cold or overcooked. It was a less than stellar experience this time around. If I hadn't been here before, I certainly would not return.If you want to give it a shot, I'd say go for it but don't expect the best meal you've ever had. The view and atmosphere is what makes the restaurant.~~#~0
Pretty ok place, right in the thick of it, I saw 3 separate arrests while drinking beer on the patio.  They have a couple different 4 Peaks Brews.  Those facts alone made it a successful endeavor.  Did I mention it was 4pm on a Friday?~~#~0
I am a HUGE fan of micro breweries. Gordon Biersch is cool... a little "chain-like", but the ambiance is great.  I felt like I was under dressed.I had the seafood cobb, which was awesome. They use REAL crab here... thank god.Hubs had a large burger... he loved it and loved the garlic fries. I had the Hefeweizen and hubs had a couple Schwarzbiers. Not bad at all.~~#~0
The features in the room seem outdated.  The room was a sauna when I got in and could not fix the problem because the thermostat was hard to figure out.  I woke up in the middle of the night because it was unbearable and a staff person did come by and was able to make the room a little cooler.I like the check-in and check-out kiosks so I don't have to wait on a line for a live person who seemed to be just chatting away with someone.~~#~0
Reminds me of the 24 hour on Camelback - similar layout. I've noticed all 24 hour employees remind me of jocks.... well at least in Arizona.Anywho, I think they need fans in the cycle room - no wonder it's so warm in there.Like all the 24 hours I've been in Arizona, it's just so warm. At least this one doesn't have a chloride or funky smell in the beginning. Employees are receptive when you have questions/inquiries.~~#~0
Moira isn't the best sushi I've ever had, but for Phoenix and my neighborhood and the pricepoint (as long as we don't order alcoholic beverages) is doable when we get a sushi craving. The happy hour is a great benefit if you can get away from work before it ends.  Their spicy rolls are definitely spicy, and have some great kick to them.It hits the spot without breaking the bank and we'll take it.~~#~0
Sucker Punch Sally's is a nice place to grab breakfast on Mill.  The prices are alright and their hashbrowns are made the way I likes 'em.  Usually people serve up this mash of whatever-the-fuck but here, they grate the potatoes and serve them crispy.  The way I likes 'em.I'm sort of burnt out on places with a 50's motif, but whatever.  I like the colors.  It's kind of cozy.One thing that bothers me:  The name "Sucker Punch Sally's" sounds like something disgusting you'd head about in high school.  You never heard of a sucker punch sally?  It's when a girl....Nah, but as a whole, it's a cool alternative to have in Tempe.  Read my review on Harlow's.  I like Harlow's, but I always get diarrhea.  IHOP is full of olds and I don't particularly enjoy pancakes.  They hit the bottom of my gut with the gravitational force of Jupiter.  Now we've got Sucker Punch and it's pretty chill.~~#~0
Enjoy coming here with a group, cooking our own grub and playing in the sand. Evenings in April and May are great, as are September and October. Winters are a bit chilly after sunset, and the summer... well I don't need to explain that one. No great deals on food or drinks. Service is hit or miss but I come for the company and don't really mind. Order a few pitchers and your grub to cook, then pretend you're at home having a BBQ. No service required!~~#~0
3 and a half stars. I finally had my first ever Valley Oregano's experience tonight. You'd think I'd have gone to the one on Camelback ages ago, because, well, I live minutes away from it, but no, it was the Tempe location which sucked me in. Ok, not necessarily sucked me in. I drove my ass all the way out there to meet some friends for dinner, but still. Wait was an hour which kind of bit. We were tempted to just go to Thai Basil instead but as I never had Oregano's we persisted and stayed put. Once seated, we ordered things that I won't be eating anything close to resembling for the rest of the week: the spinach salad (ok, maybe I'd eat that), the cheesy bread, a large thin crust pesto pizza, and the pizokie for dessert. I'm a huge deep dish fan (I know, I know, thin crust is how real Italian pizza is) so I'm going to reserve major potential star wattage for when I actually have one of those. I thought the pesto thin crust was pretty decent - didn't blow me out of the water but it was good. The salad was flavorful and the cheesy bread was decent, but the pizokie dessert thing was awesome. Maybe it's because I I haven't had one of these since BJ's back in college (which is a longtime ago), but it was pretty damn delicious. Scene was pretty much college-y, loud, and full of "like, I was all"s, but duh, what else is it going to be.All in all, almost all stuff not good for me but whatever. Now that I've finally had my Oregano's experience I can go on with my life. Nothing like a local pizza chain holding you back.~~#~0
Went there tonight before the game.  The best thing about the whole bar is their t-shirts.  (I really wanted the t-shirt that read "You look like I could use a drink")Anyway....I had the nachos...bad choice....smothered in cheese sauce and melted cheese, beans, cheese, peppers, cheese, tomatoes, and oh yeah...cheese.  It was a soggy mess.  (And it was huge...the nice server should have been thoughtful enough to warn me that it could feed a table of 6)... my friend had the pulled pork sandwich and the probably the best onion rings that I ever had. (Yes I stole a few)I have to give it minus another star for the HORRIBLE music that they play...seriously...if I am going to see a game, I don't think house and dance music is the way to go. But too each his own.But I did had to cut the time short during the game because I started to get sick....hmmmm...soggy nachos perhaps?~~#~0
Great place for dine-in and pick-up!Ambience: Contemporary/ CasualFood/Drink: American.  Good salads and desserts!~~#~0
I've been to Silver Spoon once, I need to go back to really make the decision if I like it or not.  I went in the summer, it was kinda hot in there-- like most places in the summer but, the heat makes me grumpy.  SO I need to go back when the weather is normal.I got a salad-- it was massive, a little too much dressing for my liking.  Okay, A LOT of too much dressing but I ate it anyway. I'll probably try something else next time.  The staff was nice, the snarky guy that someone mentioned was snarky, buy snarky in a fun loving way, at least that is how I took it.  Snarky can come off all wrong and bad if not done correctly or if you just aren't in the mood for it, or if you yourself is snarky too-- then it's a disaster.  It's close by my work so the fact that I have not returned makes me keep it at a 3 star review.~~#~0
The sandwiches are truly AWESOME.  The Bobby is fab.  I went to the Chandler Rd location for years and now go to the Tempe location.But, I give 3 stars because I've yet to have "good" service.  Something always seems to happen.  I call in my order, it gets lost.  I call in my order, I'm told they are too busy to take phone orders.  I go down and order in person, my order gets lost again.  I'm convinced I'm cursed.  I'll keep going back because that Bobby is the BOMB but service is what it is.~~#~0
When I walked in we were greeted instantly. The place smelled a bit like a hole in the wall but nevermind that. We were happy to come in to happy hour. Galbi for $11.95. Whoop! Thankfully we were the only people there because there was only one server. I ordered the galbi and parents ordered the bulgogi. They also ordered a mango and mocha boba. Ten minutes in more people trickled in. and then this is where the service started to get slow. We got our appetizer no problem. Then side dishes. Ten minutes later the entrees were ready. However, it took him 5 minutes to get our rice. Another waitress showed up and we thought things would go smoother. We asked for our bobas and her response was "he's by himself and working on it".  I didn't like this response considering we had already been there 20 minutes without any drinks we ordered. Overall we enjoyed the food but just not impressed with speed and service.~~#~0
3.5 stars! I must say, I'm a total fan of their Zipps Golden Wings! Gotta love their reverse happy hour! Ordering their wings on medium is smart move, their wings are already so flavorful and sweet, that its a shame to go any hotter, since you'll mask the inherent, crisp, and juicy flavor. I'd say pass on the Fish Tacos, and if you're in a burger move, order the Jalapeno Burger. Sampled their beer, not bad! Breakdown:Zipps Golden Wings ~ a MUST get!Fish Tacos ~ Yawn...Sweet Potato Chips ~ Could do again!Jalapeno Burger ~ Delish! Overall, this is a chill spot with your better than average bar food!~~#~0
I've been here a number of times and the food is always good.  They have a fantastic selection of cheese and it's a great place to try boutique cheeses.  The current rating is due to the service we received last night.  The hostess was very friendly but our waitress was sorely lacking.  After our food arrived and two in our party still needed silverware, we informed her and she never returned with silverware.  We ended up stealing it from a neighboring table.  She made a bleak attempt at humor telling us that one of the cheeses was a water-based calorie-free cheese when we're pretty sure it's a triple cream.  If she'd had an iota of personality, the joke might have flown.  But, it fell flat and left us confused wondering if we'd really just ordered calorie free cheese.  We enjoyed our evening anyway.  The service could just use a little work.~~#~0
"America's friendliest airport"? Really?I disagree. I didn't particularly notice anyone being overly nice or particularly friendly to anyone else here. What I did notice is that they have the same selection of mediocre, overpriced "we have a captive audience so we're going to offer them crap and charge an arm and a leg for it" bars and restaurants.I hate to be provincial, but come by PDX some time and check out the local restaurants and bars and see how it's done. Plus a star for free wifi! Woot! Every airport should have free wifi! (I'm looking at you, SFO!)~~#~0
Monday Morning - take outRoom for improvement - - same curt, terse service- too cramped to actually look around and appreciate their items for sale- food was average, but not worth all the fuss this place requires.+ I like the food for the most part and you can't go too wrong with a red velvet cupcake...can you?This place is all fuss and hippity dippity so i surmise that is the situation with the crowds.    I am sure I will be dragged there again by another friend in that neigborhood so I will try to look with new eyes.:)~~#~0
The pizza is just OK. Pretty crowded at lunch time and seating is a nightmare. Get the lunch special, you get a personal pizza slicer and a pan. Would get it to go if I didn't live in the west valley. Good idea to have a separate take out door but don't count on this place to be acceptable for those of us with disabilities to get around.~~#~0
I am a BIG fan of chicken and waffles and I will try it just about anywhere it is served.  I especially love it in the morning; when everyone else is ordering a light breakfast, expect me to go for the fried chicken.Lo-Lo's was just alright for me.  I liked the chicken, but I was not fond of the waffles.  They were a little too... thin?  Light?  I dunno how to describe it, but I like my chicken AND my waffles to have a little crunch.  And there was kind of an interesting taste to the waffles.  I can't put my finger on the flavor.I liked the atmosphere okay, but I probably won't be back.I know Mrs. White's Golden Rule Cafe is not for everyone, but honestly I prefer the feel there.  It feels less "affected" by its customers, I guess.  For some reason I am finding it hard to come up with the words here, but Lo Lo's feels like it is the more popular cousin of Mrs. White's... you know... the one with the Letter in Football.Anyway, I am glad Lo-Lo's is thriving...  Maybe I will try the Scottsdale location sometime to see if they have a different spin on things.~~#~0
Mi Patio is a solid 3 star restaurant. Some days the food tastes better than others. And some days the entertainment value is better than others. But it's not a chain, it's within walking distance and has very affordable margaritas.There's no bike rack (ugh) and the taquitos are basically a carne asada taco with no toppings (which I happen to like).~~#~0
I'm no regular here, but on occasion I get a craving for an Iced Mocha that tastes like chocolate milk. Tully's has that down. That's the only thing I've ever ordered here (I go elsewhere for my usual espresso needs), so I can't speak on the rest of their drinks. But, I don't imagine the rest of their drinks being bad; their Iced Mochas are very enjoyable.The service can be spotty. There are a couple ladies that work there that are sweet and take good care of the customers. But I've also encountered a couple of employees that aren't friendly and/or are super slow. Whatever; Tully's isn't my usual haunt. But it's good for what it is: fast-food-coffee.~~#~0
Yogi's is a great place to grab a quick, fairly-cheap meal. I love the Arizona bowl - it's a great alternative for you sushi craving if you don't feel like spending a lot of money.The quality of the food isn't bad. The sushi rolls are alright. The staff is moderate - they've never done anything to impress me, but haven't done anything to disappoint either.~~#~0
The location is definitely an older location and isn't as large and updated as other Harkins around the valley.  The biggest theater is on the smaller side compared to the newer locations.  The staff is about average, not rude and not nice.The parking situation is shared in a strip mall, with a Blue Burrito Grill, Pita Jungle and Gelato Spot, so parking is a bit of a challenge. If you are interested in a "no frills" experience, this will do the trick.~~#~0
So, I'll admit that I'm a ***bertos addict...I truly crave this food and I'm not really sure why.  My mom says that she ate nachos w/ jalepenos on a regular basis while pregnant with me.  Maybe that explains it.  Anyway, I've been wanting to try this place forever since they claim to have "the best tortillas in town."  I seized the opportunity to check it out since I had to drop a friend off at the airport this morning.   The exterior certainly leaves a lot to be desired, and the ambiance is about on par with the drunk tank at the fourth avenue jail (a good friend spent a most unfortunate night here and described it in detail).  The cold, stained cement floors, nasty old booths and 70's McDonald's style swivel plastic chairs which likely  needed a new coat of paint back in the early 80's.  I decided on a green chile burrito and my companion ordered the egg/chorizo/potato/cheese burrito.  After waiting for about 5-10 minutes, our number was called.  The first thing I noticed was that the burritos were quite small.   I knew, however, that I was in for a real treat with the piping hot, super chewy freshly made tortilla, and I was not disappointed.  The green chile, while tasty, had too much liquid and after inadvertantly puncturing my tortilla, I was left with a handful of sauce.  I certainly felt more than safe inside this place (despite the somewhat scary clientele) based on the table of twelve Phoenix police officers sitting across from us.  Overall, I would give the atmosphere 1.5 stars, and the food 3.75 stars.   It was definitely different than what I'm used to, and it gave me a small taste of the cultural melting pot known as South Phoenix.~~#~0
5 stars if you are rich and love to throw your wad around1 star if you are on a budget and think plastic surgery is terrifying3 stars if you enjoy window shopping, gawking at the snobbery and mock the fact that some people will spend $3000 on a ugly brown canvas purse with little "LVs" printed on it because it makes you feel good about yourself.4 stars if you go during a mega-sale weekend when the "normal mall chain stores" have clearance - (Bath and Body Works, Gap, Express, Dillards etc, but they also have an H&M)All in all, SFS is a sight to see for the good and for the bad.At the end of the day it makes me want to escape to hills where people put value on the important things in life and not what brand your sunglasses are.~~#~0
The riped mango slices add an extra dimension to a traditional Papaya salad dish. Typically traditional papaya salad (Lao original) is garlicky, lemony sour and pepper varied hot.  The way this dish was made lacked all of those 3 features but the sustitution by the ripe mangos solved that issue and gave it the flavor that it need. By design, I expected that was the intention of this Americanized dish: the individual ingredients thrown in separately and not blended in until it softened, stripped away the traditional spice and saucy elemental aspects of it and you  have something different for a change that the mostly non-minority American diners would enjoy. The papaya salad is usually regarded as an appetizer; a feminine dish usually made by a female(it is also blasphemous for a male cook to make it, and I don't want to know).  But this happened to be the best dish that I experienced at this place. The others were pad thai and some chicken mix with brocolli. Both tasted very Americanized. The pad thai is reminescent of a take out of the "Panda Place", not bad but not special.Overall, by design -Americanized Thai, that attempts to tone done the flavors of the dish and the way ingredients are prepared , it creates a different twist on traditional dishes.  It had to because , for example, you can't throw preserve fish sauce into these dishes like you would in an authentic Thai restaurant that would fume the whole place. In my opinion, I wouldn't call this type of food a downgrade , maybe a "Fusion" and maybe it's lost and that's unfortunate because it needs a direction\ standing of its own.  My group received attentive and high level of services and the ambience of the place is noteworthy; both these factors exceeded the food experience . Parking may be a walk since you are in old town Scottsdale.Based on individual preference , looking at the food alone, this would not be a place I would repeatedly come; it does not provide traditional flavors in the sense that Lao Thai or Thai Esan or Thai Hut does for the same price and nor does it expect one to follow traditional eating ettiquette that is an essence of food from this region. But it would be a place I take those who can't stomach the traditional flavors, I would have to eat a little before coming here.~~#~0
I thought this bagel shop was ok. The bagel sandwich I got was relatively lackluster. I think I will stick to Einsteins for the time being.~~#~0
First time ordering calamari salad...which had a strong onion (??) flavor and tasted weird...Being raised on Vietnamese food, the strangest of foods has been in my mouth, but I think this falls into the acquired taste category...As in I never acquired a taste for this.Pad thai was okay...the noodles were a bit over seasoned. I felt like I should've eaten it with rice to tone down the flavor.Papaya salad was good...still on the look out for that authentic not watered down version, though. Just like my friend's mom makes it! Yum!Thai omelet. Good.The people were really friendly as well, which helps, but you KNOW I'm all about the food.I had takeout and the box for the calamari salad read: "Carimali Salad". :) I love it!~~#~0
Slices or Spinato's? When you're near Tempe Marketplace and don't want to miss the movie you are about to watch you should check this place out. Slices is more of a "New York" style pizza where as Spinato's is more of a homemade style pizza, and I don't say that with any disrespect. In fact, if I had to suggest one of the two places I would most definitely suggest Spinato's. I'll try outline my reasoning behind this choice.Slices just has their "NY" style pizza, and to be quite honest they don't even do it that well. There are tons of places in Phoenix that do "NY" style pizza, and a notable place is Venezia's on Southern and Mill, not too far from Tempe Marketplace. Spinato's does have an "NY" style pizza and a Sicilian pizza, and the latter is actually pretty good.On a Friday night, this place gets somewhat packed for dine-in, but you can order "eat-in". So basically, you order you food, wait to be seated, and then shortly after being seated you can get your food. This worked out pretty well. The service is also good, and the staff are pretty friendly. Bathroom was small, one bathroom for the whole place, but it was clean and well kept. The pizza was very interesting, we got a Sicilian "Traditional Vegetarian" pizza. Essentially, if you could compare it to another pizza it'd be DiGiorno. Seriously though, the pizza reminded me a lot of DiGiorno's frozen pizza. This place has a unique homemade feeling to it, and even the pizza. I'm not saying its bad, its just unique. The crust is actually delicious, and I usually don't care too much about the taste of the crust, but this one actually tasted pretty good. The downside though is the way they served it, nothing to pick up slices with, and it was super easy for toppings to slide through the grill when it was warm. It became somewhat of a pain to handle the first few slices. This place has serious selection issues. Let's see, pork, pork, more pork, and a little bit more pork, oh and a little bit of vegetarian stuff. Ok, so where does that leave kosher meat eaters? Not at this place. If you eat kosher meat, and enjoy it on your pizza, this is not the place to come. There is literally no chicken or beef available here in terms of toppings.This place is pretty good and moderately priced. My significant other and I shared a 14" sicilian, and got waters which totaled to something like $15. Certainly not a terrible price, but for the price I think we could do a little better. I suppose if we wanna catch a movie after dinner we would visit this place, but it is certainly isn't on the top of our pizza visiting list. Its good pizza, it filled me up, it was tasty, but pizza is a competitive market.~~#~0
Was in the mood for a nice, classic dirty martini last night and R.J. (bartender) filled the void perfectly. Served with a skewer of small,  delicious Kalamata olives. This was a pleasant twist to the big, green olives. The martini was clean, smooth and perfectly balanced. Thumbs up R.J.! On the other hand, the Vegetarian Falafel burger that I ordered was thumbs...sideways. I've had falafel burgers and traditional fried falafel countless times before so I was stoked to see it on their menu. My experience was a disappointment in flavor and texture. The burger was completely bland and could have used a little extra texture. The burger is touted as Michael Mina's mother's recipe. So I really hate to give it a negative review. Perhaps Chef Mina should step Mom's recipe up a notch! #Just saying. When my server asked how my food was, I let him know that I wasn't a fan. His response was,  "Ok, I'll let the chef know" and sheepishly walked away. Huh!??? That's it? Our server was very pleasant and attentive, but when it came to responding to "I don't care for my meal" he could have done better. And frankly, if I wasn't with business associates, I would have sent the burger back. I felt that instead of simply saying "I'll let the Chef know" he should have asked if he could bring me something else. I accidentally skipped lunch and starving, so I ate the burger...reluctantly. I've been to Bourbon a few times but always just sit in the bar which I think has great ambiance. The last time I was there, me and my friend ordered classic cheeseburgers. We asked for them to be cooked medium. We got medium-well. The beef is high quality, so the taste was good and we didn't complain. But still, we ASKED for medium. The red onion rings were delish however. Question is: can I get a consistent meal at Bourbon Steak? Jury is still out.~~#~0
So let me start by saying the latte was very good, best I've had in this area at least. Much better than Starbucks, even though that's not a very high standard but one that everyone can relate to. Good atmosphere, comfortable seat and lots of it... The live music was deceiving as it looked good for the out side (don't we all) and sounded horrible (but I'm not reviewing that am I) :) I was actually helped by a guy there who matched the place well. Good service with a grin and not the overly caffeinated pep talk baristas of a certain chain often feel pressured to give.I'll be back if only for the latte.~~#~0
I appreciate any airport restaurant that doesn't feel over-crowded or cramped.  We usually have to stop in Phoenix for our layover going to and from California from Texas, so I think this might be our new dinner spot.  It's big, plenty of seating, and clean.I love the affordable menu options...especially for being in an airport.  My husband and I both got the taco plates (mine steak and his fish) which come with two soft corn tortilla tacos, black beans, and rice.  The tacos were tasty but the rice and beans were flavorless and the rice seemed a bit undercooked.  After I drenched everything with hot sauce I was able to finish my meal.Although I love the cheap food options (around $6 for a taco or burrito meal), the drinks were super expensive.  Our Bloody Mary was $11!  My mango fresca (non-alcoholic) was about $4.The service was good and we don't really have any complaints.  This is a good option for someone looking for something not too greasy or heavy.~~#~0
I am going to give Aunty Chiladas 3 stars only because I have gone there since I was like 10.  This place has been a staple in the valley before the 51 went by etc etc.  It definitely looks like it has been there for a while and needs a good  asthetic cleaning.  Our table and chairs were sticky and it was pretty dirty outside on the patio.  There were chairs and miscellaneous items on the outside of the restaurant and it needs some TLC.Chips (flour) are good but salsa has black olives (yuk, personal preference) and the hot stuff tasted like it had vinegar in it.  It has a great patio for daytime drinking.  Overall the food is above average.I ordered the fish tacos and they were good.  My accomplice ordered a combo with your typical rice, beans, enchilada, taco etc.  The food was hot and good.  It didn't have a wow factor but the price was good and worth the money.Holy smokes.......The service was awful.  I am not going to mention any names but it was slow in terms of business and even slower in terms of service.  I hope that they do not correlate but they usually do.  C'mon Aunty you are better than this!!!!!!  If you live in the neighborhood then it is worth going here.  I probably will not make the drive again.  Good luck Aunt Chiladas.~~#~0
Rolling Hills is two executive courses, and great for a quick cheap round of golf.  Totally not an out of towner destination course, but a nice little local fave of mine.  The front nine is the old course, and is a bit like mini-golfing, a fun distraction.  You even get to hear the occasional strange animal sound from the zoo hidden behind the trees along a couple holes.  The back nine is a newer build, and is way more challenging and scenic.  Either way they both give a fantastic view of the valley, and it's a great place to play a quick 9 holes after work in just over an hourOnly eaten at the clubhouse once, but both me and my bud liked our burgers, and it sits next to the 9th green, which is great for a little free entertainment.~~#~0
I am an avid quilter and moved here recently. I am on the hunt for a new quilt shop and I went here, despite the "grandma quilt shop" name lol. The staff was VERY nice and helpful and friendly. The shop a little on the small side, which made me surprised to find that they have a very decent selection of contemporary fabrics! My only disappointment is that that they don't have fat quarters cut of each of the fabrics, though they will cut fat quarters - but that's not something I want to have to wait around for. They carry a small selection of minky and home dec fabrics as well. I will definitely be back there!~~#~0
I was craving something last night and couldn't figure out what I wanted. I happened to stumble across this place and decided to give it a try. I ordered the house fried rice and some crab rangoon. Now the crab rangoon were pretty good and I was actually bummed that you only got four but it was only about $2.50 so I cannot complain too much. The fried rice was just ok. For it to be house friend rice, which comes with beef, chicken, pork and shrimp, I can understand not having alot of the shrimp but it didn't have much of anything. I mean it tasted ok, but I was hoping for a little bit more meat than there was. It was a quick meal considering I didn't really know what I wanted to eat anyway. I may give it another try and hope that it's a little better next time.~~#~0
Having grown up in Hong Kong and having eaten dim sum in London, NY, LA, SF and Vancouver (actually Richmond), I can confidently say I know my dim sum.Good selection of well-executed dim sum when the carts actually come around and there's anything left in it.  I'd give it 4 stars for food but the wait definitely detracted from the whole experience.I think the problem with Golden Buddha is that they can't handle the heavy flow on weekends.  There's not enough regular dim sum eaters like LA that can sustain a steady flow of diners throughout the week, forcing restaurants like Golden Buddha to depend heavily on extra part-time help on weekends.  Dim sum takes serious skill so the chef still ends up doing most of the work.  When we looked into the kitchen, we saw a Chinese woman doing most of the cooking herself.  No wonder it took forever for a cart to come out and when it does, it's swarmed on by a pack of vultures.If you're willing to eat at a more simply decorated place with a smaller menu, I'd highly recommend China Chan.  It's much more relaxed - usually no wait on weekends.  An experienced chef makes all the dim sum himself so the menu's much shorter but all the classics are on it.  Anything steamed is made to order so is very fresh.~~#~0
I was extremely excited to try what is considered some of the "best pizza" in America..., finding out it was only minutes away from my new office. My expectations may have been too high. Our party of four went for a late lunch, we did not have to wait for a table. My fiance and I decided to try 2 pies, the margherita and the Biancoverde. The Margherita pie came out quite dry, not with the wonderful chewy crust that a great margherita should have... however, the Biancoverde, a white pizza with Ricotta and arugala, was fantastic! Incredible flavors, the extra toppings kept this pie perfectly moist and delicious, it was really quite perfect. Unfortunately, we had a hair in one of our pizzas, however, that's only part of the reason for the mediocre rating... The hair, the 1-2 star margherita, and the non-existant meat selection I can only give a 3 star rating... (I'm a bit of a carnivore, I need more meat!)I'm still looking for something to replace the incredible pizzas I've had at my favorite neopolitana joing back home in Canada, Famoso. Will I be back to Pizzeria Bianco for another go? Absolutely...~~#~0
So I started getting a cold yesterday and wanted some more soup it was late already 8pm so hunny went off on the search for soup since it was Mothers Day n' all. He ended up at Manuels dont ask me why!! Our white neighbor loves eating here, he had heard from somewhere or someone that they had the best albondiga (meatball) soup?! Well it was wayyy tooo salty other than that it was ok kinda spicey not too hot though. I don't eat meat but the kid liked the meatballs it looked like they had rice in them anh herbs too who'd a thunk. Chips were a tad too greasy and the salsa wasn't too bad good heat, beans were good rice was alright. If it is necessary and in a pinch again I'd go again but prob not.~~#~0
I didn't have an outstanding experience in this place.Breakfast was typical and service was rushy.  Solid 3 starsBiscuits were yum~~#~0
Came here the other night in a party of 17.  Overall the experience was satisfying.  The waitresses were nice (yes, some had serious cleavage) and they were mostly on top of things - ordering the kids plates first, getting drinks/orders put in.The drinks were huge - I had a margarita which was served in a wine carafe.  Unfortunately there was hardly any alcohol in it so I supplemented with a shot of silver tequila.  Probably could have used a couple more shots!I had the baby back ribs.  The order was huge and I did my best.  The meat was tender and the sauce spicy.  Overall it exceeded my expectations (which weren't too high given what I've read here).  The plus was the entertainment value with people trying to ride the mechanical bull.  Only one person from our group did it - after 4 shots of Jack Daniels!Overall a great place to go to if you're looking for a casual place with some eye candy, decent food, and side entertainment.~~#~0
I really wan to like this place more because it gets some of the best acts in town, but it is cramped, stuffy, the stage is too low, the sound quality is not great and they do not serve alcohol so the crowd is kind of stiff and non-fun.  I will keep going because as previously stated, they get some of the best acts in town, but... let's hope they work on the format.~~#~0
Ra Sushi offers average sushi grade.  This chain of restaurants offers a hip atmosphere with loud music and a great place to take down some drinks while eating.  As an Asian I'm a little more passionate about the rating topic for Ra.  If you don't have much  to say about a restaurant please think about rating it four stars.~~#~0
The best place to skip work and goofy golf in the spring and summer. Sure, it's a little musty, old, run-down... but it's a slice of my childhood and at least it's still here. I can't gather the courage to ride the roller coaster anymore and bumper cars just aren't as appealing as they once were but the two story arcade still makes me squeal a little.The golf is great too! I would suggest playing courses one through three. The last two times I've been we played course four and three and four has the least amount of attractions. Courses one and two are busiest, so it's a choice between being stuck behind a bunch of kids or some really un-fun holes.Oh, and they do have a black and white photo booth.~~#~0
Went here with an Indian friend so I can't tell you what I ate, BUT it was tasty. We went 5:15pm on a Thursday and it was pretty empty, but as the night progressed more and more people filled the place out.They do have a lunchtime buffet but not sure the price or quality of food, but if it's anything like the dinner we had...its worth checking out.~~#~0
Lack-lusterI have been disappointed the two times I have visited Houston's.  Their veggie burger is soggy and grainy at the same time (I am not sure how they managed that)...not an appealing taste.  Their "famed" baked potato was dry and was nothing out of the ordinary.  Frankly, I could have made something better for myself and saved the money.  The redeeming factor was that the service was decent and the restaurant was semi-attractively decorated.  Overall I would not come back unless I have to (aka my friends drag me along)*** Was informed by a fellow yelper that the place re-opened down the block under a different name, HillstoneI hope the new name was followed by a new menu.~~#~0
Got the free coupon, so we headed there for lunch today.  I was surprised, the burger was a lot better than I expected! Filing, juicy, fresh toppings.  The fries were above-average, but for what it's worth, I can't stand Five Guys fries or In N Out's.  So if you're a big fan of those, you may not agree with me here.  Super clean place, friendly staff.  Lots of parking for now...until Potbelly opens in a couple of weeks and the lot will be packed (sidenote:  I will pass up Habit for Potbelly every day of the week, but that's a different review.)Overall good burger and fries.  I'd like to try something else off the menu next time. That being said, I'd go back.~~#~0
I want the Garage to do well. It is still a work in progress, though. Three of us visited two weeks ago. We were sat right next to a group of 40 - 55 year old ladies out for a surprise birthday. What's with that anyways. Do you really need to go to a somewhat small restaurant with your pack of "girls," and occupy a large swath of the dining area? Do you need all the paraphernalia (collages, centerpieces, hats)? I was seriously waiting to see a youngish birthday girl. Nope, she was the oldest. 60, easy. Act your age. While you're at it, you are not a size six anymore. Needless to say, it was loud. At least one of the revelers apologized right when we sat. As if that's any conciliation for the volume 11 cackling. First off, the Garage has good brewskis. Not a huge supply, but what they have is quality. We had wings and truffle oil deviled eggs. Both were great. I had Schriner's Sausage Flat bread, and it was great. Wife had something, I forget, and said it was good. Friend had some large salad and said it was good, too. Overall, food was better than most. So, why the three stars you ask? Service. Why do some cool places slip up on this? Is it because they hire "cool people" or friends that don't really want to work? First off, a server (we were seated at the entrance/ exit to the kitchen) dropped a glass bottle of ketchup five feet from my foot. My wife and I had splatter on our jeans and glass near our sandal clad feet. Hardly a response. We were handed a rag. Our server not so sympathetically wondered, "Oh, they almost dropped a bottle of ketchup on you." The rest of the night just seemed a little disorganized and not relaxing? Every server seemed in the weeds or confused. Empty beer and water glasses. Entrees arrived and empty app plates sat there. $60 for three for apps, dinner and beers.~~#~0
This is the first Springhill Suites that I've stayed at.  Service was good.  Hotel was clean.  Room was acceptable.  Big enough to work in, nothing special.   Fitness Room was small but that was fine as I was the only one using it.  The breakfast on par for what you would receive when you stay at a hotel.  They could use better coffee.Very nice hotel to stay at if you have business at the convention center.~~#~0
Coming into the Phoenix area for a family party, we stopped off at Los Sombreros for some margaritas and Mexican on an otherwise cooler night in the valley of the sun. I was told they are very picky about reservations and, if your party isn't complete, no table. So our 6pm reservation was now in jeopardy because the last two of us (me and my fiance) were running late due to issues on the ramp at Sky Harbor airport, obviously out of our control. But they still didn't want to seat us...  additionally, I overhead on the way to the place that they would only "try" to do their best to accommodate our party, making it sound like they were booked up solid until closing....typical Scottsdale always trying to look more happening and hot than it really is. Moving on, we somehow "lucked out" (go figure) and had a table no problem, so all the stress caused by the hostess was unnecessary and, in my opinion, pretty unprofessional, especially since the restaurant was empty by 8pm, again, typical Scottsdale. The menu was brief, and I almost had to double check I wasn't looking at an appetizer. Most of the items are typical Mexican staples with a bit of a Southwestern American twist to them making the food a hit or miss if you ask me, some items were good, some were not. But that's really anywhere I suppose. The one thing that stood out for me was the Guac. I will say this was flat out delicious but Guac is pretty had to screw up. The margaritas in my opinion reminded me of something you'd get more at Chilis, a little too sweet for my liking but definitely drinkable. The fundidto appetizer we ordered left the table empty twice and well I'm not really one to combine seafood and cheese, this blend seemed to have a harmony with others and I'd recommend it to a first timer, +1 if you request to add spinach. Finally moving on to the entrees, different contraptions from the kitchen filled our table with vibrant colors, assortments and sizes. I myself ordered what I was told is sort of the house specialty ,call it carnitas mixed in a chipotle sauce with veggies type of deal. While it was tasteful and was more than enough to get the job done for me, the flavor of the pork wasn't really there, at, all. I browsed over a couple other reviews and noted the same complaint but hey that's what hot sauce is for I guess. Overall it's an alternative to the chains hoarding Scottsdale road.~~#~0
I feel as though this is strictly a local central Phoenix bar.  Anyone from out of town probably wouldnt appreciate it as much as a local would.  Before I started coming here I heard it was a tranny bar which it definitely is.  However besides weekends you will only see one or two hanging around.  Its karaoke is almost alwasy extremely busy which leads to long wait times to sing but its alright because the people there are pretty friendly.  The only two complaints I have is (first) the occasional scummy person that comes in that just got out of jail or is high on drugs.  I do wish they would do a better job at kicking these people out.   My second complaint is the very small and usually dirty restroom.  I like this place because I know the bartenders and the people that frequent this bar.  Others might not be able to appreciate it as much.~~#~0
Love the location and the re-purposed historical house Stoked that the tortillas are fully warmed like a good tortilla should be. Crave the creamy, non-lard beans even more than the carne asada. Diggin the outdoor picnic tables. Hesitant to order the corn because sometimes it has too much sauce n cheese, which overpower the pure joy of grilled corn. Not so crazy about my last experience where the cashiers showed more personality talking to each other or the kitchen crew than they did to me while taking my order. I'm paying $6 for a burrito, could it hurt to smile and maybe offer me a happy hour beer when I'm here picking up my take out dinner?~~#~0
Went here for dinner on a Saturday night.  Put our names in...and only had to wait about 30 min. Not too bad. The bar was a little too crowded to wait there, so we went a couple of doors down to pass our time.On to dinner...we had a great server.  He was super friendly, nice and was vocal with his opinions.  I would love to tell you that all of his reccs were spot on...but they weren't.We started with the pretzels and the cheese fondue. DELISH.  I went halfsies with my friend and we shared the prime rib sammie and the shrimp caesar salad.  The prime rib sammie was mediocre.  The beef wasn't flavored at all, and when we got the fries, they were cold.  Hot plate, cold food..not a good sign.We did get fresh fries, I didn't finish my half, and moved on to the salad.  The salad was good, but not great.All in all, I would go for a drink and some apps, but wouldn't really want to eat dinner here again.  I may have just ordered wrong...but two meh things do it for me.~~#~0
I read quite a few reviews on Yelp prior to checking this place out with a group of 10 or so.  We arrived and the table wasn't ready just yet - we ordered a variety of cocktails, menu driven cocktails, beer and wine. I had an 8th Street Ale - always a good choice.  I had to ask for a cold glass to put it in and when I was served the 2nd one, they didn't include it. I had to ask again.The food:  Pretty good, actually. However, its totally overpriced and the portions are pretty small. So it makes the hurt on the wallet that much more severe.  Our waitress was cool, she put up with a lot of conversations in our group, sometimes being loud and not paying attention.I would go back again, but most likely for lunch. Hopefully you would get the same size meal for a few bucks less.  By the way, I had the pasta with rib eye in it (I forget the name) and my wife had the Carbonara.  They were both good!~~#~0
When Fresh & Easy started popping up everywhere, it was my new favorite go to place for quick and easy meals.  They have a great selection of ready made entrees and salads that beat going through the drive through. The fact that there were always excellent coupons to be received could have been a big factor in why I returned so often. Key word, WERE, I think they have lightened up on their coupon circulation!The problem started when I began to do my actual grocery shopping here.  They have great prices on a limited, but satisfactory, amount of grocery items.  Its the produce and veggies that are troublesome.  I find that they start to go bad after 2 or 3 days, which isn't very convenient or money saving when it means I am throwing half of what I buy away.  I am very conscious of expiration dates on items, and have even found myself throwing away items prior to their expiration.   So, unless your planning on cooking with your fresh items that day, I would avoid the produce and even some dairy and meat items. So what I am saying is, frozen, dry or canned stuff...I am pretty sure your safe with.This location in particular has also been my least favorite to visit as far as friendly staff.  I usually have to bag my own groceries....yeah, I know, self checkout keeps the prices down, however, when you have 2 or 3 staff members just hanging out by the registers with little or no people in line, it wouldn't hurt for someone to jump on bagging groceries...its a little customer service that may save someone from not returning!~~#~0
It's pretty clean little place good tacos enchiladas and tostadas but not big on the chilie beef really lacked any flavor.  Like another yelper said, they need a big menu board.  If I was near by I may or may not stop by, I'd prefer Some Burros for this type of venue .~~#~0
I've gotten lunch take out here a few times. The only thing I've tried is the drunken noodles. While I think they are pretty decent, I have been having serious issues getting the right spicy-nes. The first time I got them, I asked for level 3 spicy. Their spice meter goes from 0-5. I love love hot and spicy Thai food, however these noodles were practically inedible. Yet, they were so delicious at the same time I devoured the entire thing. And I felt like I was going to die later, as my stomach felt like a fishnet stocking...The second time I ordered them I asked for level 2 spicy. This time they were not spicy at all. At all!! They were so bland. I mean, they still tasted good, but were missing that drunken noodle kick! So, at this point I don't know what to do. Obviously every cook there must have a different idea of what each number means. The last time I ordered from here, I simply said drunken noodles. I didn't specify a spicy level. I figured maybe this would give me the perfect in between spicy that I so desired! Well, when I got them, they were more bland than the level 2. And tasted kinda weird. I will give them another try as they are right across the street from my work, and I hope we can work out our spicy issues! 4 stars for the service, they're really friendly here2 stars for the food, until we can work out our issuesAnd 4 stars for the convenience!~~#~0
Very well done pizza...its like a pizza pillow, tasty, savory and rather doughy.This is not my favorite style of pizza but nonetheless it was especially good pizza.  The service staff was top notch and the store is very warm and inviting.We will be back!~~#~0
Alright, I'm not really sure I can give this place a fair assessment based on food.  I came here last week and ordered the Lox and Bagels.  So the plate came out to me and it consisted of Bagel (I'm going to go on a limb and say they are not made in house) cream cheese, a pre-made product, Lox, a pre-made product (although damn good Lox) capers, pre-made product, sliced tomatoes, and sliced red onions.  So basically all they had to do is toast my bagel, and slice the onion and tomato and then just plate.  Nothing revolutionary here.  So this is why I cant really give Tryst a fair assessment.  I would have to go back and actually order something that was cooked.  It was a cute little place and has a lot of potential considering where it is located.  I have to go back again and update this review.~~#~0
Corporate... Juice... PIMPS!!! I lurve me some corporate pimp juice! I've been a fan of Jamba's juices for quite a few years... but over time, I had forgotten about the joys of Jamba until my sister (Reylynne W.) We went and I got something with oranges and strawberries in it... i unno what it had... but damnit it was good! :) Nice, clean and fresh, I loved every thick sip. :)~~#~0
If I were to have written this review 2 years ago, it would have been 5 stars, but the portions keep on shrinking at an alarming rate. Today I had the meat plate and no more than 2 tablespoons of pulled pork, and brisket were on the plate. Also, what's with the staff? They are like robot drones! Absolutely no personality! The food's flavor, and quality, however, are very good, the place is always sqeaky clean.. and of course the decor is very amusing. Being a hungry hungry hippo, I would prefer a slight price increase, to maintain portion size.~~#~0
This was supposed to be my trip to have the best pizza in America. So imagine my disappointment that they don't even serve it at lunch. What human who eats pizza thinks it should only be served at dinner?  Whaaat?  I have since been kindly corrected by another yelper that this restaurant isn't the pizzeria. My party was confused, since the server said they DO serve pizza...at dinner. The soprassata focaccia sandwich was fine, but overpriced by about $3. I don't live here to try it again, so the first impression is the only impression. I'll leave it to all you foodie hipsters to prop up the rating.~~#~0
3 friends and I went for restaurant week.  Iruna has great ambiance and charm.  The service was top-notch, and our server made excellent wine recommendations.  The desserts were amazing.  The other food was just ok.  Here's what we had:tapas - tortilla espanola (which was complimentary) was delicious; chistorra (chorizo in cider w/ baby artichokes) was also good; pan con tomate was surprising because it didn't seem to be tapas.  rather it was huge chunks of grilled bread that didn't work well to distribute flavors and was oily.entrees - trout with salsa navarra, eggplant, roasted peppers, onion and tomato was very nicely cooked and had a nice balance of flavors.  filet mignon with tomatoes and salbitxada was order medium rare but delivered very well done and over-salted.  It was refired, and v2 was the right temperature but still over-salted.  we glanced at the patio on the way out which looks fantastic.  We return to try some other tapas and sangria on their outdoor couches.~~#~0
Valle Luna bats .250.  Not high enough to put in the middle of the lineup (hell, probably not enough to even start), not low enough to send back down to AAA.  Completely average.  I'll admit, however, to frequenting the restaurant primarily for its bar which seemingly promotes about 17,696 drink specials and more on football sundays.  Other than that, there isn't really a whole lot to say one way or another.  Perhaps that says more than a lengthy review ever could...~~#~0
It gets all three stars for the view.  For the prices charged the food should be oh, so much better.  And the selection is very limited.  But if you are trying to impress a date, and aren't too hungry, this is a very romantic location...~~#~0
I must be spoiled and realize that this is not a big grocery store. I tend to think the store is a good place in a pinch for Asian ingredients. Mostly, Chinese and Vietnamese products for those looking for Japanese products might have to go elsewhere. In a pinch it is great, hopefully with local support this store can improve.~~#~0
This Dunkin Donuts is hit or miss.When i run in here for just coffee, the service is usually very fast and prompt. When i run in there to order coffee and food, that usually becomes a circus. There have been times when i've waited over 20 minutes for my food. Usually it's not a problem, but when you have a business meeting that you have to attend to, it is. Fast food, pffft. Bring a sleeping bag.~~#~0
This place is nowhere near where yelp says it is. It is at Chandler and Ray road not in the industrial area.~~#~0
I like the lunch better than the breakfast at "First Watch", which is a bit ironic I suppose. Perhaps it should be named Second Watch?But on to what I do like...The "Not Guilty Your Honor" veggie wrap is good. It comes with a side of hummus, fruit and potatoes. Big meal!The "Burrito Vera Cruz" breakfast burrito was pretty good. The Vera Cruz sauce is a mixture of salsa and hollandaise. I've never had it before trying it here and it was actually pretty tasty!Mango iced tea is good! And they'll give you some to go if you ask!Somethin about the potatoes just doesn't cut it for me though... And as I mentioned earlier, the breakfast just isn't my favorite. I just don't dig their omelets much.Sign up for their email club to get a buy 1 get 1 free meal coupon.Note: If you're vegan, order the veggie wrap and substitute avocado for the feta cheese. Get a side of salsa too.~~#~0
I don't get the hype, but then again I am not a regular. The beer selection is top notch, the sandwiches are worth the prices, the cheesecake really shouldn't be drowned in chocolate syrup but who cares, it really is a nice people watch place. I appreciate the well composed menu and not much more can be said. It has reliable service and sandwiches, hipsters and good beer. The lack of surprises make it a good place to take out of towners to see downtown and introduce people to First Fridays if you wanna brave potential waits, noise levels, and lack of parking on busy nights.~~#~0
ordered the steak sandwich (medium rare).  Came out cooked medium.  Still very delicious.  French fries were not good, way too salty.  Server seemed as though he did not want to be there, with a grouchy attitude.~~#~0
This was the first Mexican restaurant my boyfriend and I had eaten at when we moved to Arizona. We had good hopes since we were in the West now. Not the case- there is a few good and a few bad:GOOD: It is a great location, in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale. Walking distance from our house !! The patio is the reason we selected this place; not too loud, secluded and enough space between tables  . The food is also pretty good. Chips are awesome and so is the salsa ( I always judge the Mexican restaurants I go to by their salsa )BAD: the first time we went the service was just okay. But we just figured it was because we came on a Friday during lunch. But we have gone back to this place 3 other times and the service keeps getting worse and worse . I asked for water 3 times and never got it. My chips are never refiled and it takes FOREVER to get a beer and the bar is right there. I think I watched my beer sit at the bar counter for 20 mins. and of course it was warm when i go it since it was just sitting in the sun. I should have gotten it myself. We will probably drive a little farther to get better service.~~#~0
The Service is great.  The food is ok.  The salsa.....horrible.  Please rethink your salsa.  Oh, and if you order a side of jalapenos they charge $1.99.  I have never heard of a Mexican restaurant charging for jalapenos.  Overall, just an ok place.  There are better options on and around Mill.~~#~0
Eh, this place is okay.  I was not super impressed.  The food was okay.  I was not blown away.   After being seated, we sat at the table for a good 15 minutes without anyone noticing that no one had been to our table once.  We had to flag down a server.  Once we actually did have a server, the service was good.  I can forgive the glitch.  Everyone has a bad night.  But the food just lacked the wow factor.  Even though I have a twenty dollar gift certificate (to make up for the initial service issue) I have not been back.  I guess that about sums it up.~~#~0
I feel bad giving them a mediocre rating but I'm reviewing what's in their NAME. I drove about 9 miles across Gilbert (that is quite a chore) because I wanted to serve good roast beef sandwiches for dinner and I needed good bread. I had Boar's Head roast beef, tomatoes, horseradish sauce, avocado, roasted red peppers etc I just needed great bread. Where else in Gilbert should I go? I did a Yelp search and it agreed - to this place. I arrived around 4:15 and the pickings were slim. I got the last round of sourdough and a small nine grain. I asked her to slice thick, she walked to the slicer and said it has one setting. Okay I'll slice myself. Because I love Cupcakes I also took a chocolate cupcake and my boys got a chewy brownie each. The total was about $16. We got home the bread was hard (both) soft on the deep inside so I had to grill the sandwiches with butter not my plan but it's butter, butter fixes everything. The cupcake frosting was good I ate the top threw away the 'cup' not worth the calories. I only allowed the boys to eat half the brownie each and save the other half for tomorrow as they were huge. The said they were really good. Basically, I'll buy my bread at the grocery store or at Paradise bakery as the wasted gas and time in the car was not worth it.~~#~0
The food was decent.  My friend and I had the meatball sub and marinara chicken sub.  I know this is stereotyping but being served food my real Italians I expected more spice and flavor in the food.  The alcohol selection is small but has the essentials (beer and wine). I want to go back and check out the pizzas before I write this place off.~~#~0
Very mixed feelings about this hotel.Location is very close to ASU's tempe campus, so it's convenient if you're visiting ASU. The surrounding city of the hotel is fillllled with methamphetamine addicts. And yes, it is very creepy- and that is coming from a 24 year old male.The customer service INSIDE the hotel was great. The breakfast buffet also tasted good. The hotel rooms are nice, although they only have $5 water available which is annoying and the fridge is LOCKED so you can't store any of your drinks.The reason why I docked 2 stars was not so much the tweakers, as it was the LOUD clunk sound whenever the AC turns off. From what I've heard, this happens in every room.So, if you need to sleep with AC at night (and you will, in the summer) - be SURE to buy or bring ear plugs. It's the only way to get through the night - trust me....~~#~0
Decent little taco stand sort of restaurant. The burrito that I had was good, nothing to shout about, but a solid breakfast burrito. The nice thing about it was that you can order breakfast foods all day and it still tasted good.Mine came out pretty quick, but my friend's burrito was quite long in arriving. They have some good combination burritos that aren't significantly more expensive like the ones you might try to get at other places. I would visit again to get a second opinion of the place.~~#~0
Narcisse couldn't be more appropriately named...another Scottsdale scene club with a lively but predictable crowd of scantily dressed cougars, Middle Eastern royalty and upscale business folk. The music is hoppin and thumpin late and leans toward House, which is why I added two stars. We actually entered by taking an elevator up and walking through a kitchen in rather cinematic style, emerging right onto the dance floor, which was packed. I guess it pays to know someone. The champagne selection is outrageous here and packed though it was, our drinks arrived in seconds. The sky-high patio is a nice place to chill and check out the little skyline, but it's all about getting your dance on here. I would like to check it out for happy hour when fewer people are bumping into you and stepping on your feet. The Russian mobster-channeling bouncers are a little intimidating, but treated us well. An uber enthusiastic dancer knocked into my friend and shattered her Veuve glass, and all was whisked and mopped in seconds. The music sure beats the tired 90s cover bands that seem to be epidemic in this area.~~#~0
My wife wanted to go here a few weeks back for her birthday so we went on a Saturday afternoon.  Parking was easy to find and there was no wait to get a table.  Wish it had been a touch cooler, but it wasn't so we decided to eat indoors.  Had a little snafu with our servers where someone who was not our waiter took our drink orders, but it was straightened out pretty quickly.  We each ordered one of the signature drinks, the wife got cucumber lemonade (I think) and I got a green arnold palmer.  I liked the g.a.p.  For the meal, don't remember what the wife had, I got the chicken sausage pizza.  It was fine, nothing out of the ordinary.  Basically, that's how the whole meal was, okay, but didn't blow me away (not that I'm a huge healthy/organic foodie kind of guy though).  I guess I'd go here again, but I probably wouldn't suggest it.  (I did think the music was a little loud...)~~#~0
I have been to the original Vig and was happy to see that they were opening the Vig Uptown within walking distance of mi casa.  So far, I've only been able to schlep over on weekends for brunch.  I'll say that the food is good, but the service on my last trip was pretty lacking.  At one point, my BF & I sat for nearly 20 minutes between the coffee delivery and the actual order taking.  That seemed to be the standard for the day in what was a pretty empty restaurant.  kept me from giving that 4th star for sure.~~#~0
Went here for lunch on a weekday and thought it'd be busier. The slower setting allowed for more personal attention though. The chef even came out to talk to us and gave us free samples of some of the desserts. The food was good, but didn't blow me away. I think it's a nice option for a snazzier (it's a little pricey) lunch with friends.~~#~0
I've lived near Old Town Scottsdale for years and in all that time I've never really taken to the streets by foot, aside from a weekly visit to the Farmers Market. At first glance you ask yourself how many Indian jewelry shops can the area possibly sustain? Well the answer is, the turquoise market in Old Town seems to be doing quite well. So it was on a recent exploration trip that we happened upon David's Hamburger's and Mexican Food. So for me the idea of killer burger and tasty Mexican good is a match made in heaven, were talking major food groups here. Tucked between 2 galleries, David's is a blink and you'll miss it kind of place, very unassuming and humble. Inside you won't be wowed by the interior design but what they do have is functional and comfortable. With TV's at both ends of the hall like space, you'll be entertained by performance videos of 50's era rock 'n roll. I usually don't write much about soda pop, well never, but in this case the Cherry Coke ($1.95) was kind of special. When you order a Coke you can ask them to add a number of different flavorings from lemon and vanilla to chocolate and of course cherry. David's version is wonderfully fizzy and cuts through the richness of the upcoming meal. Of all the ways Mexican style meat is prepared, the grilled taste of beef is my all time favorite. If you enjoy this as much as I do then Id suggest the Carne Asada Nachos ($8.59). A massive pile of crunchy tortilla chips is covered in grilled beef strips, melted cheese, guacamole, sour cream and pico de gallo. While basic, I ate most of them myself leaving my partner to scraping the cheese off of the plate. If you'd like salsa on your chips, be sure to ask them to bring you bowls of green and red salsa. Now who doesn't like a big juicy hamburger? David's doesn't disappoint with David's Single ($5.99), say that 2 times fast. A 1/3lb patty topped with the usual suspects, then dressed with David's creamy sauce which to me was a thick version of Thousand Isle dressing, adding a layer of tangy goodness. Along side you have your choice of fries or you can choose to upgrade ($.99) to a mix of large deep fried onion rings and golden French fries. For dipping I a side of David's sauce did the trick in lieu of ketchup. The Patty Melt ($7.25) is classic diner food. We're talking thick ground beef patty, melted cheese and grilled onions on your choice of grilled sourdough or rye bread. The wholesome grease from the beef patty and grilled onions is absorbed into the bread creating a creamy like texture, for me this is what a patty melt is all about. Of course the Guacamole Burger ($6.25) with its pepper jack cheese, bacon and guacamole is the marriage of Mexican and American influence. If you're an early riser, David's also serves breakfast like Bacon Pancakes ($6.75) and Coconut Waffles ($6.25). Someone please pass the syrup. My only question, where is the breakfast burrito?~~#~0
Pei Wei is always busy, that's gotta mean something right? Wrong. There are restaurants that serve billions yet all they serve is a gross mystery. Pei Wei is no mystery though, the food is cooked in an open air kitchen. Even so, if there were such a thing as Asian fast food, Pei Wei would be cleaner version of it.Most Pei Wei's are situated in pompous locations where ever there is an AJ Fine Foods, but atleast they aren't located in the ghetto.As far as the food goes, it is about as Americanized as you can get. So if you live in America and have American taste buds, it will appeal to you. Unfortunately if you want authentic Asian food you won't find it at Pei Wei. I don't understand why they even bother to put chopsticks on the table, the rice isn't even sticky enough to pick it up with. They are for decoration. They are part of the 'fake' Asian dining experience. Apparently, Pei Wei serves food "manadrian style" from Thailand, Vietnam, Japan, Korea, and China. In the words of Bill Lumbergh, "Ooo.. yeahh.. I'm just not sure about that." Having traveled to China I can honestly tell you that Chinese food is different. Apart from the rice, the food lacks vegetable oil and garlic. In China those two ingrediants are used in many dishes and Pei Wei lacks them. When I first started visiting Pei Wei I ordered the Sweet and Sour, but I got sick of it. Sometimes the meat would be tough, sometimes the chicken would clump together all nastily. What I get now-a-days and what I got on this particular day was Mandarin Kung Pao. Even though the dish is spicy, that doesn't mean it has to be dry - and it was. What it was missing was some catalyst to bring out the spicy flavors and make them more vibrant.The dishes at Pei Wei are family style meaning they are meant to be shared with several people. A dish and a drink will end up costing you about $10. If each person gets one dish, that's a lot of food, probably enough to feed a small village in Africa somewhere. It would be nice if they served each dish in two styles, family and single, large and small. Family style is great if you always visit Pei Wei with your family. But if you are out for lunch with people from work you might not want to share your food with your co-workers. They aren't your family. You don't know them.Pei Wei is a modern Asian diner that is probably better than most of the mom and pop Asian diners out there, even if most of the food is cooked by Mexi-- I mean Asians.~~#~0
Good to know they still have independent films and they chose wisely what to play. Unfortunately this location seems to be attracting 40+ yuppies! I was shocked to see how many middle-aged and even elderly were at Camelview. That was a disappointment :/~~#~0
Ok, they should be happy that I am understanding of the flying bug that landed in my dessert and died before it was served.  Yes, I found it as I was eating the dessert, grossed me out, but not necessarily their fault.  The manager came over and apologized and took the dessert off the bill and offered me another one.  Anyway, the rest of the meal was great.  My party and I had the scallops with green beans and capers.  Yummy!  I do like Pappadeaux's overall and this is the first time I didn't have a great experience.~~#~0
Don't get me wrong, White Chocolate Grill is good and definitely a place I will go back to, but there is something that just doesn't click. Everything tastes good and the service is fast and efficient but it is more of a relaxed dinner that a meal you get excited about. I can't say for everyone I really don't like waiting a half hour for a table. Call me impatient I don't care,  I really do not think many restaurants deserve that title even on a Friday night. I do love that they have an entire menu for gluten free diners. It's so hard to find gluten free in restaurants don't even mention an entire menu! I was impressed! I ended up splitting artichokes with parmesan (ask for no bread crumbs) with my mom and got myself a chicken caesar. Both were decent. We did end up ordering a gluten free chocolate soufflé (make sure to specify that you want it gluten free because they had a normal version as well) which was amazing and I would definitely go there just for that. Overall a good family weeknight restaurant that is that is above average meal. Definitely a place to go if you have celiacs or are gluten intolerant.~~#~0
I was so looking forward to going to this restaurant.  It has a nice view of a man-made pond, but the food is barely average.  If the ambience wasn't so nice, it would get only 2 stars.~~#~0
This goodwill is Alright, I have been to better. Their selection is okay, cleanliness is okay and organization is okay. All goodwill's prices are the same, as far as I know. The staff is helpful and I never have trouble finding somebody if I need help.~~#~0
Average airport. I wish gate Marques listed which zone was boarding. There were three airplanes loading at the same time and it was near impossible to tell which gate was loading which zone. We just waited a few minutes and rolled the dice that our zone was loading.~~#~0
The hotel is a throw back in time - friendly people and nice simple resort.  Love the free shuttle in the local area.  The restaurant though is not bad, but the service can definitely be improved especially at breakfast time.~~#~0
The restaurant reminds me of a quaint little countryside café.   It gives me that homey feeling like a mom and pop store instead of the chain restaurant that it is. I like how whatever entrée you order from the menu; you can get a complete meal from it.  Each entrée comes with a drink, bread, soup or salad, and their spumoni ice cream for dessert.  However, if you want "Italian" food, you're not going to get it here.  It's a very Americanized version of Italian food.  They do have all the classics: the pastas, lasagnas, etc.  I've been here several times and tried a few of their dishes.Spaghetti Vesuvius:  cute name to start off.  Spicy chicken sausage and meatballs with mushroom.  I didn't think it was that spicy, but it was extra salty.  It's a very flavorful dish, however the individual tastes are all mushed together.  The noodles are a bit tough for me; perhaps undercooked.  However some people like it a bit tough.  Gourmet Jumbo Crab Ravioli:  There's not a lot of ravioli pieces in the dish.  The edges that were not covered in the pesto alfredo sauce was dry.  I did like that they used fresh crab meat in the ravioli.  The creamy sauce was not bad and it wasn't too overpowering in my mouth.  It was able to taste pesto sauce and still enjoy the texture of the crab.  Baked Lasagna:  This is the best of the 3 I've had.  It has 4 kinds of cheese, ground beef, and pork.  First of all they gave you a huge piece of lasagna. Then they topped it with mounds of marinara sauce.  You may have to remove some of the sauce if it's too much for you.  The noodles were cooked tender enough for my taste, but it was still able to hold its shape.  And the meat was blended well with all the flavors of the dish.  I do like the cute little serving they have of the spumoni ice cream.  It's a great blend of pistachio, chocolate and strawberry.  And it's just the right amount after a large meal.  Maybe one of these days I'll go back just to try their chocolate desserts.  If you like an American spin on Italian food, then you would like this place.  It's a convenient place to eat after shopping at the mall and their quick service is great if you're crunched for time.  But the food is just average and not that special.~~#~0
I'm rather undecided about this place.  The hygienists are great and the staff is all very nice and accommodating.  Every time I have to have a tooth filled (yes I'm totally that person) I feel like I have to go back because something is wrong.  For example not being able to floss between any of the filled teeth because the filling hasn't been filed down correctly.  I don't feel like the dentist really listens to you either.  When I felt like I had a problem with a tooth he told me it was fine and the next time I went back he found a huge cavity in that same tooth and told me I might need a root canal on it because it was so big.  What a pain.~~#~0
I am glad that I remembered this place for brunch this past Saturday because it was good food and I love the atmosphere in the area as well.  I went with my BF and we put our name in, got some coffee and was seated quicker than the time the originally gave us, which is great in my book.  I had the breakfast burrito with chorizo.  I wasnt a fan of it, it was good but not GREAT.  The chorizo really lacked flavor and punch...maybe I am use to the chorizo I get back home.  My bf had pancakes with ice cream on top of it and it looked amazing and he loved it.I would come back and probably will to try some of there other things.  This is not a place to go to thinking you will get in and out quick, there are almost always people waiting but the walk around Old Town Scottsdale is worth it.~~#~0
I've returned to this place 2 more times after my last review. Wait service was still inconsistent, especially with the dimwitted waitress.The restaurant was plagued with "out of foods" often. A few months ago, the dimwitted waitress didn't tell us the appetizer was out till the end when I initiated the inquiry. Apparently she has already removed the "out" item from our bill.The wait service for my last meal with a group of friends was better at 6:30 PM on a Saturday. We've got service from 3 different wait staffs. They were serving everybody else too. Not just us.The food came out fast and the taste was right on this time. They were out of egg plant. We didn't tell them that 99 Ranch Supermarket was 2 doors down.So diners, I still consider this place a good choice for authentic foods. I will give 3.5 stars this time.~~#~0
Where I live in Tempe, I can walk to the end of my street, hop on an Orbit which takes me to the main Bus Depot or can drop me off closer to the Light Rail stop off of Mill Ave. Not bad, right?I actually am enjoying the clustering of a real Bus Depot not anywhere near a residential area with plenty of security, lighting, public enough space in an easily accessible location in Tempe. I actually feel safe hanging out here at night and when I ride my bike to the station, all the bike racks face the security and transit office, so never had an issue with my bicycle here either.The buses themselves are fine, I have had some very bad moments on the bus with the passengers (ie the 1st time I got on a Phoenix bus, a knife-fight broke out and I had to stay for a police report, another time two guys were reading hard porn right across from  me), but its kinda nice mixing with people rather then being in a car-tomb.What I very much have an issue with is most bus stations. I have had bums passed out (dead?)  on the seat, meth heads, a single sign with no seating in the hot blazing sun (I am looking at you Scottsdale), seats no shade around, fights break out at stations. I try to call the metro, they say it isn't their issue. Call the police non-emergency number, they say its the Metro jurisdiction. For this very bad situation alone, I don't take the bus at night since all the stations near the arts area and central are not well lit, full of sketchy people and the buses take too long to come by (if they even stop). For this I am grateful for the light rail for late night Phoenix excursions. Metro still has a lot of work to do, but considering the improvements I have seen with public transportation and bicycle awareness in the past 3 years, it seems to be going on the right route.~~#~0
It's okay. it's nothing like San Francisco food .~~#~0
Its refreshing to find one-of-a-kind places -- God knows Phoenix needs more of them to inject personality into this generic, strip-mall, chains-on-every-corner valley. Finding this unique sandwich shop, which is in a house that has been transformed into a restaurant, is indeed a welcome find. The real estate is limited, so parking is compact and circles around the back of the building.The dining area is mainly indoors, but there is also a small patio facing the back portion of the parking lot, which is not very scenic. Inside there is art on the wall that can be purchased.They serve wraps, bowls and salads. The food has been pretty good, although it did not knock my socks off. I ordered the Baja Bowl, which is described on their online menu as "Southwestern chicken atop garlic rice, black beans, Monterey jack cheese and topped with lime sour cream and pico de gallo." It was OK, but the chicken was dry and cut in fairly large chunks. It could have possibly been microwaved -- not sure, but there were no southwest flavors to speak of. I have done a better job of cooking chicken on my George Foreman grill at home. Perhaps the garlic rice would have helped with the flavor, but I had substituted the rice with organic brown rice which did little to add flavor. Sour cream was not "lime". There was a small slice of lime served on the edge of the bowl. I would not bother ordering this again -- especially if I have a craving for some southwest food.On another recent visit I ordered a wrap called "Prince of Thai's - Spicy peanut chicken with baby spinach, garlic rice, fresh ginger slaw, cucumber pico and red onion wrapped in a spinach tortilla." That had better flavor than the baja bowl. Vegetable ingredients were fresh and good. Again, I was not very impressed with the chicken chunks.One thing I think That's A Wrap needs to address is the use of styrafoam cups. Afterall their slogan is "Healthy Food for a Hungry Planet" and they have a link for a new restaurant "Green" for Vegan food on their website. For such an artsy, earthy place, I would have thought That's A Wrap would have made more conscious, earth-friendly choices. For that reason and the bland chicken, I give them an average rating only.~~#~0
Some friends came in so a group of 6 of us went here.  Cool little place with good atmosphere, basic and cozy.  Wines by the glass were good.  The bread was a bit stale but still pretty decent.  We ordered a variety of things.  The antipasto plate was good with several typical items.  My tomato sausage pizza was good, not great.  Needs some spice and flavor.  The halibut over sundried tomato basil risotto with aspargus was very good but the halibut was a little over cooked.  Otherwise, most everybody liked the food.  One person ordered a dish and asked for a little spice but it was way too spicy and they basically couldn't eat it.  Her husband ate it the next day because he could handle the spice but seriously it was way too spicy for most people.  Not a bad place, would probably go back but won't drive out of the way as the location is a little out there.~~#~0
We stayed for three nights while visiting family for the holidays.Good:Very comfortable bedCleanFunky/cool decor which is uniqueVery friendly and helpful staffFair priceGreat locationNot so good:Pricey overnight parking that was a surprise upon check inNo coffee maker in room; this is pretty well standard for most hotels. We had to either go to the lobby for $4.50 per cup or drive off site. On our final morning before leaving (2 1/2 hours before checkout) with our do not disturb sign duly mounted on the outside of our door, we were disturbed by a rap-rap-rap-rap of who I assume was the cleaner. WTF!~~#~0
The place was pretty empty - even for an off night. The service was pretty decent, but like I said - it was empty. I've been in here a few times, but never when it's busy. The prices don't impress me, but I'd say you get a pretty decent pour for the money. One thing I'd like to point out - a 1.5L bottle of Dom is less than 1000 bucks, but a 3.0L bottle of Dom is 3500. If you're a fucking idiot, get the 3L. If you're a smart shopper, you'll get two 1.5L bottles or else just by the glass - which works out even cheaper. Just so you know, it works the opposite way Costco does. If you're getting a big ass bottle of Dom anyway, you probably don't care.The decor is red. It's very dark in here at night... dark and loungy rather than clubby. Similar to Merc Bar, but not as hip or hidden... even though they try to hide it with curtains. It's also pleasantly quiet in here... easy to have conversations. With the patio door open, you're going to smell cigarettes people are smoking outside if you're sitting at the bar or on the couch adjacent to there. It's a nice bar, but I don't know that I'd single it out as a "place to be." I actually think the Mondrian is pretty nice - but that's based entirely on good memories that are completely unrelated to the place and have more to do with the people I was with at the time. If someone wealthy and hip was here from out of town looking to party, the Mondrian is one of a handful of hotels I'd suggest. Not so much because of Red Bar, but more because it's conveniently located within stumbling home distance to so many other better bars in Downtown.~~#~0
The first thing I respect about Rula Bula is its ability to attract customers while keeping a low profile. No flashing lights, no 400 pound bouncers with angry stares, and no promotional cards being shoved in my face from down the street.I walked in and liked what I saw. It has an old school feel to it. There was a live band doing some Lady Gaga covers, and it sounded like karaoke. I wasn't impressed, so I ordered my Jameson (reasonably priced) and walked out to the patio.It was a good patio, with a DJ in the corner. It had a different feel to it, and I appreciate how laid back it was. But it felt like something was missing. I waltzed back inside, admired a much better cover (of Micheal Jackson) and realized the one thing I couldn't find here. FUN.To a west-sider like myself, Tempe is the Mecca of mischief, a place where I can have one too many and stumble back home with a story to tell. There was a dance floor, but no one was dancing. There were tons of people, but every group kept to themselves. Even though I don't go to bars to meet women, there was a suspicious lack of pretty ones in here. It's like everyone who was too old or uncool to go elsewhere came to have a Guinness in peace.I came here expecting a fun bar that wasn't a full-blown club, and instead of getting a happy medium I ended up with a boring dive. Don't get me wrong, I fucking LOVE dive bars, but I don't go to Mill Ave for them. Rula is a good place with good history. I can't hate on it. I love the interior, and I could see myself coming back during the day. It's just not worth going out of my way on a Saturday night.~~#~0
The veg burger is fantastic - make sure you ask to try all the different aioli sauces especially with the tots!~~#~0
Chain restaurant that's just about okay for afternoon dining with friends. If I wasn't having beer at lunch I'd probably suggest eating someplace else. Food is good but in my experience their beer makes the meal. I've eaten here about half a dozen times during the past few years when in town for business weekends.It is centrally located on the corner of Mill and Fifth Street in downtown Tempe, amongst quite a few other local restaurants. During my most recent visit I ordered a steak at lunch along with one of the seasonal brewed beers. Steak was okay but I wouldn't order it again. Beer was exceptional, so I wasn't unhappy overall.I love burgers and I think I'll stick to that as my primary choice when eating here in the future. I can't think of any times when service was particularly unsatisfactory, nor were there times when service really stood out as exceptional. I have almost always eaten here on a Saturday afternoon, and it's typically been fairly busy during the lunch hour. Never had a problem getting a table, which is important since I'm usually heading back for an afternoon conference session.I love the big glass beer mugs (not sure what size they are) but I can't always down the whole thing during a short lunch break (I'm a lightweight).Overall, good place to eat if you're hungry and in the downtown area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get here.~~#~0
Wowza!  This place is a total trip!  No, I don't smoke, but if I did this place is probably the place I would go to.  First off, the food was okay.  I ordered some chicken wings, which wasn't really that great.  My favorite was the Thai Curry -- it definitely had some pop to it.  It's one of those that creep up on you.  Milk please!  My friend ordered some Sake that I thought was real good and smooth -- don't ask me what it was, the lighting was low and I didn't care much by the time I arrived.Service was pretty good I guess, and then again the place was drop dead for a Friday night.  What's up with that!?  I'm sure the place gets hopping on 1st Friday, but that's only one day out of the month -- I sure it picks up quick!Ambience, was cool, just reminded me of the 70's in a way even though I didn't grow up during the 70's haha, but I thought the design and decor were pretty cool.  Eccentric I think was the word I used.  Bathroom was blue and that's all I'll say.......check it out! - Enjoy!~~#~0
I went in yesterday for happy hour to have a birthday drink. I had the house margarita for $5.75. Actually I had two! They were good. I think I disappointed the bartender when I question him why his $7.25 Margarita he was pushing was supposedly so awesome. He claimed Cruz a local Tequila was the reason. I argued just because it's local doesn't make it good. LOL. The house Rita stands up alone, as a good traditional Rita on the rocks. Don't buy the hype, as I saw half the crowd not question it and accept the pricier one on special as the way to go. The place was busy. They were also hosting a MBA networking mixer just off the main bar. In addition to discounted beer at happy hour they also offered free food! I thought those days were gone but they kept a steady supply of warm chips, salsa, veggie tray, cold pinwheel wraps and one or two hot Mexican items (mini chimis, and bean & cheese nachos) coming. I was going to order a half price appetizer as part of my happy hour, but heck I went for the free food and was just fine. My sampling of the appetizers makes me wonder how good the menu was, so I peeked at it. It looks pretty basic but tasty. I think everything was $12 or less on the dinner menu. According to the sign outside lunch starts at $5.99.  It may be commercialized Mexican food but it's a step up from some places like Taco Bell and Baja Express for certain.The staff seemed competent and to work rather well together. Even though it was busy the staff was calm and quick to serve, which is a good thing. They seem to recognize some customers as regular patrons which was also nice. The woman's room off the bar was fresh and clean in this madness as was the bar and all areas I could see. I think I will be back. I think I could even become a fan of the place over time. It seems to have a good mix of people and an impressive straight male clientele, worth another look.~~#~0
Wings in Buffalo aren't usually breaded. I can't stand breaded Buffalo wings. The sauces were good, I can't deal with the breading. The redeemer for this place is that they serve Roast Beef on Kimmelweck. I did not try it, I am sure it was decent though.~~#~0
Fine. Just fine. C+/B- average-- all around.    The decor was rustic and lodge-like, yet still open and modern.  No complaints here-- aesthetically pleasing and lacking the bright colors and loud mariachi music of more traditional Mexican restaurants.  The table we were sat at seemed to have been haphazardly wiped-- not totally clean. Our server was okay as well-- friendly enough, but seemed generally disinterested in her job and us and was not very knowledgable about the food she was serving. The food was fine.  The salsa served with the chips was totally fine-- fresh enough but not very flavorful-- a theme we would soon learn would repeat itself throughout our dining experience.  We started with the avocado egg rolls with cilantro honey dipping sauce.  These were the highlight of the meal-- the sweet sauce complimented the creamy avocado taste nicely.  My only qualm here was the $10.50 price tag for 2 standard sized egg rolls.  Seems a wee bit steep for what it was, but still very tasty.  I ordered the vegetarian tacos and they were good-- not wow, but good.  I appreciated the variety of vegetables and the fact that they had veggie tacos in the first place (many more standard Mexican restaurants do not).  I do wish they'd had more spices. The side of rice was pretty good, but not as flavorful as I'd like.  The veggie tacos are also served with some sort of pickled cabbage onion slaw (because the borracho beans that accompany the other dishes are cooked with bacon).  The slaw was also fine.  In general the food was acceptable, but a bit bland.  I should also mention that the portions are quite reasonable-- two smallish veggie tacos and a bit of rice and slaw.  Sometimes the portions as more traditional Mexican restaurants are absurdly gargantuan-- it was nice to see a normal sized and relatively healthy-seeming Mexican(ish) meal.Full disclosure here-- our visit to Black Chile was prompted by a card we'd received in the mail good for $20 off any meal.  So we figured it was worth a shot-- and it was, but maybe not a return visit.  Our bill (pre-discount) for the appetizer, 2 entrees, and two sodas came to $40.  If it wasn't at the Biltmore, I'd say it was a little steep, but considering its location, it's probably right on.  I'd go back if the food had wowed me, especially since it's in my neighborhood, but it didn't, so a repeat visit isn't likely.  There are enough solidly 4 and 5 star places in the vicinity that 3 stars doesn't generally make me a repeat customer.~~#~0
My parents love pho so I've practically been enjoying Vietnamese cuisine since the womb. Ha! No wonder I love it so much myself that it was always on the weekly dinner rotation when I lived in OC. Alas, I moved to North Phoenix and I dont have little pho shops or boba cafes on every street corner. I've learned that I have to drive a ways to Chandler/Mesa to satisfy these cravings. Imagine my surprise when the husband and I noticed Tea Lite Cafe when we changed up our movie theater location this past weekend. Of course, we had to try it out and we'd been dying for some pho for months now.We both ordered the beef pho and took a seat. The place is small but there's plenty of seating and still feels spacious. The cashier up front was super friendly and welcoming which was nice. We didn't have to wait too long for our food to arrive...another plus. The pho itself has really tasty broth and the beef was nice and tender. I was disappointed by the small portion of bean sprouts, mint leaves and limes that accompanied the soup. I'm used to overflowing plates of these veggies so I can load up my soup to my heart's desire. In fact, my hubby usually counts on me doing this since I end up eating all my veggies and leaving most of the beef for him. Double ha! But the lack of sprouts and mint leaves didn't put a damper on the great taste of the pho. What I did miss was the traditional pho ingredients like tripe, rare steak and tendons. I know, I know...sounds intense but trust me it makes pho taste soooo good. I guess I just have a usual when it comes to pho so I was a little disappointed when I couldn't satisfy my craving to the utmost degree. Woe is me. But let me conclude by stating again that the pho here is really good and has a great flavor to the broth. I think the hubby and I will go back since it is so conveniently located to us. It'll definitely do in a pinch although I am sure I will occasionally find myself making the trek to get me some tripe!~~#~0
Pretty good deli sandwich but a hassle for parking. Love the selection of things to buy sorta like a little market in NY!~~#~0
what better way to end a perfect Spring training baseball day than with a marg, Mexican food and your girlfriends...the local in the group said this place would be crowded on a Sat night, so we weren't surprised with the wait time, but if a place is used to being crowded....they should have a better wait plan. if the bar is full (which it was for a bit), there is not much space to hang and wait, once we got to our table, our waitress spaced....got us water and then never came back. i liked the menu, as it spiced up some of the normal Mexican fare...like the shrimp chilaquiles with chipotle cream sauce that was great! the guac is good, but deceiving as it comes out in this huge mound served in a pestle...in actuality, there is a lot of lettuce on bottom then cup of guac. and my house margarita was more tangy mixer than tequila, kinda ick.i think this place has potential and i might try it again if i could do it on a weeknight, but for now it just gets my average.~~#~0
First off, it's fast Chinese, and they lived up to their promise on that one, we did get our dinners fast. I am a huge fried rice fan; and I have to say theirs was horrible, stick to plain white or brown rice. However, I had the beef with broccoli and that was ok. It's not like Beef with broccoli is exploding with flavor anyways, so I can confidently say they didn't mess it up. What I do like about this place (besides how quick our food came out) is that you can do the meal deal , typically only offered at lunch, for dinner which gets you the egg roll and crab puff at dinner. I love crab puffs, again theirs was just ok and I didn't care for the egg roll all that much. Overall it was fast, filled me up with a huge portion that I took home lots of left overs; they were open kind of late - until 10, and it wasn't the worse thing I ever ate. Also, they had very friendly service.~~#~0
As a fairly new connoisseur of Greek food, this place is pretty good. I like their pita a lot, and the fire feta is quite addicting.  The salad and rice aren't anything to write home about, and I'm not crazy about the tzaziki sauce here (love it other places)... the street gyros were decent, and the tea that they serve here is delicious when mixed with pink lemonade. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but I'll be back when I'm in the 'hood.~~#~0
Food is just 'eh... Just one more sushi place of many~~#~0
Food was good. Service was not good. Only one waitress for entire restaurant.~~#~0
This is a pretty chill spot for drinks & bar food.  We went on a Sunday night after a big meeting that was held at the Phoenix Convention Center.  They were able to accommodate a group of about 20 of us without any issues (not a whole lot of people there).  Their quesadillas and curly fries are quite good and I could not help reaching for the nachos again and again, but definitely avoid their Caesar salad (I know, who orders salad at a bar anyway?!)~~#~0
Its been a few weeks since I've eaten here..but its only now that I have time to write this long, overdue review.Hm...its upscale...kind of comparable to Mikuni's in Sac...but their menu is to some extent, smaller and less tasty.  I don't recall exactly what i ordered but...I wouldn't recommend this place to friends.  It was okay, nothing that stood out...and trust me, food, when its good...it sticks with me.  :)  Without further a due, edible but i would never crave for it again.~~#~0
I know this is going to be super girly but I love the peach beer at Four Peaks and the beer battered fries are amazing.~~#~0
I remember a time when Ikea was an almost legendary place where the angels would sing a greeting to me as I passed through the hallowed doors. That was a long time ago. When I was younger (and significantly poorer) Ikea was the one true way I could get semi-stylish home furnishings at a reasonable price. Many a room was filled with fine pre-fab furniture that was always just a wee bit small. It's funny how ones' tastes change. This weekend I ventured forth to Ikea in search of baby stuff. A good friend of mine is with child and wanted to check out what Ikea had to offer. Walking through the store I saw the same stuff I saw ten years ago, and while I could still see the appeal, I realized that it just wasn't as cool as I remembered. Ah well, at least I still have the memories (and the coffee table, end tables, TV stand and lamps). Ikea is still great if you have something specifically in mind. My friend found a bunch of excellent decorations for the soon-to-be-born babies room, all for insanely low prices. I bought a few pillows. Yes, this is what my life has become. Ikea didn't change, I did.~~#~0
Live entertainment, friendly, restroom clean, my dish was good, but my hubbies dish the meat was not seasoned at all and for a fajita they gave him a burrito flour size tortilla and took about 15 mins to bring a second one.  Plus hrs are posted wrong on yelp. States open from 6 am to 2 pm even though they serve breakfast, lunch and dinner.~~#~0
This really amounts to 3.5 stars.  I think after seeing all of the stellar reviews combined with my LOVE for Filipino food, my expectations were just too high.I took a few coworkers with me to check out the food and see if I had finally found a local Filipino eatery to curb my cravings.  Not so much.  The pancit (my favorite Filipino entree) seemed to lack flavor and/or seasoning.  I also wanted more meat and veggies - maybe that's just due to what I'm used to.  It was more just oily noodles and missed that flavor I wanted.  The good news is the pancit is cooked to order so it's very fresh and hot - just be prepared to wait a few minutes.I was also very excited to get some lumpia.  Again, not so much.  They were tiny with some mushed ingredients in them.  Also again, it may be just what I am used to, but I've always had ones which are longer with more fillings - stuff you can actually see and taste what's in them.On a positive note, the folks there are extremely friendly and helpful.  It makes me want to like it even more.  I'll go back and give it another go - I'll give the chicken adobo (my other favorite) a shot for some redemption.A few tips:*If you order pancit, order first because everyone's items are not brought out at once and the rest of your party will be waiting on you.*It is a small place - tough to fit the 5 of us.  There were only a few other tables to seat 2.I really wanted to like you Karey's Kitchen...~~#~0
I don't usually write reviews very often (in fact ever).  But I felt that the 4.5 stars does not currently reflect my previous sushi experience here.  First off, the service here was really good.  The waitress was really nice, very prompt and courteous and provided the food quickly. The food itself, was prepared well, I usually eat a lot of nigiri and the pieces are ok in amount of fish, the rice was packed well and the quality of the fish was good.The major downside in my opinion is that its pricier than I expected.  I wish Yelp would provide "2.5 dollar signs".  Granted, I did not come for "Happy Hour" which ends relatively early at 5pm.  I go to a lot of sushi restaurants and for the amount of fish provided, I would have expected it to be cheaper.Also, the edamame cost $$.  Even the miso soup is not complimentary.  Considering the above average price, I've been to too many other places that have the same price, same quality, and provided the necessities for free.  Oh, I even forgot that a bowl of white rice for my child was even a charge.  So, the nickel and dime of things I would have expected compounded with the surprisingly above average price, I can only say that Yen Sushi was "ok".  The other two people in my party (minus the children) also agree.~~#~0
Honestly, I love cupcakes. Like I said in my Wicked Bakery review, eating a cupcake, unlike a slice of cake, gives one a sense of accomplishment. I like cupcakes. I like the sense of accomplishment you get from eating a cupcake. You may have had a hard day, but you finished an entire cupcake. That's validation. It makes me happy.Sprinkles is a great place to go for a sugar fix, but I have to say there are some negatives. I have had a dry cupcake there. They are a bit on the expensive side.The worst sin of all? Their red velvet is "a southern style light chocolate cake with a cream cheese frosting". I have to disagree. I don't detect any cream cheese flavor in that frosting.The first time I devoured a Sprinkles cupcake it was magical. I was particularly impressed with the black and white- "Belgian dark chocolate with creamy vanilla frosting". I was in a shoebox Los Angeles apartment and the cupcakes seemed of adequate size. The next time was the new location  am currently reviewing and they were consumed in a larger-than-shoebox Chandler house. They seemed a little small. The third time was in my car- a Subaru Baja, and the cupcakes, again seemed sizable. I'd have to think that consuming a Sprinkles cupcake in an SUV would not be a great idea- the cupcake to eating space ratio would be all off. For true cupcake validation, I'll drive the 35.9 miles to Wicked.Ok- you caught me. I might stop by for an emergency fix if I happen to be in the area, but I'll be thinking of Slade at Wicked... and I'll be consuming my confection in a small space.~~#~0
10/12Friendly and quick, although I had to point out a few spots where extra attention was needed (tar on one side was initially observed as paint scratch, until I told them to check it again).  I also found a few spots that could've used another one or two swipes of the towel, and the sunglass case was never touched and thus dirty.  Be sure to visit during the early part of the week, and not on the weekend to grab the best deals- I paid $100 for both interior and exterior detailing.  Am so happy with the overall results- the spots between the bottom of my car seats and the floor are completely clean of caked-on food debris (I am living in the middle of the desert, after all) from a few mishaps throughout the years!~~#~0
Luci's is a good neighborhood spot to buy your health foods, drop in for a coffee or fresh made baked good, or pick up some beer or frozen meat on the way home.  I agree with Pamela's sentiment about it being a marriage of TJ's and Hi-Health with AJ's prices. I've had a couple of bad cups of coffee here, but in the 10-12 times I've been they have always been very nice and have remedied any problem very quickly. If it wasn't on my route, I may not stop here much though. Trader Joe's and Hi-Health are right next door to each other at 20/Camelback and you can save a ton of money if you do it that way!~~#~0
Agree with most posters about the setup - left much to be desired.I was smart and arrived BEFORE 4:00 P.M. so I could jump in early for some short and FAST lines.  My 15-yr-old son was with me, and he's a fairly picky eater, which was one reason I brought him - so he could see that there are other foods he might like if he TRIED them.I got a lot of food between 4:00 and 4:30, when the lines were short.  I probably got to try 10 trucks before we left at 5:07.  We went back to some trucks more than twice or three times when we found something we liked.My advice for future events:1.  Help the trucks deliver the samples FASTER.  Not sure how - maybe get them an extra staff member?  But the samples on some trucks were coming SLOWLY, so that needs to improve.2.  Better location, maybe not on dirt, and maybe a little larger.  Once the lines got up to 20-30 people, the going was CRAMPED and it was taking a long time to get your samples.3.  Maybe a lower price for tickets?  Seemed kinda steep for the amount of food each person received.All in all, I enjoyed the FOOD, but the rest of the logistics, not so much.~~#~0
I have been to this place twice and I have had both extremes.  The Good: Shannon, California Sea Bass, Michelle (Manager's) Customer ServiceThe Bad: Fried Calamari, Our last waiter's breathThe first visit to this establishment was our encounter with Shannon.  Shannon was a pure delight as our waitress.  She made our first visit absolutely fun.  My wife had a tilapia dish that she was less than enamored with but I had the California Sea Bass and that tasted very good.  In fact, it was so good that I regretted not getting a glass of Chardonnay to go with it.  The fish had a very nice texture and taste.Our second visit was our first encounter with the fried calamari.  As our guest so eloquently said, "If this was my first impression of fried calamari, I would not have liked it."  The calamari was overcooked and there was so much oil running on the plate.  We called this issue to Michelle's attention and she agreed 100% that the dish was not prepared properly.  She gave us a coupon to come back there and eat at any time.  However, our waiter's breath was another story. Whenever he spoke, I could smell his pungent (trust me, a lot better than what I really wanted to say) breath to the point I almost donned a gas mask.  There are very few things that would cause me to lose my appetite.  His malodorous breath and the calamari with more grease than a Jiffy Lube accomplished the feat.~~#~0
Monday evening at 5:30p....The streets are empty....we walk into the bar looking for a Happy Hour beer while we wait for a Yelp event to get started a few doors down.   Noticing a couple of people on the sidewalk we expected more people inside....*crickets chirping*  [You'd hear them if it wasn't for a few of the TVs that had their volume turned up.]  The interior was welcoming and clean...but why are we the only ones here...The bartender was rather indifferent and sauntered over like he was wishing he could be somewhere else too.  We had a leisurely beer and tabbed out....I may have to check out this place again if I find myself in the area.~~#~0
When we lived in AZ, my biggest regret was not coming here. I've always wanted to try it.Doing our road tripping this week, I was able to. Parking was easy for a weekday...we went in - through the wrong door. Oops. The server who was stocking things seemed surprised, but rolled with it. She said we could sit anywhere we wanted (we were a party of three). We chose a table for 6 so we could spread out a little and not be so squished. She immediately snapped, "Not that - it's for 6 people." I almost said, "Then don't tell us we can sit wherever we want..." I refrained. That surly girl nearly spoiled it, but luckily our server saved the day.I saw the hot dog...you know, the 22 inch insane monster on the menu. I split it with my friend. We didn't even finish it. It was delicious, if a bit salty. I knew it was a salt overload because in under an hour my fingers were swollen. :( Oh salt, why must I love you yet be so affected by you?We didn't finish it, but definitely enjoyed it. If I get this again when in town, I'll get it plain and still split it with a friend.~~#~0
Dinning here since 2003Wings: Big and flavor full, special wing prices on Monday.             Some of the biggest wings around, includes: celery and ranch or blue cheese.           Four star wings. Pizza:  Delicious!!  A medium is 14" and the crust is thin, and foldable, New                York style... with LOTS OF HOT CHEESE.  Four star pizza.Fried zucchini:  Complete disappointment, for $5.XX ( $5 something)  you receive                            8 small zucchini rounds.  Chicken Tenders:  Dry, small, inadequate. Beer, Pitcher of:  ICE COLD, delicious draft. ************Atmosphere:  Mom n' Pop Shop... this place permeates family owned.  There are                      usually only 2 people working, one in the front and one in the back.                      Definitely the kind of place where you don't want to piss anyone off, and                      they might have a shotgun under the bar...Service: The waitresses are attentive and very close if you need additional service.*************Will I Return?  Yes, I love those wings!!! Ugh... And the pizza, yum.  I just won't                       order appetizers.~~#~0
I would love to give Yoli's a higher rating but there were different factors that occurred that morning.  When we arrived they were closing early and had very little left on their menu as they were reviewed by a local TV station and ran out of food.  That is a good thing they were receiving recognition but not good for someone who was stopping in for the first time.We decided to sit outside on the patio, water began to leak from the roof and you had to move to a different seat.  They blew it off as "oh well", when food arrived, I was not impressed with what they had to offer.  The food had little flavor.  It is hard to give a fair rating because they did not have their popular foods available.  It was disappointing that we paid $ for an average meal. We will try Yoli's again soon, we are hoping it is Wonderful!~~#~0
Place is OK, I'm just not a big fan of what they have to offer! It's funny reading some of the complaints! People get a grip! Food is good, place is a cafe style, so your service is really up to you! Cookies are really good, my wife enjoys their sandwiches.~~#~0
Bacon madness! Huge french toast! Cute little piggies decorating the orange walls!Oink is a friendly, peppy place to go for breakfast. The food is pretty good, the place is happy, all-in-all I would say this is the perfect place to wake up in the morning!The only irksome quality was our server, who seemed very nervous, checked on us at weird times, and said "you're welcome" too often (I didn't know that was possible, but it was). I enjoyed the jalapeno (!) bacon and the oink french toast. The cinnamon rolls were also tasty, but my group was disappointed by the eggs benedict. I would say the food could be better, but it's just awesome to have a local breakfast place somewhere in my neighborhood now!~~#~0
It's like being a Target girl but recognizing the value and prices of Walmart... so I don't make a point to shop here (vs LeeLee's with greater intl variety), but when I am in the area... I frantically think of what is low in the pantry so supplies can be restocked at a minor savings.  The pricing is marginally cheaper -- to clarify, the auto 10% discount is calc off the non-sale items.~~#~0
I do not see why people are so quick to judge an IHOP so harshly.It's an IHOP for Pete's sake. The service is ok for being a chain breakfast place. But it is nice that this location is 24hours because my friends and I need a place to eat whether it be after bar hopping hours or not.The food is consistantly not too bad (again for a chain) and I've gone back several times. Besides, it is great for people watching at certain hours of the day/night! :)~~#~0
Nothing special about this place.  Clean and the food is okay. I go because my one son loves it.  Have to keep the kids happy.  Never had a bad experience but never had anything stand out either.  My fav dish is the Spinach artichoke dip.~~#~0
This bar reminds of an old pair of pants. It fits. Not too tight, not perfect. Just kind of fits. There's some holes in the knees, and its a bit faded. It's certainly not perfect.Mulligans is that bar where you can go and kick it with your friends. You never know what kind of people you are going to run into. Co-workers, drunkards, bottle rats who got kicked out from other places.The drinks are cheap. The beer selection is so so. The bartenders are pretty nice, but aloof. It's just an average bar though. Nothing great, nothing bad.~~#~0
The Phoenix Hooters is directly opposite the Sheraton Downtown hotel where I was staying. Was really hungry and didn't want to eat at the hotel so decided to give hooters a try. Hooters girls are always a nice touch. I really liked this location since there was a lot of outside seating. The food is what you expect from Hooters. I had the pulled pork sandwich with fries. It was good but then I was very hungry. Food quality was good and arrived quickly. Can't ask for anything more!! Hooters girl was also cute!! I would come back with a crowed of guy for a drink and burger. Prices are very reasonable.~~#~0
This place is a hit or miss. Hence why I would rate it as average.  I've been here so many times for lunch because it's so close to work and because coworkers would suggest it.  I've had all the curries and every time the spiciness is different even though I ask for a 3.  Sometimes it's not spicy at all and sometimes it's so spicy that my mouth burns.  I've had the eggplant with chicken, but the chicken isn't as moist and tender as I hoped meat would taste like. They chopped up the chicken in very small pieces and seemed overcooked.  I would stick with the different types of curries (red, green, yellow) though.  It's safer.  The curry sauce would seep into the meat and make it more tender. The curries can also be different textures.  I've had it where it's thick and creamy (the way I like it) or more watered down.  The lunch portions are pretty small, but I guess it's enough for a lunch meal.  Beware Swaddee's if you're not too comfortable with spicy.  Just order a lower number and you can add more chili if it's not spicy enough for you.  I still would recommend this place and try your luck with the food here.  You may get lucky and have a great meal.~~#~0
Outside the treats, you get an adorable and sleek interior which is very comfortable and feels great to be in, and fun people watching to boot. Its a little expensive for the drinks - I figure that comes with the territory.~~#~0
For 6 days out of the week I eat tons of fruits, veggies, nuts, seeds, whole grains, fish, etc. Tuesday afternoons is my cheat meal and I really look forward to it. This time I was looking forward to pizza. I love pizza.We dined on Tuesday afternoon, the place was kinda empty so we got tons of attention from our waitress who was wonderful. For an appetizer we ordered the rock shrimp with garlic, basil aolioli (sp) dipping sauce. The shrimp were okay, but needed a more flavorful dipping sauce maybe a spicy marinara or barbecue. For my meal I decided to go with the soup and 9 inch pizza lunch special: butternut squash & margerita pizza. The soup was actually quite good. The pizza was good, but something was missing. Oh yeah, the CHEESE!!! Seriously, do I have to ask for extra cheese on a pizza? I really look forward to my cheat day and the pizza did not live up to my expectations.For dessert I went with the donut holes drizzled with caramel and sprinkled with powdered sugar. The order is huge, seriously there were no less than 30 donut holes. Cheat day or not it was just too much. My husband ordered 2 scoops of vanilla ice-cream. After visiting a local ice cream shop where everything is homemade, this ice-cream did not come close.Long story short, we will visit again only next time we will ask for extra cheese on a cheese pizza.~~#~0
the food was okay, it's a bit pricey. I liked the big wood boat they served our sushi on. not my favorite but don't hate it either.~~#~0
I'm not feeling the love here. Went to Hillside on the recommendation of a friend that lives nearby and loves the place. I would love it more if it was my local caf. We went on a Sunday morning, knew there would be a crowd but the wait in line wasn't long and we had a table right off.  The entire line stopped while the order taker bagged up the to go portion of my order, my friends pie to go ordered at the same time took over an hour to get to the table. What was that? the food is good the portions large. They can't afford to get a number system for the tables? A wait person stood behind the drinks station/bar bellowing my name. not even stepping around. I had to stand up and holler  because I COULD NOT FIND THE PERSON WHO HAD MY FOOD. The food was nice but living in the east valley I wouldn't drive cross town to eat here again.~~#~0
Sometimes the downside of Yelp is that you read so many great reviews for a new restaurant and you garner these very high expectations. That's what happened with St. Francis anyways. Our bartender was not friendly at all. The dessert was very good however! Hopefully next time the service will be better - sometimes you just catch people on an off night.~~#~0
I can't help but feel the same sentiment as Nathan S. - I sort of feel bad giving this place only 3 stars with all the other rave reviews. Let me start with the positives -  I love love that the place is so small and intimate.  Especially in comparison to most Valley restaurants that are just cavernous.  And with the European-style seating you have to get friendly with your neighbors.  Both of these things make this feel like a good NY restaurant. I also love the atmosphere and decor in general.  Very authentic Spanish, very laid back, not all hip and modern like most restaurants try to be these days. The service was extremely friendly, from the hostess to all of the waiters and waitresses and bus boys that came by. My husband really liked the Sangria (Tinto) - he said it wasn't very strong but tasted great. Indeed, all of the food tasted very good.  Our two favorite dishes happened to be the daily specials - the Eggplant Barcelona and the Turkish Custard dessert.  But the Tortilla Patatas and the Gambas and the Spinach with Garbanzos were all great as well. Now to the negatives -  Firstly, selection was dreadful all around.  The wine list was very minimal, and the very limited bar didn't help.  And there were only about 8 dishes to choose from.  When I go for Tapas, the whole point is having a wide variety of small plates to choose from! Every dish was DROWNED in oil.  Literally, bowls of oil.  The food just sat in my stomach afterwards, and I felt like I needed to take a shower to rid myself of all the grease. The sizes of the dishes were very inconsistent.  I know it's tapas, and I love me some tapas, but generally at tapas places I find you could likely split each dish three ways.  The Gambas and the Spinach were both huge piles that could have been split up to 4 ways.  But then the Tortilla Patatas was barely large enough to split two ways, and then our two favorite dishes - the Eggplant Barcelona and the Turkish Custard - were both smaller than a deck of cards and splitting them just two ways left us each with a single forkful of food.  There was a party of 4 next to us that put in 1 order of the Pork Tenderloin and the waitress said, "You should really get 2 or 3 orders of that so everyone can try some."  3 orders for 4 people to try it?! Then, right along with the food size is the price.  $90 (incl tip) for the 4 tapas mentioned above, plus a glass of sangria, 2 glasses of wine, the dessert, and an espresso.  2 of the tapas were one bite per person.  Yikes. The food, while good, was nothing outstanding.  There was no dish that made me stop and say "wow, now that is well done."  They were solid but not amazing.  (As opposed to the Lomo Embuchado at Cobras y Matadors in LA that I was ready to marry and make babies with).So all in all, I'd say a 3.5 star experience, rounded down because it just wasn't a 4 for me.  I can't help but compare this place to my favorite tapas place in the valley, Sol y Sombra in the DC Ranch, where they have a huge selection of fantastic wine (and a full bar) and a huge selection of delicious and much larger portioned tapas for the same price.~~#~0
Minnie and I stopped by Papago Dog Park today on a whim... It was a beautiful day and since she was such a good girl in the car with me and at my afternoon meeting, I wanted to reward her.  Rather than travel out of our way to go to Chaparral Dog Park (our usual dog park destination), I remembered seeing this place, specifically the fenced in / off-leash area, and we swung by.It was just after 4pm, and there were a handful of dogs there, and more were coming the longer we stayed.  It's a lot smaller than Chaparral, and the grass is not the healthiest I've seen... Unfortunately, there were several areas that owners didn't clean up after their pooches too.  (Come on, owners, you give the rest of us a bad name!)Anyways, we had a nice 30 minute visit... Minnie sniffed out a few other dogs from behind and then they returned the favor to her.  Don't you love how they socialize with each other?!  Too cute.Anyways, will this become our dog park of choice? No.Is this a viable option if you're in the area? 100%.~~#~0
I was way excited to try this restaurant since it's so close to my house.  I just assumed it was one of those places that looked like a dive outside, but served up a piece of heaven inside.  Once I read the Yelp reviews, I was convinced I had made a sound real estate investment!Maybe my expectations/hopes were too high, but I thought it was just ok.   I liked the chips and salsa, and the service was friendly without being in your face.  We ordered a round of margaritas which tasted good, but were really weak in terms of the amount of tequila.  My father had the garlic shrimp and octopus which was really delicious--if I go back this is what I'd order--and I had the fish cuilichi was ok, just kinda heavy and not really something that got me excited.  The girly girl in me says, "not worth the calories!"I think I'll give it another try some time in the future--perhaps it was an off night.~~#~0
This seems like a decent place to get a drink, if youre so inclined, before going thru security. The service was so so, but I also think our waiter was in training. We didnt venture very far into the actual restaurant, just sat at one of the pub tables by the enterance to keep an eye on the security line, so I guess its good for that as well.~~#~0
Sauce has grown on me... particularly this location since this is the one I frequently end up at for a quick lunch or casual dinner spot near home.I typically order chopped salads at lunch.  The chopped turkey & feta salad is what I had today.  I had them add asparagus, which was a great call if I may say so myself!  The large salad and fresh roll is the perfect lunch... fresh, filling, healthy enough, and pretty inexpensive when it comes to designer salads around town.  I also like the spinach, pancetta & goat cheese and the veggie & aged parmesan salads.  My husband eats at Sauce often as well... he goes for a salad or sandwich.  Last time we were there together, he had the salami, turkey, prosciutto & mozzarella panini.  I had a bite and was pleasantly surprised! It had a nice balance of thin sliced meat, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and tangy red wine vinegar in between two perfectly grilled pieces of bread.  The thin crust pizzas are pretty decent also.  Depending on your appetite, sharing a pizza and a salad with your companion can work out to be a satisfactory meal... What I like about Sauce the most? Fast, friendly, and efficient service in a clean and casual environment.  The moderate pricing is also a big plus in my book... especially in this economy.~~#~0
This place is your standard hole in the wall pho. They've got good tasting pho and spring rolls for cheap. :D The cleanliness is definitely lacking but more flavor fo' yo' noodlee!~~#~0
U.S. Egg is situated directly across the street from Denny's.  A nicer and classier environment than Denny's but the quality of food is similar (well, slightly better) and a bit pricier.  Service here was really friendly however.Ordered the Triple Play (pancakes, eggs, and bacon) but substituted the regular pancakes with their famous protein pancakes which are packed with oatmeal, blueberries and cinnamon.  Bacon and eggs are always good, tough to mess those up.  The protein pancakes had a nice flavor, but the oatmeal which is mixed within the batter before they are poured on to the griddle actually messes with fluffy texture that I enjoy whenever I eat pancakes.If you are really big on breakfast and brunch food and don't want to eat at a nationwide chain restaurant it may be worth it to check this place out, just temper your expectations on the protein pancakes.~~#~0
You know when you make a copy of the original and its not quite the same? Juts a little fuzzy around the edges, not as sharp but usable? That is how I felt at the new location of Market Bistro. Similar vibe that I enjoy at the original isn't quite as pulled together at this location. Maybe the lack of a lounging area or the weird particle board chic tables? Or the fact that every table was dirty except one by the blast furnace (front entrance).. maybe the grease dripping on the glass in front of the grill? No forks? I'm sorry if I sound like a banging on MB.. but these are things that can be improved on. The Mr and I shared a salad and a Cuban sandwich.. the control freak in me of course got off on the salad making.. this was probably the best salad Ive made to date.. you should be able to patent your creations! The Cuban sandwich was okay.. the ciabatta rolls are so thick and chewy that when you take a bite the toppings sort of fire out the back.. for a Cuban sandwich I think it had some sort of Asian spice, like cardemom?? Anyway, the Mr didn't like it at all. This being his first time he was confused as to why I went on and on until he took a bite of my patent pending salad, then it all made sense to him. The salads are just so complete and delicious!I look forward to coming again.. I just hope that they can make a perfect copy of the original or go for a different feel entirely.~~#~0
Oh, True Food. I want to love you.But you make me feel like I'm eating in a cafeteria. WIth such a contemporary menu and a staff full of bright shiny faces this restaurant is just a contradiction in form... the menu and ambience just don't match.My advice is to sit at the bar. The drinks are well served by pleasant bartenders and do their job, the stools are comfortable, and from that locale you get to skip the experience of having dinner with a room full of strangers right at your elbow.~~#~0
went midweek and were seated right awayTable was clean, service was adequate but food, meh.Hasbrowns barely cooked and no flavor and the famous biscuits were more like mini loaves of bread with no biscuit consistency and the gravy was honestly just blah.  After hearing such rave reviews I had to try it once but don't need to go back.  Kinda sad because I love breakfast.~~#~0
I really want to gives this Sprout's location 4 stars but over the past few months when I get a deli sandwich the bread has bean stale 1 out of 3 times I'm there so I can't do it. If this Sprout's can consistently not give me stale bread I'd be happy.On to the rest of the store....Sprout's is a great farmer's market with a great selection of produce as well as great meats, seafood and cheeses.~~#~0
Had breakfast at Joe's Diner this morning.  I had the number 2, and a side of potatoes.  It was supposed to come with 2 bacon and 2 sausage, but for some reason, mine came with four pieces of bacon.  I didn't question it because the waitress seemed a little absent minded and we had to ask for a side that she had already forgotten.  The few times she came to check on us, she would ask if everything was ok and would walk away so fast that we couldn't tell her what we needed.  The positive here is that the pancakes were REALLY tasty.   I would have given Joe's 4 stars if the service was better, but I think there could be some improvement there.~~#~0
Not a bad place.... It is defiantly more tex-mex than authentic... but they have Mexican beer, margaritas and is in a good location.~~#~0
Finding this quaint location wasn't to hard... i like that there is a parking lot right north of the place... as well as street parking :) you walk in the place and wow... its a completely different atmosphere... low lighting but in a calming way rather than creepy... they have a DJ.. the music makes the setting but to be honest it was a little odd for my taste,,, Our waitress was very nice and helpful... automatically served us cucumber water... (which tastes amazing!!) and then asked for our drink orders ... a good waitress can seriously turn everything upside down or completely make your visit ya know... its a pet peeve of mine.. customer service... every table had a pink candle lit... pink lights hung above the chefs area... it was just so relaxing! the mirrors on the wall around this cool looking splatter painting... i was diggin it... everything on their menu is served as appetizers... which kinda sucks.. they are all at least 6-12 bucks at least ... from what i saw.. and the waitress said that they recommend for people to get at least 2-3 a piece.... wow, on top of drinks.. its kinda pricey to me.. good thing we shared everything... the lemongrass chicken (cant remember the full title) was amazing!! so good... the gyozo (dumplings) were alright.. a little too minty for my taste... we had this other thing where they bring you the hot stone and you cook your own meat... it was alright but the stone only stayed hot enough to cook the meat med rare... i don't like my meat to moo at me... so its was alright... but i prefer it well done... the beef wrapped in grape leaves.. well i was soo excited to try them.. but was sadly disappointed... they were so fiery hot (spicy) that i almost had tears in my eyes... never did it say on the menu .. SPICY... after a server came over and saw us gasping for water.. he filled us up and said, oh yea those are pretty spicy... wow good thing i had my TUMS lol over all The atmosphere was amazing..... the staff was fabulous... the food... eh... the menu is crap... if your gonna serve spicy food you should say its spicy! isn't that some sort of health hazard?! and its kinda on the pricey side... i think i would go back again... But i don't think i would opt to... there are alot more dishes i would like to try... maybe a different location would be better?~~#~0
The pizza's OK, not anything to write home about.  I sat on the outdoor patio, which is on the main street, so while entertaining to watch all the people go by (and there's a wide variety), if you're table's right along the outside edge of the patio (which I wasn't), you may end up interacting with the transients coming by.  So, I got to observe everyone going by without having to interact with them, which was just fine by me, because I do like to people watch.~~#~0
I'm always on the lookout for cool places to bring out of town friends and this place seemed to fit the bill.  It's a sustainable farm that produces Arizona's only extra virgin olive oil.  I came in for lunch and as I pulled into the GRAVEL parking lot my stomach turned because I had expensive heels on and knew they were going to take a beating (I know, "waaah" right? But there are women out there that love their shoes as much as I do and will appreciate the heads-up).  Once I entered the Olive Mill I was delighted to see how adorably quaint it was inside.  The building was split in two, market on one side, bistro on the other with seating in between both and also outside.  The market had testers of all their products, great idea but the food testers didn't seem sanitary so I didn't try anything.  I ended up buying some awesome hand balm that I love.  They had a really great wine selection as well.  Alright so here's the bad part.  The entire time I was there, not one employee greeted me or cracked a smile.   There was one guy in particular that was going back and forth stocking shelves and was visibly annoyed by my presence.  When I went to order my sandwich, I remembered I got a free drink with my Yelp check-in.  The girl at the counter sighed and rolled her eyes as I scrambled through my purse to find my iphone and she said "forget it, I got it."  Their sandwich the "Kalamata" had its 15 seconds of fame on the food network so I was going to get that but opted for the "Lucca" at the last second because it has brie...I love brie more than I love most family members.  The sandwich was a disappointment.  All the ingredients were there but it was devoid of any flavor and I couldn't figure out why.  I probably won't be bringing any of my homies here but I will drop by to buy products, I fully support local businesses.~~#~0
After living 2 blocks away for over a year, i finally took the jump and decided to deal with the long wait to try this place out.  Got there at 7:30 on a Tuesday night... 2.5 hour wait.  (To be expected, but still pretty ridiculous.)  Went next door to Bar Bianco, ordered a bottle of wine and patiently waited outside.  I think that the wait is part of the allure for people.  Also, after waiting hungry for 3 hours, the food becomes tastier because you are starving.  Finally get a table at 10:15.  Order the caprese salad and another bottle of wine.  The ingredients are very fresh.  The Mozz is excellent, the tomatoes are very very fresh and tasty and the basil was great as well.  The server didnt make any recommendations on wine or food.  A bit odd.  Given that the wait is 3 hours and that it's pricy for a pizza joint, you'd think that the service would be excellent.  Not at all the case.  This guy acts like everyone here is a regular.  The reality is that with 3 hour waits for a table, i don't have time to be a regular at this place. We ordered 2 pizzas to try.... Biancoverde and Wiseguy.  They were pretty good, again with good ingredients.  I wouldn't say it was the best pizza i've ever had, but very tasty.  Asked for some Balsamic to go with the Mozz and Tomatoes... had to ask the server 2 times, finally we snagged a food runner, she got it for us.  I shouldnt have to ask for something 3 times. I mean really, this place only has like 6 tables... pay attention to the guests.  I guess the moral here is that trying this place is all about the experience and saying that you've been there.  While Bianco is good you can go to Parlor or Cibo and get very good (comparable) pizza without a 3 hour wait.  Is it good, yes. Is it worth the wait, nope.~~#~0
The person before me reviewed Phoenix Greyhound Park as a Flea Market. I....will be reviewing the Greyhound Park in Dog Race form. We came here during 4th of July night, after many drinks and BBQ-ing and swimming at my relatives home. Prior to leaving to come here, it sounded like a good idea - I was comparing the dog races to the Del Mar horse races in San Diego in my head.But, during the drive, I started feeling wary. This is Arizona, and they're racing dogs in 110 degree heat? What is the constant tugging at my heartstrings? This guilt isn't working for me. The track is outdoor, while the patrons betting on these beautiful animals sit indoor in stadium seating, behind huge glass windows, watching giddily while drinking beer and eating snack bar-type foods. Admission is free. They do keep the dogs indoor before racing them. I decided I'd relent and bet on a race, then immediately felt like an asshole when they brought the dogs around for the camera and I saw them dressed in numbered garb and muzzles. I lost, but I didn't bet for the rest of the races we stayed for, it just didn't feel right.Everyone else had a good time, though, especially the winners. How can I get so excited about the horse races but not the dog races? I'm a walking contradiction.~~#~0
I like to call this "My Basha's".    On the positive side, the selection of wine and beers is pretty extensive, the produce is fresh with quite a few organic choices.  The natural foods section has a number of pleasant surprises and they've added some new bulk dispensers there as well.  I've had mixed experiences getting help in the meat section but the checkout up front is always quick, much faster than some of the other grocery store chains out there.~~#~0
This is a quick grab some decent food kind of place.. this is not by any stretch 'THE' place to go for Thai-  It's best for lunch specials... expensive-ish for dinner for what it is.  It's fine.  We go for lunch because they are AMAZINGLY fast (insert premade everything), but when we get tired of the same 'ol same 'ol we head to Thai Hut.  We have had some instances of meals being too hot/spicy for our table, so be sure you mean spicy when you order a spicy dish.~~#~0
Decent gelato.  Some real, some artificial flavors.Comparable to Gelato Spot, I guess.Nowhere near the same league as Arlecchino, though. However, any place that doesn't use 100% real fruit, chocolate, etc... will never compare to Arlecchino.If you're already at Tempe Marketplace, MDG serves the purpose.~~#~0
Durant's has that old, musty, dark, Mafia feel. Love the atmosphere and allure. We mainly sit at the bar, but have dined in. The happy hour specials are good, and we have tossed a few back here having great talks and enjoying the ambiance.Now for the bad: The food is overpriced for it's quality. The steaks look fatty, the salads wilted, and flavor pretty bland. It would probably be okay if we weren't looking at 20 plus dollars per entree. Back in the day, Durant's was very high end and elite, so I could see the pricing from that perspective. However, if they want to stay in the game, they need to keep the food up to par as well. 5 stars plus for ambiance, relaxation, a throw back feel, and great drinks! 1 star for food and food prices. However, a major landmark in Phoenix, so please check it out! We never know how long these staples will be around. I would just recommend going for drinks and maybe split an appetizer. It does ignite the "romantic mood" and will leave you reflecting on those "good old days".~~#~0
I'm happy to report these cows gave their best for me to eat. Thank you dear moo cows thank you! These burgers are meaty goodness. Recently I went to a lunch with my bf, her sis and Ma on the fly for her b/day since her first choice failed to be open on a Sunday afternoon..... Not her fault their site said they would be open. Bastards shaking my fist in the air didn't update the site. D O U B L E Grrrrr! I suggested Zin since we were in the proximity. So this is my 3rd time at this place. While pricey the portions of everything are large in charge & good. The ingredients are fresh, the meat juicy and the fries are crispy as they should be in my opinion. Note to your mother! Do not waste the fat & gym time on the creme brulee shake. It's nothing more then a fancy name on a regular old vanilla shake. Having said that... I am a creme brulee fan so that may have been it's downfall. I was expecting greatness and fireworks etc. I got a really good vanilla shake though don't get me wrong but name it a vanilla shake. Don't market it as a creme brulee shake. How to improve it and bring a tear to my eye? Put a creme brulee hat on it. Gimmie the crunchy, sweet I'm looking for expect and demand. Just put something on it to give it with that brulee feel or name it a vanilla shake. The best way to explain my feelings would be to say it was like setting up a date with someone on-line and having them show up and it's clear they are photogenic but possibly altered a bit and not the hottie in the pics on their profile. It is some one with a great personality and decent looks for sure just not the hottie. Still had a good time but my expectations were something else totally. The banana cream pie shake is de-lish and the Zin burger a def go. If you want a healthy choice go for the Tuna also very good and served perfectly rare. Mmmmm mmmm good.~~#~0
I have some issues with this place, but you can't avoid BRU when you are having a baby. It's got convenience, selection, and price going for it. We set up a baby registry here mainly out of convenience. It was fine, but I started noticing that they'd randomly discontinue items from the registry and about a week or two later put them back on. They aren't always the cheapest, but when you are strapped for time, trolling the Internet for deals isn't going to happen, and this is where BRU scores. They know they can get you when you are harried and need whatever.The bathrooms are grody here. After being pregnant, I've seen a lot of bathrooms. It seems like a store catering to pregnant women, new moms, etc. would have nicer bathrooms because the likelihood is that we'll use them 9 times in a hour trip. Staff is generally friendly, and the store is well organized.  Selection in store is good.~~#~0
Hit up this joint a couple times while in town for Padres spring training the past several years .. it's great sports-theme hangout for large groups .. plenty of TVs, service is very good, food is decent, big variety of drinks .. but it can get a bit pricey here for a casual place.Location is convenient for those hanging out in the franchise capital of the world--Peoria.~~#~0
clean store, good parking - decent prices too with the gas points savings is a nice bonus.~~#~0
Growing up near this little hole in the wall, this place was a constant stop for my family. It's really good, greasy chinese food that basically tastes like you would expect it to. Now that I live farther away I still have cravings for their delicious orange chicken and chicken fried rice. If you're nearby during lunch try out a lunch special, really great prices!~~#~0
It serves the purpose.  That's about it.Raging Waters it is not. A smaller water park attached to a mini golf course it is.Slides are fun. Night splash is great--no sun, bearable temperatures and no sun burn. I definitely would never go during the day. I couldn't imagine standing in line for 1 hour+ with no shade, 110+ temps and broken misters (I didn't see a functioning mister in the entire park). Park could use a bit maintenance. Staff could use a bit of training.  Lines were very disorganized. Staff didn't have much of a clue as to what was going on. Ex:  spent our last 45 minutes waiting for the wave pool, getting into the wave pool and waiting about 15-20 minutes only for the wave pool to never come on and for the park to close.  Losing almost a full hour out of the 4 that night splash is open was a bit disappointing.I'd probably still return.  But only because there's nothing better in the valley.~~#~0
The actual bar (especially the outdoor area) is really pleasant in the cooler months.  That being said its also near the university so can be overcrowded with snotty hipsters at times.  A good place to socialize with reasonable prices, and oysters, yum.~~#~0
I don't know what Bar Smith is trying to be. I feel like instead of just saying okay we are going to be a X music club on Saturday night they decided to try and appease too many people. 90s R&B and Hip hop on the first floor Techno Electronica on the roof top bar. oooooKAY.I visited the during the 4th Annual Pub crawl at 11:30 at night the place was still pretty empty. Drinks-MehCrowd-Meh, I am still trying to find the young professional males in this area.Layout- I like itBouncers-Really big and Super nice but then again I smiled a lot and didn't give them a hard time about my ID. The last 2 is what gives it the A-Okay and not a full out Meh. I could see throwing a party there, people love dancing outside and on rooftops. This has both and the first floor DJ was decent, all things considered. I will give this place another chance. Maybe it can redeem itself up to 4 stars.~~#~0
Tooooooo crowded!!That takes all the fun of the place. As a mountain is a nice place to go up without feeling that you will loose your lungs. Going down feels faster than up. Being in regular shape it took us about 50 minutes to go up. A moderate hike and doable by all the family.~~#~0
It is a cute little restaurant, has a nice wine list.  I ordered the Linguine with clam Sauce, and a glass of pino.  Personally i think the food is actually pretty good, nice northern italian.  But the service was just ok.~~#~0
I really want to rate the place higher. I like what it's all about. Instead of pulling the building down and rebuilding something in that space, it has been converted to a community space.   I went to see one of their cult classics, and the staff was ok. It was completely amateur hour - I guess that's ok for the type of movie, etc. The problem was this was a sold out movie, and the staff brought in folding chairs to sit on to watch - that would have been ok before the movie started, but ithey did it one at a time making noise for the first 30 minutes of the movie - clanging, whispering, etc. Then they kept getting up and down.  They seating was pretty bad. Low seats that reclined - normally that's ok, but there's usually some spring to it. These had no support at all. Halfway through my back was hurting and would have to readjust - but there was no comfortable way to sit in the chairs.~~#~0
Hmm-Didn't love it, didn't hate it. I was indifferent.I like the decor and if I could give it a half a star just for having an outdoor dining area, I would.The menu left a lot to be desired for me. We went at lunch time so I don't know what the dinner menu looks like.It was just ok. Nothing blew me away. It's nice for people watching and has a really nice location.~~#~0
We tried this place after reading most of the reviews.  I had rice noodle soup w/ fishballs, squid, shrimp & veggies and hubby had shredded pork sandwich.   Both were good and plenty of food.  The pork sandwich was so cheap, it was hard to believe it wasn't a typo.  Beats a Subway anyday!  The neighborhood is a bit shady but if you don't mind that, it is fine.  Service was quick and we will definitely revisit this place.  People kept pouring in during the dinner hours.  Can't beat the price!~~#~0
I was disappointed too.  I waited an hour and then took at seat at the counter which is ok with me, but if you've got long legs your only option is to sit spread-eagled in order to get close enough to your plate and there's not that much legroom to each side.  In the small space in front of the counter the staff was in perpetual motion squeezing past each other to get drinks, etc.   My cheddar, jalepeno, sausage omelette was very good, but not huge, and the hash browns were crisp and tasty on the outside but soggy on the inside.  The whole wheat toast was great, but no choice of toppings...I was given a small dollop of peach preserves. The waffles next to me looked fabulous, but I'm not a fan.   Basically I didn't think it wasn't worth the hour wait in 100 degrees and I was relieved to get outside where there was some breathing room.~~#~0
Pretty nice sports bar. A lot of nice tvs. Food is typical sports bar food with a few exceptional choices. Would stop by again if I was in the area.~~#~0
There are definitely better places to go to in Old Town. Overall Martini Ranch is usually pretty slow and charge a cover to get into an empty place. Last time I went there my friend and I got our cover back because it was so dead. They do have good martinis though.~~#~0
Would have been 4 stats based on prior visit. This past visit the service was just garbage. Not the servers fault, she should have never been on the floor in the first place. Pretty annoyed that she had to ask other servers for assistance while taking our order. What's the soup? I don't know, Jim what's the soup? Is there cheese on the French dip. I don't know? Karen is there cheese on the French dip? The food has always been great and we will be back. Hopefully I can give them 4 stars next visit? Oh yeah, love the.new location!~~#~0
Ok... So I am a sucker for a great breakfast joint that isn't some huge national chain.  Maybe it's the fact that orange county seriously lacks many good breakfast joint option.  Secondly, the fact that they have dog friendly patio service elevates the place in my book.Our trips to Scottsdale aren't complete until we make a stop here for breakfast.  The portions are huge!  The surprising part is that the food is good, which is not usually the case with places with places that do large portions (usually hoping that size covers up the taste).With their Mexican options such as the breakfast burrito or huevos ranchero... They knock the cover off the ball.  The green chil pork in the huevos rancheros is fantastic and keeps me coming back for it.~~#~0
Good vibe - and outstanding location - they definitely work well with a large group (10), delivering orders to the right person without asking "who gets ..."  LOVE THAT KIND OF SERVICE.  And not once, NOT ONCE, did the service people call any of our group "guys" (okay, okay, a pet peeve of mine).  Horseradish potatoes are a bit salty -- and prime rib serving is definitely less than generous.  That said -- the fish and chips were great, as were (according to one of our party) the pork and beans.  Desserts are HUGE -- share with 2 or 3 others.~~#~0
This place isn't bad. The place is pretty big in size and I love that they have a drive-thru. I like coming here on the weekends, especially when I need to study, particularly in the vault. Some times they have live music, which can be good or bad, depending on if you're there to study or hang out. They have decent coffee, not the best, but not awful. And I'd prefer to go here over Starbucks any day.~~#~0
The hubs and I stroll through the indoor market when we are down at the farmer's market on the weekends.  They seem to have a good assortment of items, though the prices are quite high.  But I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt because they are a local business.  One morning we were at the farmer's market and decided to grab something for breakfast - its never a good idea to shop hungry :).  I got in line for coffee while the hubs ordered breakfast.  The coffee is fabulous!  I like my food simple - so when the hubs came back with an egg and cheese I wasn't looking for anything fancy (eggs, cheese, maybe a little butter, salt and pepper on some sort of bread product).  I quickly found out that this was some sort of a hipster egg and cheese. Lettuce on an egg and cheese?  Who does that?  There were also tomatoes, mustard and assorted spices.  I'm willing to admit that maybe its just me and my underdeveloped "simple" palette.  So if you are a hipster and you're hankering for an egg and cheese - this is your place. Regardless, be sure to get a cup of coffee, its awesome!~~#~0
My sweet tooth was yelling at me! I had to stop in. Four times (to date) and each time I try something different. Other than the cheese curds (which where just ok) each visit was for the frozen custard. VERY RICH and CREAMY a little goes a LOOOOONG way. I have tried a small berry sundae, a pineapple malt, and a small black cherry cheesecake concrete mixer. The sundae by far has been my favorite. I love the simplicity, the berries were not overly sweet, strangely artificially thickened. The malt was nice and malty which I really appreciated and was rather thick even after melting slightly. Now the concrete mixer was the richest of the rich. Maybe it was because I decided to go with a cheesecake flavor (to which you can add any other fruit or topping flavor). It was very tart like cream cheese (about as tart as a good Greek yogurt) with small bits of graham crumbs swirled through and of course the blackberry flavor.~~#~0
I went to Pei Wei last night for a casual girls' night dinner.  It was a perfect place for a group of girls to meet because of the following:-it's cheap-it's fast casual so each person pays their own bill and then sits down (no stress when the bill comes as is often the case with groups)-there is plenty to choose from on the menu-for those that are picky or dieting, they are great about special orders, sauce on the side, etc...That being said, Pei Wei is just average in my eyes; never my first choice of places to go, but I can always find something to eat... Last night I had the shrimp teriyaki bowl with brown rice.  The shrimp tasted like it came from the freezer (probably because it did), but the veggies, rice, and sauce were all pretty good.  I noticed they changed the menu a bit since my last visit, and a new 'special' is a Vietnamese Noodle Bowl - Pho type dish.  The chicken lettuce wraps and edamame are always safe bets and hopefully will remain on their menu forever.I'm sure I'll be back to Pei Wei because of the positive factors listed above - the concept is a good one, just don't compare it to a high end restaurant and enjoy it for what it is!PS - shout out to all the girls that came out last night - I had fun seeing all of you and can't wait for the next one!~~#~0
Great great happy hour! Fun atmosphere! Great decor and best garlic edamame in the valley!~~#~0
Old Town Scottsdale has a personality disorder. It tries to be one thing during the day and another at night. Merchants are gouged for hellish fees in order to provide the "free" parking so prices reflect this big gouge as some have to make up six figures per year (no joke). During the day Old Town caters to the typical tourists with skin that hasn't seen the sun since Eisenhower was president. The little shops sell a combination of crap and genuine goods. Restaurants cater to the over 60 crowd for lunch and the idea is to keep people milling around until they have spent all of their money. The perimeter of Old Town is alive with baseball, a hospital, banks and other real world establishments. At night the "clubs" open and each one thinks it's the Viper Room or the Abbey. Sorry, this isn't LA. High cover charges for lame, watered drinks and dead ambiance won't cut it. They make up for being dull with loud music. The rooftop bar concept seems to be dying off after locals who can't sleep through the racket take a few shots at the places from time to time. I can't blame them. A mile away the noise from these places is still thumping loud. It must be horrific to be at one of those rooftop bars. But to be fair, Arizona is not known for night life. It's a place where the sidewalks are rolled up at dusk and they try to cash in on big events like the occasional Super Bowl. They also try to create a night scene Studio 54 style with a new "hot"place popping up and when it is no longer trendy, they change the name and it becomes something else. Restaurants in Old Town also change names in the summer in hope of fleecing the same crowd the next tourist season. Many are now corporate-owned and the local restaurants have had no choice but to follow the downward spiral. On the up-side, look for the local bars and by that I don't mean clubs. The bars such as the Blue Moose are locally owned and serve up good food at decent prices, good drinks and offer friendly service. Stay away from the $30 per entree places and just go cheap and have a good time. If you are the sort who likes to drop $15 on a well drink with a bunch of plastic people who are keeping up appearances with the last of their Visa credit line, AZ88 is the place to go. :)~~#~0
If it would be closer to my area, I could give it one more star. Their special of $4 burgers is a good way to call your attention. The best was the service, the lady that took care of us was really friendly and nice. Another time I'll have to try their food.~~#~0
Not terrible.  I got the drunken noodles and pad thai.  Not the best, but not the worst.  Maybe I'll try them again and update my review...~~#~0
My boyfriend and I had heard about the great food and romantic ambiance of Coup des Tartes so we decided to check it out.  Overall it was fine but we didn't think it lived up to the hype.We knew ahead of time that it was BYOB but decided to forgo bringing alcohol because of the corking fees.  No biggie.  We enjoyed the lemonade and minted iced tea they served us.  We weren't hungry enough for appetizers, so we just ordered salads and entrees.  The salads came out quickly and did not disappoint.  I ordered the Springtime Salad ($10) and absolutely loved it.  Mixed greens with organic apples, red onions, dried cranberries, chevre, and candied walnuts with apple cider vinaigrette.  They put just the right amount of dressing on it so it was coated but not drenched.  My boyfriend ordered the Parmigiano ($9) and said it was very good as well.  It was your basic Caesar salad with homemade dressing.  Both salads were surprisingly large and could have satisfied us for dinner if we had ordered appetizers as well. Then came the entrees.  Well, sort of.  We sat there until we started to wonder if they were out hunting for our food.  Then we thought maybe we should have ordered an appetizer after all to close the gap a little between the salads and the entrees.  But really, why should we have to pay for something we weren't hungry for just so they can get their pacing right? Anyhow, the entrees eventually came.  I ordered the Lambshank ($24) and my boyfriend ordered the Pork ($26).  The lamb fell right off the bone and I didn't even have to use my knife!  It came with a side of Israeli couscous, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  My only complaint about this dish would be the sauce.  It was a harissa spiced vegetable ragout with dried fruits.  For some reason I was expecting something a little thicker.  I felt like the lambshank was sitting in a soup.  Actually, this sauce DID taste like a vegetable stew my mom used to make when I was little that I didn't like.  It was a little bit of a turnoff to me, but not their fault I guess.  (How were they to know?)  I ate it anyway because the meat was cooked so well.  My boyfriend's pork tenderloin was also cooked very well.  It sat atop a bed of risotto and also came with asparagus.  I tried a bite of it, but my dish was so flavorful that it tasted bland in comparison so I can't give it a fair review.  He said it was excellent and finished every last bite on the plate, so I'll take his word for it. The service was....ok.  It was fine in the beginning but while they were out hunting for our food between the salads and entrees we were completely neglected and left thirsty.  After we got our entrees it picked up again and was fine until we left.     The ambiance?  Quaint and pretty, yes.  But quaint does not necessarily equal romantic in my book.  We were seated in a small table jammed into the corner.  The size of the table was fine for two people, but it was way too close to the table next to us which had a party of four seated at it.  Every time someone got up from it to go to the restroom, their backs were right in my face.  We had a nice view of the patio out the window right next to us.  That was until another couple was seated right on the other side of the glass.  My boyfriend felt very uncomfortable for half of our meal because he felt like he couldn't look to his right or else he'd be looking straight at the guy sitting inches away from him.  I was lucky enough to have been seated right next to the wall so I had the view with a little bit of privacy.  The room could have also benefited from some white noise in the background because we could hear everyone's conversations and felt like we couldn't talk at a normal volume without other people hearing.  There was some very soft music playing in the background but it could have been turned up a notch or two.In a nutshell, I'd give the food four stars but the ambiance and service two and a half stars.  I'd go there again to give something else on the menu another try, but I'd request a table on the patio to get out of that cramped little house.~~#~0
Their salad bar here is lacking. I used to go to Whole Foods when I was too lazy to make anything to eat, but didn't want to be riddled with guilt about eating out. The people who work here are friendly and they have a huge selection of canned veggies for salads, as well as other specialty items that may be harder to find out here.They also carry the largest selection of Amy's Organic frozen foods that I adore. mmmmm tofu pockets...~~#~0
This really is more of a lady's hardware store with more design/decorating stuff, small appliances, and such. But this time they had something HD didn't, and at a good price.  Almost exactly what I was looking for, too.Even if you're a die-hard HD shopper, it doesn't hurt to check here too.~~#~0
leave it to corporate america to capitalize on a great idea (ipic) and roll it out, steamrolling everyone in the way...--book your seat in advance using the website (fandango's mobile site integration not working at the time of this review)I LOVE LOVE LOVE knowing that my seat is MINE, and if it isn't available, i'll just have to look for another showing--choose from either the exclusive cinema suites (think first class airline seat, and then some), or the more standard and rowdy "fork and screen"--efficient and hardworking servers and food runners.--the concept is excellent, but with declining food quality, it could die off quickly. why would i pay $8 for a (cracked) plastic bowl of popcorn? goddamit!#chicken wings gone south. they're the fatty and mushy "pump-me-full-of-antibiotics-while-i-stand-in-my-own-shit-while-the-steroids-grow-me-bigger-than-my-body-was-ever-going-to-grow-in-90-days-fee-lot-meat" SHIT "chicken"#that means they're cutting other corners too... yikes.#food often arrives "dead" cold. SEND IT BACK.#be careful to be specific when ordering; many items are similar and your server will assume.#effect of dining while you watch has literally put all the nearby restaurants out of business. the esplanade is a ghost townnote to lessees: always put a clause in your contract that competitors in the same property must be approed by you!HINT: push the service button between your seats as soon as you arrive, even if the server stops by to say he'll be right with you. the button starts a timer which sends an "all call" if someone doesn't reach you quickly.~~#~0
As I write this, I'm waiting for the toilet in the room above me to stop refilling, and the man to the upper left of me to stop his muffled, out of key singing.That puts me in a weird head space, review wise. While this hotel is only three years old, it sounds like it may as well have been built in the 70's. I hear all the conversations of the folks in the hallway, I hear people walking down the hallway above mine, and for the past two days, the heavy footsteps of the person above me woke me up well before my alarm. Normally I'm pretty lenient about things like that but, c'mon. This is a roadside haven meant for business travelers (and tourists too stupid to see that this hotel is near NOTHING you're trying to visit Arizona for) to get some damned shut eye. It's a little tough under the current conditions.Aside from, you know, sleeping. The rest of this Courtyard is pretty nice. The interior and amenities vastly make up for the absolute desolation outside. It's located off 91st, just north of the 10 freeway. There's a little patch of desert and an ITT Technical Institute across the parking lot that seems too small to handle the amount of folks who need to park.Anyway, back to the inside. This is a newer Courtyard. Marriott is drastically trying to get its old chains into a modernization fit to compete with Hilton and Hyatt's business lines. This renovation, (or new construction in this case) includes adding a "restaurant" for breakfast and dinner. And a bar across the way open from 5pm-10pm. Thank God for these two additions because the pickin's around the hotel are slim as a Calvin Klein model. I think there's a Chipotle around the corner. I didn't see you jump for joy. What, not impressed?The rooms are the modern Courtyard style with LG flat screens, fancy shampoos, interesting art on the walls, wired and wireless internet...etc. This location has low tile showers with glass doors. Fancy. I'm used to the sliding curtain that ends up soaking the floor because it's all cloth anyway.If they could get the sound issues fixed (lucky me, I'm on the side of the hotel NOT facing the freeway) I'd easily give another star. Proximity to anything worthwhile is pretty bad, but the point of this hotel appears to be for housing workers in the local warehouses nearby. There's plenty of regulars here week after week after week as the bartender told me a few nights ago.One definite draw is that their weight room is pretty top notch and, of course, dead. You can easily be the only one in there night after night while folks who really need to use a gym will walk by you with minds set on beers, staring into the window as if to ask why anyone would try to work off the food they eat. Hmmm... I wonder. The interior of this Courtyard vastly makes up for the desolation~~#~0
Yes I am writing a review about Red Lobster, don't judge me!! You all know you love those little cheddar biscuits more then life itself! Seriously, Those biscuits, good lord! Hubs and I went here last night, his picking. He loves him some Ultimate Feast. I usually stick to the coconut shrimp. Our waitress was awesome, the place was packed to the gills but we never really had to wait for refills. She did forget to put in for the beer hubs ordered, but he lived (YAY)! The food comes out hot and fast. We also got an appetizer, did the "pick two" the mozzarella sticks were surprisingly good and the calamari wasn't just fried calamari but it came with fried broccoli and red peppers as well, super tasty!~~#~0
love dicks, richardsons etc etc but come on I'm throwing down 120$ get some  servers / managers with customer service skills.~~#~0
Priced Decent, Quantity Heavy. Just ordered a side of chips and got almost a pound of chips. I love chips and salsa, but this was too much than i thought. Anyway the food was good and seems to have a authentic Mexican flavor to it. Worth a short once, particularly if you are pretty hungry.~~#~0
Ok so the look of the portions in the pictures are very deceptive.  The waffle and pancakes arent big as they look, however I am stuffed so I guess the waffle was big enough.  the food was very good, I thought it would be better, but I am not disappointed.  I would come back here :) the waffle was not as good as the farm and the pancakes were not as good as first watch. but thats just my opinion.  Next time I want to try some of their scrambles.~~#~0
We had our first experience on a Friday night about 6:30. The servers were pleasant.  Wild Thaiger has a nice patio dining facing Central, but it was a little too hot and they didn't have a misting system. The inside was clean with a combo bar and open kitchen. We started with the Freshie Rolls with warm Peanut Sauce and Lychee Martini. Nice, but not the best in town (Pure Sushi Bar has a to die for Lychee Lemon Drop).  The entrees are huge and could easily be shared. We had the Kimow - hot and spicy clear noodles, chicken, broccoli, snow peas, sweet onion, Thai chili, garlic and sweet Thai Basil - Delicious!To be fair, Thai is not one of my favorites, but we love to support local restaurants and this came highly recommended. Glad we tried it. And for those of you who like it HOT and SPICY - Wild Thaiger has you covered.~~#~0
Solid. We hit up the happy hour which features 50% off booze and tacos for $1.50. I had the duck, shrimp, and cochinita pibil (pork). They were tinier than most street-style tacos I've had (and boy howdy, have I eaten a lot of those from Cali to NY) and  even a little soggy. The duck was my least favorite as it had a rubbery taste and texture. The shrimp was A-OK but for my money, the cochinita was really where it's at with his super-porkey deliciousness. We also split the queso fundido (rich with cream cheesey chunks, whaaaat???). It was way tasty but it could probably double for spackle in a pinch. The most successful item of the night was the churros with goat cheese caramel. Between my 3 buddies and myself, we made quick work of that dish. Each of us had their house margarita which was strong (just like I like it), but I'm not entirely sure I'd order that drink for non-happy hour prices. One of the big drawbacks, however, was that our server was really rushed and we had a hard time getting his attention. On the whole, I think I'd be back to try some other items. The chicken mole torta looked really appealing. Be forewarned though, it IS a spendy joint. Expect to pay $15 - $20 for most entrees. On a post-grad shoestring budget, it is certainly a splurge. We did love the mural outback and the groovy art inside.~~#~0
Ye Olde Pipe has a great selection of cigars and a very big walk-in humidor, almost too big. I say that because as I walked around I came across a few boxes of cigars that were way too dry. With that said, I still found SEVERAL cigars that were fresh and moist. What I liked best about Ye Olde was the variety, they had several cigars at all price points, so if you can't afford to smoke an Opus X, they had plenty of cigars for less than $10. If you aren't an avid smoker, I don't know if you will get any help because the staff did not seem very friendly or welcoming, but if you know what you want, there is a good chance they have it.~~#~0
The property is beautiful and clean.  Restaurant's were great.  The problem is the front desk snobs.  No personality.  They messed up my reservations, made me and my family find our own hotel for the night that they messed up?  They didn't even try to get us another room, despite me paying any price.  After a long day of travel with an infant, toddler and wife, the last thing I want to do is look for another hotel at 11 PM, only to come back the next day.The attitude of the front desk is sad and horrible.~~#~0
**********This Time We Didn't  Do Carry-Out**********Definitely better ......... when you eat there.This place is like Pei Wei ........VERY LARGE chunks of meat.Vegatables ...... NEVER.......Just like Pei Wei........their priceless.WARNING:Hot Tea is available for $2.00*********Brown Rice instead of White ......... ALSO $2.00**********The Soups are TERRIBLE.~~#~0
Another disappointed visit.  I am starting to think this isn't a fluke and PB has lost it's magic touch.  We went for my wife's birthday around 4pm on a Wednesday.  We actually walked right in and sat down.  We were both shocked as the least amount of time we have ever waited was well over 3 hours.  The staff was more attentive on where we sat than giving us a genuine greeting even though the place was empty except two other tables.  We put in our order for a margherita with prosciutto, a wise guy, and a caprese salad.The bread came out cold with some oil to dip it in.  I can't remember if it was always cold but it would be nice if they threw it in the oven for 30 seconds before they serve it to you.  Next our pizzas came out and the margherita was missing the prosciutto.  Not a big deal.  Maybe he didn't hear me, maybe the cook didn't hear him?  My wife confirms I did request it and I'm not losing my mind.  The pizzas were good but lacking the usual special touch.  The crust was the best part which is not unusual but what was unusual was the rest was very lack luster.Even though the shop was dead our waiter never came back to us and was back behind the bar laughing and chatting with other staff members.  Finally a blonde woman asks if we would like our bill.  She brings it to us and when I give her my card I gently advise her they forgot my prosciutto and it's on the bill.  Another guy brings the bill back for me to sign.  The 6 dollar prosciutto is still on it.  I inform him that there was no prosciutto and I told the other woman but it's still here.  I don't know if she thought I was just making small talk or what but I sure am not paying 6 bones for some sliced ham that wasn't even on my pizza.  He took care of it.Here's the deal.  I don't know if it's because I didn't wait 3-5 hours to eat or if it's just falling apart without Chef Bianco but PB has definitely lost it's way and is quickly losing the legacy he created whether they want to acknowledge it or not.  I used to think the staff was short and slightly rude because of how busy it was and dealing with upset starving customers brings them down but now I know that is not the case.  They are just not good at what they do and have been there getting away with it for too long.  Just because PB is famous and Chef Bianco is world renown doesn't mean you are.  The dough is good enough to come back for but there is simply no way I would ever wait in line to eat here again.If you read my previous review you will see I am not a PB hater and actually was a huge advocate.  I guess all good things really do come to an end.~~#~0
So-so Mexican food.  I have heard people raving about this place and I don't really get it.  Don't get me wrong, it's better than Manuel's or Filiberto's... but that's about all I can say.Okay, their Pollo Fundido is good (but not great like you will get at Ajo Al's). But let's talk about the purple and teal accent colors that scream "I was remodeled in the 80's"! Lame.Good chips and salsa but small-ass bowls! Oh, and don't expect to park in their little lot during dinner rush.  Also, the surrounding neighborhood is definatly the ghetto-side of the Moon Valley area.~~#~0
* 5 stars for uniqueness - This place has very interesting food and flavors that aren't common around here.* 5 stars for the staff - Everybody was very fast and friendly.* 5 stars for coolness of the location and the establishment - I mean it is pretty cool that this place is in a nicely redone 100-year-old house in a cool part of downtown Phoenix.  Parking is a pain though.However.....Besides feeling hip, cool, urban and trendy; I also felt hungry and ripped off after leaving.  Sure, I could sit there for hours sipping saki and trying every one of their tapas and probably be ok hunger-wise but  I would NOT be ok with the $100+ tab per person that it would surely be.  For me this is more of a fun/interesting place to go before you go out to dinner.~~#~0
Meh, I'm not completely sold.It's so much smaller than a traditional B&N and they did not have anything I was looking for. Nevermind any of the school related supplies I would have like to seen.I don't think I'll come back here, I'll make my way to Borders (yada yada as you will). I won't be going to the next nearest B&N (Tempe) because I don't have a car and the energy just isn't worth it.~~#~0
On a recent visit to Arizona, my mother and I ventured into this store. Neither of us had stepped foot in it before, even though she lives a mile away. The aisles are broken out by cuisine, and the selection was awesome.  I was particularly surprised by the Holland, Dutch, Brazilian, and British aisle, in market classified as Asian. Very unexpected. I bet they would be more business if they boasted to be more international. I really liked this place, but the word needs to get out about Lee Lee's.  If more people shop, they will restock their shelves more often, and most items won't be so close to their expiration date. Final points:- check expiration dates before purchasing- Generally clean but the shelved items needed to be dusted and straightened, especially the aisle with dishes. They were all over the place and had to hunt for matching bowls.  It's a market, not a dollar store- If you can get past the initial fish smell, you won't be disappointed.~~#~0
Other than being a little overpriced on some of their items, it's really good food. I've tried the pesto linguine, fettucine with marinara, grilled cheese with tomato and arugula, linguine with alfredo sauce, caesar salad, their chocolate and vanilla cupcakes, and their chocolate chip scone. The overall price for two adults (with medium drinks) is always about $20. I wouldn't go there all the time, but every now and then I get a craving for their bread they serve with all their pastas or one of their cupcakes.~~#~0
Eyebrows are a very touchy subject. I'm literally convinced that unless you make some serious cash, finding an excellent and meticulous aesthetician is like finding a needle in a haystack. Well, Yelpers, I've been searching in this haystack for three months too long, and each time I leave thinking, "They really don't listen to what I requested and I wasted money." So, I decided, no longer was I going to leave spending $20.00 (tip included) on mediocre brows. I went back to doing my own, and I am completely satisfied.  Plus, the music selection is terrible. A positive, it's neat that they text you a 24 hour reminder notice. However, you better be sure you show up, because they do charge fees for tardies and no-shows.~~#~0
I've eaten at quite a few Yogis Grills since they started opening up in Arizona a handful of years ago. Their teriyaki chicken is pretty good and you get quite a bit for your dollar. However!!! Two things. 1. No matter which location I go to the service always seems sub-par. It seems everyone that works at Yogis Grill just seems uninterested and lacks the ability to be friendly. *shrug* Its not overly bothersome to me but it would be nice to have friendlier service. 2. Their sushi, is not that good and they are ridiculously over priced. I can go to Kona Grill which is a nice restaurant and get much better tasting sushi for nearly $2.00 cheaper! I just can't get past how expensive their rolls are AND it doesn't taste much better then grocery store sushi. I'll still go there for teriyaki but not for sushi, its just not worth it.~~#~0
I have to admit, I love a good Philly Cheesesteak sandwiches...So when I heard about this place I had  try it.  We made the drive down there...park in the parking garage off of 5th st.  Walked to the resturant and was pretty impressed.  Place was really clean, guys behind the counter were as nice as philly people can be.  Then I looked at the menu, saw what I wanted to order and ordered it.  I ordered an full size cheesesteak with cheese wiz...i made it a combo.  I was shocked that it came out to like $13 for a sandwich, drink and fries.  When I finally got my food, I was impressed with the taste but don't know if it's worth the $13 I paid for it.  If you don't want the combo, the full sandwich is still $9.  So if you want a good sandwich, be prepared to friggin pay for it.~~#~0
Dined here last Friday night.  I know this is considered one of the better Chinese restaurants, but I am struggling w/ a 2 vs 3 star rating.The eggrolls, pot stickers were good.  Pot stickers are actually quite stuffed.I got one of the chow mein dishes w/ the noodles done Hong Kong style, fried.  The dish itself was fine, but the noodles were weird.  Part of them looked like they had not been put in oil and fried adequately...they were dried and stiff.  I pulled that bit out onto my extra plate.  The daugher liked her Kung Pao chicken.  Hubbie's shrimp dish was good too, but the broccoli ringing the dish could have been cooked just a little bit longer...it was pretty much raw.Table was a little sticky. Ultimately, I felt I could go to another chinese restaurant and have a similar meal, maybe Tao would be slightly better?  Or Tao is slightly worse?  I can't get past those noodles.  Yuck.I think ultimately if I'm in the mood for Asian, I'm not gonna go the Chinese route.  Go to asian for me right now is Anise.~~#~0
When checking in I was greeted by the General Manager. It was nice talking to you Michael; I hope to see you at the Westin La Paloma. The Sheraton is great for a night stay if you plan on going to the airport. I stayed with my family for one night and caught a shuttle to the airport at 3:30am (Complimentary). Ugh so early, but my driver was very friendly. The night auditor was very helpful and was able to give my family a late check-out till 1:30. SO AWESOME!  I love late check outs, they make your day/morning better. No need to rush. The bathroom is a little small, vanity area is limited but fully stocked and you get a loofa.My little sister and Mom enjoyed the pool as well. Nice small patio area to enjoy from your room too. If I ever have to fly out of Phoenix or into Phoenix and have to stay over my choice is definitely the Sheraton Phoenix Airport.~~#~0
Meh.~~#~0
A nice place to watch a game... nice that it is open enough that you can keep an eye on the game while you survey your many dining alternatives.I also they let some natural sunlight and keep the place cool at the same time.Anyway I don't have a good reason to give this place one star, or five stars, hence three stars.~~#~0
This place isn't all that but there food is OK.  There are better Chinese options for the price (try Chinese Cultural Center restaurants).  The restaurant itself is well furnished and clean but I can't get over the fact that people rave about this place.~~#~0
We were here for a weekend during Spring Training and over St. Patrick's Day. Good location, within walking distance to Scottsdale Rd and also Camelback. Comfy beds and also friendly front desk. Here's the only issue: we had a hadicapped room. This I am sure is ADA compliant and that's great, but having an open shower in the bathroom that has slippery tiles can create a safety issue with slips and falls considering there is one drain that isn't elevated. So we had to put down about 5 towels on the floor that were drenched with water when we showered. Next time I'd like to stay in a non-handicapped room....Also on weekends, try to extend the breakfast hours past 9:30 please!~~#~0
Threw a friend's baby shower here and it went pretty smoothly. We made reservations well in advance, and it was a small party. I'm not a huge fan of their food but it's always busy so clearly other people don't have my same opinion. The three stars is for the service, they were super attentive and everything was taken care of for our party. I just don't think the cheesecake is that great, I'm sorry! But the apps aren't too bad.~~#~0
If you are going out for beer than Papago Brewing in the same strip mall is a much better choice. But if you are looking for a true bar with liquor and beer than the British Open certainly qualifies.  Not a huge fan of the food with the exception of the fried pickles. Typical greasy pub fare. Darts and pool tables and a good juke box. Service is usually pretty good every time I've been in there.  Very dark and very much a neighborhood bar.~~#~0
I love the layout of this outdoor bar. However, the price of drinks here and the lack of well options is a huge turn off. It's also going to be interesting to see if people are into the idea of an outdoor "dance club" once summer comes back around. The view is awesome. I'm always up for supporting independent downtown businesses, this place just needs to make some changes to make me want to come back.~~#~0
The very definition of an average brunch.  My omelet was pretty decent, and it's nice that they let you choose a bunch of ingredients if you want to.  However the breakfast potatoes are extremely weak, fairly bland and underseasoned and are probably not hand cut and prepared.  They are mixed with an uninspiring blend of green peppers.   The rest of my table seemed to feel about as enthusiastic as I did about their breakfast burritos.The service was also pretty slow.  Despite the awesome patio and pretty good eye candy among the patronage here, this place is definitely one you can skip.~~#~0
Went to this place for the first time the other night.. Biggest plus for the place is that it has its own parking with some one checking to make sure you are there for the restaurant, the one thing I hate about downtown is parking. On to the food, a basic dinner of Pork fried rice, chicken chow mien, and Kung Pao chicken... It was okay. The Pork fried rice was basic and the chow mien was too slimy. The Kung Pao chicken was alright, kind of disappointed in its lack of sauce but the veggies and almonds that came where good. Pretty much, this place is good for quick and cheap food.The staff was helpful and kind and the restaurant had a cute downtown vibe to it with a random birdcage in the middle. Overall I would try it again, but will try something different on the menu.~~#~0
Another place that's walking distance. Subway is one of those places where you can't go wrong....you got 5-dollar value meals or foot longs. The guys are really friendly and aren't stingy with the toppings. I'm not a big fan of the smell subway's have though. Eh anyways its just one of those places where im lazy and don't want to make a sandwich...plus it helps me keep my girlish figure like jared :)~~#~0
Love this Cold Stone if only for the fact that around the time you would be leaving dinner in one of the close restaurants, the strip mall this location is in is basically shut down. We didn't have any wait whatsoever.~~#~0
Seriously the best 3am quesadilla I have ever had.  It was big and gooey, with just enough browning on the outside of the tortilla to make it a little bit crisp.  As an added bonus it was kind of cold outside, so it made a great hand warmer as well.  Why only 3 stars?  OK, you do have to sit on some questionable outside picnic tables and I don't want to think about how clean the kitchen may or may not be, but the entertainment value of watching tipsy people stumble around while waiting for their food can't be beat.~~#~0
I have been to this location several times because again, right around the corner from my salon. I so want to be able to give it a higher rating but every time I go the service is really not that great. Last week I went for wing and Wii night, 30 cent wings cant be beat. I have had better wings, but hey this is a Mexican joint and our bill was not even $4! But our waitress looked like she could care less about being there, never asked if we wanted a refill on our chips and salsa and never stopped by the table to see if we like our food. Now being in the service industry and having spent many years as a server I get that you think since the bill is so low your tip is going to suck. That simply doesn't have to be the case, we left our server a $6 tip and we weren't even there long. You get 4 tables like that an hour you are set, so perk up and smile, you never know how far that can go. I went there last night for Taco Tuesdays, $1 to $2 tacos can't be beat and the tacos are so tasty I always order 3, the mahi, crunchy fish and steak. The mahi was flaky and sweet, the crunchy taco had a sweet taste to it with the sauce and red onion. Not greasy at all. The steak was tender and flavorful. Again though our service was sub par. We had already finished our chips and salsa before we even got our water, took way to long, same with the food and it wasn't even that busy. We were sitting inside and there were only 20 people in the bar area and there was only one other table eating. Now our server wrote our order on her had, she seemed tired and frazzled, and we had to bring our bill to her at the end to check out, we waited a while before doing that. It seemed like she might have been the only server in the place, but she did have the help of a gentleman by the name of Frenchy. I liked Frenchy, big dude but with dry wit and he seemed like the jack of all trades for the place. Doorman, food runner, busser, you name it he was doing it. I will continue to come to Loco because the tacos are so damn good but I just hope they figure out the staff issues. I gave it 4 times and every time my complaint is the same, the service needs to step it up.~~#~0
I hate the heat. HATE. Yet I am doomed to reside in this heat haven so when my best friend raved about a place where you can sit outside in Arizona and not feel the heat I had to check it out. By the time I ventured downtown to glance at this place Phoenix was experiencing a cool down so the patio was very comfortable without the fans and misters. Our waitress was great and even chatted about our night and my favorite bar, SideBar. We got the L.B. favorite lavosh and I okayed the bacon even though it didn't sound too appetizing. It wasn't. I ordered some chicken sandwich that was on a french roll. The salad on the side was better than the sandwich. My friend ordered the classic turkey which was large but average. BUT I think ordering the classic sandwich was a boring mistake of its own. The fries that came with the turkey were greasy and when I ordered a amber ale and some guy brought a pale ale. I like pale ale so it wasn't too bad but it made me yearn for the amber. Yes, or course I ordered the amber next.The waitress told us that the island bar was opening the next day but there were still ladders and paint cans lying around. I failed to notice until my friend mentioned it. The only really cool thing about this place is that it is in a historic building with strange bathrooms. Other than that I would skip it.~~#~0
I noticed the sign for Shakey Jake's before it even opened. I waited paitiently for it to wait... I love barbeque! :) When it finally opened, my mom and I tried to get some grub there when we walked up, the cutest little boy came out of the resturant and told us they were close and would be open again tomorrow. We left disappointed but still wanted to give Jake's a try.Over a month later, we finally did get a chance to do just that.We entered Shakey Jakes and saw a nice, new & clean place. There was a large counter, and several red t-shirt wearing workers dishing up what looked & smelled like yummy barbeque. We waited in line and were handed menus. The walkways were narrow and left a small amount of space to sit. We were feeling the scrunch! We then sat down with our menus and chose our meals.I went back to the register & was disappointed in the fact that they didn't have any more MacNCheese and there was some miscommunication when it came to my mom's order. I thought it came with Fries... and it didn't, it comes with a side dish. My mom wanted Cole Slaw AND fries... instead I accidentily ordred JUST cole slaw... but they charged me an extra fee for the cole slaw... so really, I just got screwed out of a side dish and it was pretty much downhill from there.I didn't see the lil baskets of utensils and lids and straws on top of the very tall deli case. I had to take our recipt and the cups and I pourd our drinks and sat down. The TVs were SO damned loud we were shouting at eachother. I wanted to scream "can you PLEASE turn that down?!" My mom had to use the rest room and I told her she needed a key, which I learned from a previous review.Anyway, finally our food came and our order number was called and I got up thinking I had to bring it to the table, when their server told me to sit down and that she'd bring it to us... ummm... okay? but as she did, she told us that the utensils were by the register. WTF?! ARGHHH!! I was JUST there!! It was ackward, uncomfortable, annoying and frustrating.So i got up AGAIN, if I could have just picked up my own order, I could have also gotten my utensils in one big graceful swoop. I THINK the owners need to give out those lil numbers for their tables, think Carl's Jr. So there's no more confusion. AND give out those lil bags with utensils, napkin, salt & pepper packets. Because I'm 5'6" and I had to get on my TIPPY Toes to see what the hell was in those baskets! Also, I ordered two medium sodas, and none of their lids fit. They were TOO small or TOO large!The cashier was really nice, but the smaller things made this place intolerable. I couldn't walk to our table without hitting EACH and every single table and chair... ugh, that's the last thing I need. a reminder that maybe having yet another meal out is the LAST thing I should be subjecting my body to.I sat down and looked at my plate, the fuck?! I ordered pork ribs, and they gave me beef. I looked at the recipt and it said... beef. *harsh sigh* lucky for them, they both cost the same! I remembered reading their sign underneith the cashier that said they'd be happy to help you out if there's anything wrong with your order IF the food was untouched and IF you still had your recipt. sooooo... because the cashier hit beef instead of pork and I paid - I was screwed.Choosing to just go with it, I opened up my side dishes and the yams were good. nothing great, but still good. The cole slaw was way too sweet for me. The corn bread was good!! The highlight of the meal! their cornbread is better than LoLo's! There I said it! I just wish Shakey Jake's would make theirs bigger. The ribs were VERY good, they had a serious smoke ring and the sauce had a nice bite to it. My mom didn't care for her sandwich, she said there wasn't enough sauce and that the meat was very fatty. She liked the yams and the coleslaw. We both agreed that the peach cobbler was YUMMY! I just wish they baked it longer.When we left, I was full and not as aggravated like I was before. I do want to give Shakey Jake's another chance (maybe without my mom). To my yelpers, if you go - be sure the check your recipt, get your utensils right after you order & expect a server to bring your food when it's done.~~#~0
I love this facility!  It's clean and bright.  It has an indoor track, a good number of cardio machines and weight machines.  It has an awesome indoor basketball court which sometimes gets used for extreme training and volleyball.  It has a couple of nice aerobics room, plus a couple of racketball courts and a rock climbing wall to boot.  I primarily joined so that I could lap swim.  Unfortunately, they limit the times that the pool is open to 5AM - 7AM, 11AM - 1PM, and 5:30PM - 7PM - times when there's a lifeguard available.  And during the summer, the pool is overrun with kids, and the afternoon lap swimming gets pushed back to 6:30PM start. to accommodate the local swim team.  These times don't work for me.  Also, during the summer time, it was close to 4 swimmers per lane.  The teenage lifeguards don't impose the slow to fast lane designations and don't remind people to circle swim.  I never got a good lap swim workout.  But the pool is kept up impeccably, and the locker room is nice (except during the summer time when the kids make everything sticky)  A great facility overall.~~#~0
Had a coupon so decided to have lunch at Wildflower. The food was pretty good, similar to other specialty bakeries. The cashier was not super friendly, but the manager was. Would go back, just felt that nothing overly stood out about this place.~~#~0
The employees here are really nice and I like the island feel. The food is pretty good and I like it because there aren't many other places in town with Hawaiian food. I also like that you can get beer here.~~#~0
I wasn't sure what to expect. This was stop 1 on the pub crawl.  There was an emo looking couple in a booth a table full of patrons (they looked like regulars)The artwork on the walls was dark and ecclectic, but the place didn't have a dark feel.I can't say this would be "my" bar. But if I were in the neighborhood I would go to this bar for a few drinks and some hummus.~~#~0
Unlike a lot of the other reviewers, I actually had a decent experience here. We came in yesterday (Sunday) around 2. The place was pretty quiet, excluding the plethora of football fans who came here to watch their games. They have a ton of TVs to do so, including a HUGE screen that was playing the Cardinals game. No complaints about that. Some of the guys were rowdy but hey so am I when I watch football. It took us a while to be seated. I'm not quite sure where the hostess was. As soon as we were seated we were helped by a very pretty and sweet girl. Our food took a while even though the place was pretty dead, but what we got was satisfying. We started with the nachos which were really good and then I got their jalapeno burger and my friend got their pork sandwich sliders. The fries were seasoned well and crispy. The service needs some work: nonexistent hostesses, disappearing servers, slow cooks, but this place could be a real gem.~~#~0
I don't really get what all the buzz is about. Coming from SoCal I think In N Out has this place beat. I can get a small burger and small fries from Five Guys and I am beyond full the rest of the day. The Cajun fries are OK but I kind of freak out when the bag carrying your food gets stained from all of the grease.Why I'm giving three stars instead of two is that I JUST discovered their hot dogs and those are FANTASTIC. I never need to have another burger from here, I'll stick with my double doubles......but the hot dogs???? VOILA!!!!And their soda machine is really cool too. It's touch screen so once you pick your soda, you then get to add flavors. It's really cool. If they had a soda machine on The Starship Enterprise, it would be the soda fountain from Five Guys....except that it would have to be voice command.Anyway, I'll be back for the weiners and to play with the soda machine~~#~0
I decided to check this place out after getting a coupon in my Savvy Shopper magazine for 25% off. I am a fan of all of the little self serve yogurt places popping up but I must be honest that this place is no different than all of the rest. Be careful that you don't overload your cup or you will end up paying a lot by the time they weigh your dessert!~~#~0
fry's is conveniently located at w germann rd and s alma rd, has a reasonably large selection, and prices are fair.  when grocery shopping, i look for and purchase items based on the best value in terms of product, freshness, selection, and convenience.  i check the weekly sale ads and circle the best buys usually at 3 different food & drug stores.  since these are consumable, recurring items, i will look for opportunities to stock up when great deals come up. the site is clean, well stocked and well organized. common purchases include some baking goods, packed meats, breads, cereals, canned products and eggs. a surprising find...there's a sushi kiosk at the back of the store near the packaged meats section.  so, i buy the freshly made sushi - spicy crab roll, cali roll and tuna roll. it's actually really good.  i usually shop for produce elsewhere, same with laundry products, beauty products and dog food.  those reviews to follow soon.  scored a little lower since parking is usually a near-accident on the weekends, with so many vendors and customers-in-such-a-hurry at that busy shopping center.~~#~0
This is the "other" Coffee Plantation that I always forget about even though it is right by where I grew up. Weird, huh?Actually, it isn't weird. Because this Coffee Plantation blends into its stripmall surroundings so seamlessly that you totally forget it's there. They take absolutely  no chance with decor or ambiance. For all you know, it's part of the laundromat next door. Coffee isn't bad and it never seems to be too busy so it's actually an undercover great spot to get some things done without worry of distraction. Not sure of the wifi situation, but a good book on a rainy afternoon and this place would suit you well.~~#~0
Good salad options. It is definitely tough to mess up lettuce and veggies.  As for the rest of the selection, we must have just come on a bad night. The pasta was overcooked and mushy, not even close to al dente.  Fresh fruit selection consisted of only 3 fruits, not exactly a vast selection.  If you want a good salad, definitely the place to go.~~#~0
We were still on a search for New Mexican food and I read up on this place and it was also recommended by a friend.  It was average, not very New Mexican.  I tried the pecan grilled shrimp tacos and they were good! My boyfriend got the stacked enchiladas which was just ok.  Still on the hunt for good New Mexican food in AZ.~~#~0
This place gets an A for effort, but I think it falls slightly short. It's neat/cute that the wasabi is actually blue, and some of their rolls (like the pink dyed rice for the Marilyn Monroe roll) are innovative, but the food is only a little above average. I liked the rolls okay, but the best thing I put in my mouth was the shrimp tempura appetizer in the martini glass. That appetizer is to die for! The miso soup was pretty good, but not my favorite. We did like the fact that there were only a few tables and it wasn't a huge place with a million people, but the food just wasn't what we expect. We are going to continue hunting for our favorite sushi restaurant in Scottsdale.....the service here was very good, though, which made the experience pretty pleasant overall.~~#~0
I didn't have a fully immersed Portland's experience, so perhaps I am selling them a bit short, but as far as my experience went, it was A-OK.We stopped in because of its proximity to the light rail and our need for alcoholic refreshment.  We had a couple beers (small selection - but we found something we really liked) and a glass of wine (reasonably priced, tasty) The service was fine, the prices fine.  Everything was fine.And that's just it.  Does 'Fine' merit a 'Yay! I'm a fan', four star review.  No it does not.  Maybe the food is out of this world.  Maybe at night this place lights up and sparkles in a way that the daytime cannot convey.  Its on the light rail, so I may give it another attempt, but on first glance, Portland's is just A-OK.~~#~0
It usually takes a good word of mouth review from a friend for me to try a new Chinese restaurant. However, I was craving this cuisine and this restaurant is close by and tucked away in a small quiet strip mall. Wasn't busy at all on a Friday evening. We were greeted right away as we entered into the clean, open, no frills dining room. We ordered beef and broccoli, chicken fried rice and lo mien. As we waited our super friendly server offered bowls of egg drop soup on the house. The soup was a nice touch but nothing superb. I was satisfied with our meal but it was not the best I've tasted. Fried rice was a little bland. Beef and broccoli was delicious. Overall I'd say the service was way better than the food.~~#~0
Cracker's & Company has always been a favorite breakfast destination. The food is always delicious and the selection more unique than other restaurants. My husband and I came in for a quiet Anniversary breakfast and although the place wasn't terribly crowded, we were seated right next to a table of ill mannered children and their mothers. I would have asked to move but our waitress was missing in action from the start of our visit. Before our waitress went MIA we ordered our drinks and entrees. In the past I have been given a small carafe of coffee but was only given a cup today which was disappointing. I ordered a carrot cake muffin when I ordered my entree and asked to have it served right away with my coffee. I also asked for the hollandaise sauce on the side of my "New Princess" omelet but it was spread over the top when it was delivered to my table along with my muffin. So much for enjoying my muffin with my one cup of coffee.  However, the food was wonderful as usual. The service was horrible and the ambiance was equally as poor. I'd hate to see a wonderful restaurant such as Crackers lose their edge in this competitive food service industry. I'm hoping today was a fluke and the service will improve to its previous caliber.~~#~0
Dam you Doug !!!Ok, I thought I be the first but Doug beat me to it.  Any establishment that has a free happy hour for it's guest is a plus nuff said. Yes -the 4th floor grill is awesome and the bar staff will give you the In's & outs of Scottsdal-ing culture and the pizza they serve is pretty dam good- the complimentary breakfast was was actually good too. I'm not sure if they still do the free happy hour thing but what sold me on this lets say resort - is that while I was there , there was a whole bus full of girls that where promoting - some kinda of alcoholic beverage - and I heard from a good source many beverage companies uses the Chaparral as a pit stop for their promotional tours... Word- I guess they come for the pool's...~~#~0
Pretty good place.  You never actually know who is your server because several different people actually wait on you.  The service can be slow at times which can get annoying.  The space is pretty big, bigger than what it seems from the street.  The food was so-so.~~#~0
I would have given this a higher rating except for the prices.  Ok - in this economy, I am lucky to be able to eat out at all.  However, $11 for their smallest sandwich and two small sides and a drink ($1.99 each!!) is a little pricey especially if you have a family to feed.  They should consider making it a buffet since they charge buffet prices or giving you a little more for you money.But, yes, the food is good.~~#~0
I had very high expectations for The Breakfast Joynt because so many gave it 5 stars, which means "As good as it gets, Woohoo!" according to Yelp.  My experience didn't live up to that but I'm willing to give them another try.This location was formerly a bar that was transformed into a breakfast restaurant.  The actual bar is still there, with a flat panel TV in the middle, but surprisingly the shelves are still empty all the way up to the ceiling.  They've only been there around 6 months, so maybe this will change as they settle into the location.  It has a very clean, upscale feel to it - something not out of place in North Scottsdale.  It's also easy to find once you're off the 101 onto Raintree, and then north on Northsight... it's on the right and shares parking with Gold's Gym that is easily seen from the road.I found the eggs to be good, and recommend steering towards the omelet choices.  Being from the South, it wasn't thrilling that the biscuits were somewhat small and square shaped, almost like a little dinner roll.  They have their own style (and they've informed me that they are homemade) but I was looking for something more substantial to be smothered in sausage gravy.  The pancakes were not served hot with the other food items, and they seemed to have settled and were somewhat chewy and elastic.Menu was rather straightforward and clear with sectioned boxes, with a nice highlight of their featured stuffed apple pancake.  I thought the description of "ham that falls off the bone" was repeated far too many times.Prices were very reasonable for Scottsdale.  The fresh squeezed orange juice was excellent.  Owners are very concerned about customers with less than a stellar dining experience, so I'll be sure to give the Breakfast Joynt another try with friends and family.~~#~0
Typical dumpy yet fairly clean little sports bar in a strip mall setting. Get your tires changed next door at Discount Tire and grab a few heinekins while you wait. Beware though, they call it coppers because it is owned and frequented by Cops and for some reason there are a lot of people missing limbs that frequent the place.?. hum. ho.~~#~0
A very  good sandwhich shop!  My boy and I stopped in here after a movie at the AMC.  They have a neat concept with the bags on the wall where you mark your items.My only wish is that they had cold sandwhiches as well as the toasted variety.  I am not always (rarely in fact) in the mood for a toasted sandwhich.The italian sandwhich I got though was delicious.NOM NOM NOM~~#~0
I've got to hand it to Smart & Final for providing some incredibly economic pricing options for both name brand products and supplies. It's worth a visit to save some big bucks by shopping here. This is one of my go-to stops for party supplies like plates, cups, napkins, water, etc. Think of Smart & Final like the Dollar Store meets Costco.~~#~0
Its not in a shell gas station anymore and i guarantee that Guy would never visit the new location on his show. I ordered the El Pastor burrito and i didn't like it at all, very dry and just not to my liking. I would never order it again but I'm sure there are alot of people out there that like it. The salsa was great and i couldn't get enough of it. I ate half of a bean and cheese burrito and i really liked that also, not the greatest tortillas ever but they are possibly #3. I would could back and id like to try some other type of burrito or some carne asada tacos.~~#~0
Went to Prado for a birthday celebration and things started off very well - it's a beautiful dining room, and the live guitar music is a nice addition. The hostess and maitre d' were both friendly and personable. They pour you a glass of sherry on the way to sit down at the table, a lovely touch of authentic Spain. All good so far. However, the food is very hit or miss, as others have suggested. Some dishes really shined (butternut squash soup, bison short rib, pineapple coconut cake) while others really disappointed (one-dimensional gazpacho, chewy calamari, fish overpowered by olive tapenade). My advice: soak in the atmosphere and music at the bar, maybe snack on some tapas, but skip the restaurant unless you're okay with hit-and-miss. Such a shame, too, because I LOVED Chef Urciuoli's cuisine when he was at Taggia.~~#~0
Sometimes there's a cover, and sometimes there isn't. In true nightclub fashion, you can never really tell what it's going to be either. I've never seen anything good happen downstairs. The music has never been good, regardless of the genre that night (Hip Hop, Techno, etc). And, the overall vibe is pretty lackluster.Upstairs, however, is house music heaven. Located outside under the stars, on a relatively small balcony, the vibe is always pretty stellar. Open air, video collages on the walls, and AWESOME music. I've never been let down yet. Even on a random Wednesday evening recently, when it was almost empty, the music was still amazing.If you live in the Valley, you have to visit the upstairs of Bar Smith at least once. It's fantastic. It's a shame they've never been able to replicate any of the upstairs magic to the rest of the club though.~~#~0
When I asked the server where he was from, it led to a discussion about   how historically trains would stop in Maricopa!  All joking aside, this place is a good after dinner spot or happy hour spot to come and chat with a friend about why there are no Amtrack train stops in Phoenix!  They have a decent wine list and I would not really sit outside here because it is nothing really special...but the place has its purpose.~~#~0
Definitely a solid choice for some quick healthier alternatives.  Good Wraps with quality ingredients.~~#~0
Chicken schnitzel was amazing. Service was slow and server didn't know the menu. Didn't know what a knish was.~~#~0
I can't comment on the donuts (which is pretty ridiculous seeing as that's the main draw here), but I was satisfied with the boba smoothies. They're definitely not anywhere close to being great, but for someone who's not picky about boba, they're really refreshing. The boba itself was kind of mediocre, but it had a good flavour and wasn't too sweet. I got a taro smoothie and a honeydew smoothie. The honeydew tasted surprisingly good for being from a powdered mix, it was just like drinking a fresh honeydew melon. The taro was even better, although the drinks were a bit too icy for me. They were a lot better after I let the ice melt a bit, but who wants to wait?~~#~0
Singray is pretty good. The location is nice but there is never parking due to the other businesses around. Not fun walking so far in heels. :) The sashimi was pretty fresh, but miso was a little too salty. Also they gave us cold oshibori towels when we sat at the sushi bar. I think I prefer the new Pure Sushi location next to AZ88. Once I was able to find it. Very modern cool feel and awesome food. Heard Stingray is opening another location by my house. (Biltmore area) Maybe parking will be better.~~#~0
I used to frequent this restaurant years and years ago. I was a student at the Deer Valley airport, and eventually a flight instructor as well. It was a great location with awesome views. The food was always descent the the service was great. Nothing too exciting, but a great place.~~#~0
Over-priced for the size of the facility and equipment available. The staff is friendly enough, and seeing as how its the closest 24 hour fitness place in this neighborhood, i suppose they get away with the price :)~~#~0
I love burgers and really wanted to love The Grind, but it wasn't meant to be. Unfortunately I had problems with the temperatures, both the restaurant and the food.I was here with my girlfriend on a Tuesday night. The restaurant itself is nicely appointed, with a sleek, modern look and feel. It was pretty close to full, but staff were still friendly and efficient. The $5/glass wine special they were running was very nice. I has the peppercorn burger with sweet potato fritters. The fritters were very nice, crunch without being greasy, and not overly sweet. The burger was nicely composed with great toppings and flavors - the watercress in particular stood out. Unfortunately, the burger was also well, well done, and I had ordered medium. I should have sent it back, but was hungry and didn't want to wait. For a burger joint missing a temperature on a burger is pretty disappointing and it killed a lot of the goodwill the rest of the ingredients had built up. The bread pudding for desert wasn't the best I've ever had, but was nice and the bourbon sauce it came with was a nice touch. The other issue I had with The Grind is the temp inside the restaurant. I'll grant that these are the dog days of summer right now, and I'm sure it's hard to keep the place cool with the half open kitchen, but was pretty warm in there.With the wine special it was ok value for the money I guess. But on a normal night with $10-12/glass for wine and $10 for a burger with another $4 for fries it's too pricey for my tastes, especially if they aren't hitting proper temps on the burgers every time.~~#~0
The Arizona Science Center offers a series of programs called adult's night out  which are held the first Friday of every month. These lectures cover focused overviews on topics ranging from Genetics and Nanotechnology to Native American medicinal utilization of native plants found in the Southwest. There is always interesting science or engineering content but the value and interest of the talks is essentially the somewhat direct non-mass-media poisoned or dumbed down views of the individual speakers themselves. While I would attend the talks regardless I have found additional value in the evening because of the extended hours that the science center offers which allows you to catch an IMAX film and see the latest flavor of exhibit (Body Worlds, Titanic, etc.) after the lecture. I would have loved to have given the Science Center 4 stars but I am constantly annoyed by the science center's staff inability to get one of the three microphones set up correct for the speakers ahead of time causing a speaker to waste 5-10 minutes every month.Beer and wine are available for purchase during the event. The adult's night out lectures are free, normal planetarium, IMAX, and special exhibit prices still apply.Arizona Science Center Web Site:www.azscience.orgAdult's Night Out:www.azscience.org/adults_night_out.php~~#~0
The hole in the rock was pretty interesting, but only for about 5 minutes. It's not a hike at all, more of a walk on unpaved ground. Once you're up there, the view is pretty cool, but the crowds of people and rowdy kids and dogs detract from the magnificence and romance. I'd think it's a great place to take kids, though, because of how easy it is. Good thing it's located in Papago Park so you can go and see the zoo or the gardens or Hunt's Tomb while you're there. If you go just to see the hole, it's kind of a waste of time.~~#~0
Went here for fathers day with my girlfriends parents because they gave a free entree for dad. He choose the fish and chips which looked amazing, I had fish tacos, my girlfirend had the steak and her mom got a salad. Everyhting was good. The service was great and the beers were decent. It was everything I could expect from a chain and thensome. I might even go back.~~#~0
Great place, well maintained. It's big airport with some long walks.~~#~0
When I came here I got half a dozen donuts and one of those boba drinks. The donuts were really good, but I wouldn't say they were any better than a Dunkin Donuts or Krispy Kreme. The boba drink was so good though! I'm really happy they have those. :)~~#~0
Cherubini is a clean, comfortable coffee shop.  The employees are friendly, but  no more than every other coffee shop I've been to.I had a decaf drip coffee, which was just o.k.  Nothing to complain about but not particularly noteworthy.I sampled 4 donuts...raised with maple, cherry iced cake, blueberry cake, and sugar raised.  The donuts were about average or a little higher.  Better than Dunkin but nowhere close to BoSa.  The cherry iced cake was the best, but all the donuts seemed a little too sweet.  I'm a donut fanatic, so I don't mind sweet...but these, just a little too much.Kudos for keeping up a good appearance and free Wi-Fi, but I won't go out of my way to visit Cherubini again.~~#~0
PPP was decent. The white chocolate beer was delicious. I will be back for some more of that. I cannot wait to go back for happy hour. Steak is steak to me. It was not out of this world, but it was good. The sides were fair, beans and bread. The beans lacked flavor, but I might just be biased, my dad makes a mean pot of cowboy beans. The whole restaurant is very kitschy. Everything revolves around the cowboy theme. This place would be great to take tourists. -1 for undercooked steak -1 for tasteless beans~~#~0
I had seen these around before but never stopped in. Started with a drink menu and was quite happy. Good selection of Margaritas and others. The dinner menu was good as well. Drinks were excellent and food was tasty.I'll make a return trip if for nothing more than a drink. A-OK.~~#~0
Foot Locker is home to the largest selection of athletic shoes in the mall but the pricing could be better.  Their inventory also includes a dozen or so Foot Locker exclusives like several Nike Air Max 95 colorways.  Foot Locker sweats, hoodies, and other athletic gear are generally durable, fit well, and priced well.  The Chandler store also places some focus on team athletic apparel and miscellaneous sports accessories.  The sales aren't that great.  I saw a pair of Jordan CMFT's in the white/gray/black colorway selling for $80.  I bought the same pair at a Nike Outlet in New Jersey in July for $50.  What's up with that?I can't call it...~~#~0
This gym is alright. I thought from the way it looked outside it would be much bigger, but it does the job. Staff is friendly and welcoming.  I rather enjoy all the classes here- especially zumba. The instructor reminds me of a young Richard Simmons heehee. Yes, there are some touches that scream "90's" like the neon signs by the locker room, but who cares. It's a gym not a prissy spa. I'm there to sweat!~~#~0
This store is a average. It has a six month wall. This place does not bag and board new issues unless asked. The store specializes in new stuff only and has almost no back stock. The store has tournaments for card gaming on weekends. The staff doesn't talk to new customers much or ask them if they need assistance. Note for true comic fans...This store is good for new comics on Wednesdays and supplies but that is about it. Dime-a-dozen store... nothing special.~~#~0
Bar Smith has potential to be a chic hot spot in the heart of downtown; just a few steps away from the symphony hall, Chase Field, and the US airways Arena. However, this place, despite it's pseudo-hipness fails to deliver in the cocktail department, which, with it's continuously crappy music, would be the only real reason you'd come to this bar. It's really a 2.5 star place-- bartenders are nice,but don't really get the job done. When you're paying over $8/drink, you'd at least expect them to do that. The roof is cool though so an extra .5 stars for that.~~#~0
Great breakfast!  The rest of the menu however is average.~~#~0
I like it better then Denny's so I stop on by to get some breakfast. It's okay not the best place in the world but if your having a hard time picking between after hours with Dennys and Waffle house I would pick waffle house for sure.~~#~0
Cliché Central. Style without substance can be summed up in their cheese plate: pineapple, melon, grapes, herbed chevre, Babybel minis (they even leave the wax on for ya) and cubes of pepper jack and colby jack served with sesame crackers.  I can't make this gold up.  They serve a lot of "martinis" as the name implies, very few of which actually contains the ingredients for a proper martini.  But then again, now that I've described the cheese plate, this should come as no surprise.  If you, dear reader, decide to open a bar, it's really quite simple.  Get everyone drunk, quickly, and hire bathroom attendants willing to squirt soap into your customers' hands.  Oh hell no, we're not in a recession.  The Ferrari up front was paid in cash, I'm quite sure.  And that woman over there? 100% real.  Ok that degraded fairly quickly.  Like my evening.  If you strip everything away and look at it for what it is, Blue Martini is stylish spot to get drunk in an attempt to forget reality.  If that's your thing, and want to feel better about your age, check it out.~~#~0
I tasted my first Qdoba burrito last night. I went with the Queso Steak burrito. The burrito was hearty with lots of meat, rice and beans topped off with pico and some cheese and sour cream. My wife enjoyed her chicken burrito bowl with similar ingredients.I've had many burritos from taquerias to the burrito chains. Qdoba falls somewhere in the middle. I would gladly take a Qdoba burrito over a Chipotle or Una Mas burrito any day based on my initial experience.The staff was friendly and we were in and out for our take out order within 3-5 minutes.~~#~0
Nice place...Need more restaurants..! Pretty huge airport...so long walks..!~~#~0
1. Good Customer Service2. Clean Atmosphere3. Good Margaritas4. YUMMIE Carna Asada Burrito~~#~0
This is more of a pizza joint for people who have young kids. They have kid games and it gets pretty noisy in here. The pizza is not too bad . If I was craving pizza, this place would not be high on my list but, it was an 'interesting' experience nonetheless. I suppose If I had kids or I was a kid I would probably enjoy coming here.~~#~0
Totally sufficient for a few rounds of pool or darts while keeping an eye on the 67 tv screens they have mounted on the walls.Just stick to the cheap pitchers of domestic beer. I ordered a rum and coke and it tasted like cleaning products. I would come back, but only if I didn't feel like driving all the way to Lucky Break in Tempe.~~#~0
Calling all Vegans, Gluten Free's, Vegetarians and those who enjoy eating healthy. Nourish is probably your Garden of Eden. Hidden within the Optima, Nourish is a health food fan's paradise. The environment is fresh and clean and so is the food. Upon walking inside, I noticed how calm and refreshing the restaurant was. Everyone had the same calm attitude and I could tell that this is a restaurant you visit to relax and still feel healthy when you leave. The menu is detailed but not overwhelming. The only overwhelming part was trying to decipher what each icon indicated and soon I learned that most of the food is gluten free, vegan, vegetarian or some other food lifestyle other than carnivore. But, for those not following an alternative food lifestyle, it's still incredibly tasty and makes me rethink my cuisine decisions! Nourish serves breakfast all day (bonus) as well as lunch. It's a great brunch spot. The eggs Benedict is spot on. I can't tell what sort of herb or tweak they add to the hollaindase sauce but it doesn't taste like your typical eggs benedict. Their breakfast sandwich is tasty as well but a little bit more on the dry (and healthy) side. Their ingredients are fresh as is their produce. If they push the cinnamon roll on you it's because it's like a cinnamon god's protege and worth every calorie consumed. Plus it's flowing with frosting. Nourish has a great patio for dining as well as spacious seating inside, but the patio is covered enough that even on a hot day it's comfortable to sit outside. So in summary, Nourish is a good choice if you're looking for a healthy meal that will fill you up. I will absolutely be back and I can't wait to try some of the lunch items that looks tasty. Note: Be sure to check the times before visiting Nourish. I was surprised to find out that they open at 11:00 on Saturdays but 9:00 on Sundays.~~#~0
I'll go easy because they just opened this location.1)  The onion ring batter won't stay on the onion.  The onion was a bit raw too.  Try soaking the rings for 24 hours in buttermilk.  Then coat twice.  Season the flour with garlic and pepper.  Works for me!2)  The happy hour menu is weak!.  Pretty much chips and snacks type stuff.  Nothing good like sliders etc.3)  The kids mac & cheese is out of a box.  Really guys?  It takes two seconds to make mac  & cheese from scratch.  Go to allrecipes.com if you need help.4)  The burger meat is good in flavor but the burger lacks seasoning.5)  The menu is way too big.  A scaled down menu with better quality would be better.6)  The nachos are nasty with that queso cheese.  People love traditional nachos.  Stack them high and layer them with cheddar.  all the toppings.  You are a sports bar.7)  IMO.. drop all of the steaks etc from the menu.  You're a sports bar.  Leave that to Mastros and Flemings.  People want GOOD bar food in a sports bar.Bottom line....  love the atmosphere, food is OK, beer was cold, price is a little high for what you get, menu is too big, quality of food is OK.  What would I do?  Interview a new fresh Chef to bring in some changes.  Good luck.  I'll stop by again for a happy hour and give you another try.  Cheers.~~#~0
I don't know if it tastes like Chicago or not but it's reasonably safe to say that the stuff is cooked to order and consistently greasy and overstuffed, so maybe it is like Chicago?The atmosphere is cool I guess, but I'm a Bears fan so it's cool seeing the old memorabilia on the walls.~~#~0
Sam is da man.I was very impressed with the fare here. I had a bowl with noodles and chicken on my first outing, and it was awesome. Another time I came I felt way hungry, so I ordered the SUMO bowl. Whoa. The bowl is a 32 oz bowl, I could have had it all chicken though. The beef is meh. I agree with another yelper that the eggrolls are subpar. They are grilled I guess? I dunno, lame. At another location they had these "carnival" cookies that were awesome. Another variety of cookies were the butterscotch. OMG. Amazin. So yes... Sam is da man.~~#~0
Amanda B organized a UYE for Dim Sum here today.  They do Dim Sum from a menu instead of carts and it works really well.  They also have a picture menu to look at with many of the items on it so folks like me can have a better idea what to order just by picking the picture of stuff they liked on a prior trip.  We were pretty much the only folks there for quite a while and we had the full attention of the staff.  Not all of the staff is fluent in English but I can only recall that being a problem with the tea.  I liked my choices a bit better this time, experience helps, and Marian H was helping me with sauce pairings as there were several to choose from.I almost gave them a 4 but for the restroom.  The fixtures had a lot of corrosion around them and in general the restroom showed a lot of wear.  I flushed the urinal and was washing my hands and it seemed like the running water was very loud, I looked over at the urinal and the valve had stuck and the place was indeed flooded.  I beat on the valve with my fist until it rocked back but by that time the floor was quite deep in water.  I mentioned it to the hostess and they had someone in there with a mop quickly.I would definitely go back here again.~~#~0
Wanted Thai food near Chandler tonight but realized few are open on Sundays. Here's how the morning's research played out:1. Great reviews for Thai Rama on Yelp but no hours of operation. Strike one.2. Look for hours on restaurant's web site. Strike two. 3. Call restaurant. No voicemail greeting after 34 rings. Strike three looking.4. Discover Facebook page, which despite having just 85 fans does include hours of operation, as well as some nice feedback from patrons.5. Will try Thai Rama tonight with unfairly high expectations. Hope the food is worth all the effort it took to get the most basic information.~~#~0
I visited on high reviews.  I think it's a little over-rated, but good none the less.  My burger was a bit overcooked, food was overpriced but the service was top notch.  Great service, exciting atmosphere (although a bit cramped).  I would go again with hopes of a better burger.~~#~0
It was maybe two months after this place opened that I decided to give it a try.  I didn't go to the restaurant, opting instead to use their delivery.  I placed a large order for two (~$80) and the food was ready and delivered withing 30-45 minutes.  The food was of decent restaurant quality and definitely a good place to get steaks, but it was no where near the quality you would get from Texas Roadhouse or Outback and neither is the price.  I'd definitely recommend trying them if you are looking for a cheat, good steak fix.~~#~0
Playable muni track for players of all abilities.  If you've never played golf, this would be a good course to learn at.  For low handicappers, it's birdie paradise.  Kenny Mac has a large chipping green and two putting greens, as well as a driving range equipped with crappy range balls and mats which I refuse to use.  The course itself is wide and flat, and is certainly not a destination golf course.  The fairways have generous landing areas and the rough is hardly penal, while the greens are mostly accessible and large.  During the summer time, the fairways run out and the course plays extremely short.  Bonus 1/2 star for having lovely cart girls.~~#~0
3.5 stars. Went to the Calo Flamenco show this past Sunday, brilliantly talented company of dancers and musicians.The Center just completed a year-long renovation this May, completely refurbished all 1,500+ seats, added guardrails and orchestra level handicap-accessible seating, and enhanced their central A/C system. The Chandler Symphony offers free concerts on monthly basis. The Center's programming schedule can be found here: http://www.chandlercenter.org/performances.html~~#~0
Does YC's stand for "yucky chinese?" That's what I'm wondering as I am slowly trying to put down this food. This is such a fun and exciting concept, and the service was beyond amazing, but wow... this "food!" My sauce to meat/noodles/vegetables ratio is about 100:2. Being that you're supposed to choose your own food/sauce, including the amount, it should be my fault; however, the nice young lady who works there made my sauce. There's a menu board of how to make your sauces, but since there are two meal sizes you can choose from, I think they need to re-doctor those recipes to fit each of the sizes. I feel like I'm eating spicy soy and sesame sauce soup.  I think the price is pretty reasonable for everything you get: meal, drink, soup, great service.YC, re-doctor your sauce recipe and I may consider my return.~~#~0
Went here because of a groupon, will probably not go back without one.  Cons:Overpriced, flat out.  Plus, like other reviewers have said, they RUN OUT of a lot of good stuff.  Also, I know this is something small, but as their menu changes, they should update it online.  Had I known the menu would be so different, I would have waited for another week to get a meal I would ACTUALLY want (as opposed to settling).  Also, we had reservations and had to wait 20 minutes.  Not a huge deal, but a personal pet peeve.Pros:  The food was good, but like I said, overpriced.  Since I had a deal, I didn't mind as much.  Atmosphere is nice, and I loved the extras (we got a few small tasting, palate cleansers?).  The cotton candy was fab, and though the strawberry dessert was NOT my first choice, it was truly delicious, and I may go back JUST for that dish!  I love the location, and the staff was incredibly friendly, informative, and courteous.  Knock down the prices and I'd give it at least 4 stars!~~#~0
I LOVE in n out burger, but this particular location kind of lacks.I order a double double, mustard grilled, no onions with chopped chillies.My burger came with onions and without chopped chillies.  Also mine and my girlfriends buns were stale.~~#~0
I admit I'm not a huge BBQ fan, as it usually makes me feel like exploding afterwards but since my dining partner loves BBQ, we've eaten here a lot. The meat is pretty good but at least one of the meats has been dry each time I've been. My favorite has been the ham. The spicy BBQ sauce is pretty darn tasty too. I've found myself putting black pepper on the mac and cheese to spice it up and haven't been all that impressed with the rest of their sides either. I'm a big fan of sides at BBQ places, even more than the meat, so when sides disappoint I get sad. :(I dumped out their homemade root beer after one sip. Don't know what was about it but it was very *off for me, and I seriously love root beer. My dining partner loved it so ehhh...maybe it's just me. The place is very interesting on the inside, the decor reminds me of a mid century cafeteria but more modern. They have a huge hand painted mural of a farm and a large outdoor seating area for parents to let their kids run around in while they eat. Joe's gets packed. I've seen the line wrap around to the outside on the weekends. I don't think it's worth waiting the 20-30 minutes in line for, but then again I don't think a lot of places are worth that wait for cafeteria style dining.~~#~0
Well, it dropped a star for me, and I'll tell you why. Eaten there probably 20 time in the last quarter. I've had it all; All you can eat sushi, bowls, desert, beer. Ate alone, ate with Sandra K, ate with son and family (including 3 year old grandson who plays drums with the chopsticks) had a party of 12 there.Service....slow on Saturday for the AYES, otherwise I can't complain. There are some "bright" spots. First, it's close to my neighborhood, a start and there is more than sushi and that is helpful when you have non-sushi lovers with you. The bowls are very good and you can order them in the heat index you like. Funny names to them as well, like the "Exit Wound Bowl" or "The Classified Bowl with this description;Don't Order this Bowl".Squid Salad is great, great, great! Calamari, ok. Hey they put a lot of thought into their beer selection and that is cool. And their dessert sushis are very unique.As for the sushi....I now have way too many sushi restaurants to try and they are all falling over themselves for your business. Sushi has become really "hip" lately but there will be a fall out in this category as the economy continues to slow and people, let's face it, are pulling back. This is not a place for a sushi purist, but give me good food, a cool gathering place (close to my central Phoenix abode) and I will be there. Sushi has got to get better for me to rate higher and "earn" my business.~~#~0
Service - 5 stars (which is so rare). Food 2.5 stars. My husband and I are a little picky when it comes to steaks (we eat Morton's and Mastro's) but we wanted to try a new steakplace while visiting Phoenix and Durant's had great reviews. When you get to the restaurant, you walk through the kitchen (pretty cool to see everything) then you're greeted by the host. We came for a pretty early dinner and literally every single person - host, kitchen staff, waiter/waitresses greeted us. The decor is pretty cool - kind of burlesque-ish, all walls are a deep red, there are huge vases of roses everywhere.Our waiter Fred was awesome!! Very friendly and professional.  I had their vegetable beef soup (good but salty) and my husband had house salad. I ordered the trout with lemon caper sauce which was very bland. My husband had rib-eye and it was also bland which was surprising. Their dessert - trio creme brulee - was the best part of the meal! So from this meal we decided if we want steak, we're sticking with our usual Morton's.~~#~0
They are known for their CARNE ASASDA and it  does rock but dang this place was nickle and diming me at every turn!  Everything is ala carte, and the tacos are so small,3 bites and its done.For the price tag it should at least come with a small bag of chips.Honestly the chips were so average it was disappointing. the salsa that comes with it was mediocre considering the hold out factor applied.   The salsa that came with my  tacos was exceptional, that should be their signature salsa for everything.Sodas by the can, no refills,,geezzz,, another 3.00 bucks later.I think I ended up spending over $12 for 3 small tacos and small basket of chips, and 2 sodas in z can. For that price,  I want more atmosphere or at least a 4 bite taco.~~#~0
It is with great regret that I give House of Tricks three stars.I've been here twice.  The first time, friends invited me and the wifey here for dinner.  Seeing the patio, I thought, "oh, this is really cute."  Once seated inside, I thought, "oh, this is really cute."  Seeing the prices on the dinner menu, I thought, "oh, this better be really good."  Long story short, it was okay.  My friend, who had only been here for lunch, apologized for the unexpectedly high prices.  I didn't care too much, I guess.  It was edible.  I'd probably come back for lunch.Which I did, with co-workers in tow.  The prices at noon were certainly more agreeable and we all looked forward to a pleasant meal.  Suddenly, this gem of an exchange occurred between our waiter and my boss, Debbi:Debbi:  How large is the quiche?  I weigh 230 pounds, so I'm a big girl.We giggled.  Debbi loves to joke.Waiter:  Well, it's not as big as you.Bad form, dude.  Bad form.  You're lucky we paid lunch menu prices.~~#~0
My boyfriend, myself, and his 3 year old foster sister met up with his mom, dad, and 2 year old foster sister. We were all heading up to Prescott this past Saturday (1/30) to play in the snow. When we got there, they were already set up with drinks & pancake balls (strange, yet greasy & delicious). They'd placed our orders as well since they texted us for them when we were still 15min or so behind them. The food was good. The service was just okay this time since I can't remember if anyone ever came to give refills on anyone's drinks. I know they came by and asked if everything was okay a few times, but that was it. Still, friendly staff. The bathrooms weren't anything spectacular, but it's a bathroom...at a Denny's. Anyways, we all left full and went on about our day.~~#~0
There is a certain sense of nostalgia that exudes from Phoenix Muni that you don't really get at the newer Spring Training facilities in Arizona. True, it is the oldest still in use, but it feels more intimate and more geared towards the spirit of seeing your team before the season starts. It's less about business and more about getting back into the swing of the things, having a few laughs on the basepads and shaking hands with the people who really live and die by their fandom. Most of the seats beyond 1B and #b sides are benches, another throwback, but really, there isn't a bad seat to watch a game. Get there early if you're into meeting players and getting autographs and also be prepared to wait in lines for food or drink. Even when ALL the stands are open, they are not enough to service a packed house of hungry fans. Bring cash, only a few places accept card.~~#~0
A hand-job with gardening gloves.....I went looking for Scottsdale Auto Salon to get a hand wash tint quote on my new Mini today. Finding it out of business, I whipped out my handy-dandy Yelp iPhone app looking for a nearby alternate to at least get the wash done and found Classic Car Spa. Expecting to pay a bit more for a traditional hand wash I was surprised to find a machine assisted process. I'd spent way to long trying to locate the place (thank you Google maps) so I just opted for their supreme wash, which includes both interior and exterior detail.My son and I watched the car move through the process and saw that at least the 'wash part' was done by hand, but they used the same mitts from the filthy truck that had gone through previously. -1 starAfter seeing this, I should have watched their 'interior detail' more closely. When I got the car back there were lines of dirt in my white roof, and water spots on the accent chrome. When we got in the car there still bits of chip on the seat and floor mat from my sons spill the day, and it was obvious that the dash and interior hadn't been detailed. (Unless they refrain from using any product what so ever on the interior of the car. The dash and steering wheel were bone dry and dusty.)  - 1 starI should have brought it up to someone, but my husbands' and sons' hunger won over and we just left. Thankfully all of their other locations are to far out of the way to bother detouring to again.The staff was friendly, and their waiting area was pleasant with lots of drink choices, although I'm not sure their waiting area was comfy enough for anything longer than a wash.~~#~0
I went here last night with the BF and another couple, and we all had really high expectations for this place that just weren't met. Not to say it was bad, it wasn't, it just didn't live up to the hype. The space is very cute and warm feeling. I like how the chairs don't all match and it has a very homey feel. The service was also very good.The BF ordered their home made ginger ale and it was very interesting. It tasted like liquid ginger, which was pretty cool. For food, we started with the nosh plate, which was probably the best thing we got. It had this delicious onion jam type stuff with some crackers, cashews, some meat of sorts, and a really good cheese with dill on it. The onion on the cheese was soooo good. I could have just eaten that for dinner. Then we ordered mains. The BF and I shared the chicken and waffles and our friends got the mac and cheese and the flapjacks. I was not a huge fan of the chicken and waffles, and I was so excited for it! The waffles weren't crunchy at all, which I think would have been nice texturally, and the chicken was encased in the fried coating, but once you cut into it, the fried part just fell off. It didn't adhere to the chicken at all. Also, it was very thick and didn't have a ton of flavor. This was very strange. The sauce on the waffles was good, it was a honey butter or something, and the chicken was moist, but together, it was a disappointment. It did come with some wonderful green beans though.... they were seasoned and cooked perfectly. I tried my friend's flapjacks and thought they were a little strange tasting... but not bad. I didn't try the mac and cheese, but my friend thought it was good. We finished with a shortcake that has strawberries that were macerated with balsamic and basil and had some kind of cream in it. This was very good, I loved the earthy flavor that the basil brought to the dessert and the strawberries were flavorful and tasted fresh. Overall, it was good, but not great. Maybe I had too high expectations, but I probably wouldn't run back here in the future.~~#~0
I've only been the their location on Central Ave.  When I went to order my usual I was informed that this location doesn't have french fries.  Ok bummer... I'll get along with it.We went later in the evening and the place was really dead.  I'm sure at lunchtime its much busier.~~#~0
Went back to Liberty Market the other day and bought the Molinari pizza. A friend had complained that the outer edge always burned while the middle stayed too soft and undercooked. I like the stuff that comes on these pies, so I figured I would give it a shot.She was right. It wasn't unedible, but the middle part was pretty scary. I have no idea how they should fix this problem but this pie wasn't great even though I still love this place.Oh yeah, Joe, you also need Sweet & Lo!~~#~0
I can only give this place an OK because that's just what I have had from them so far- food that was ok, not slap your grandma good! The menu is kind of hard to understand but I know that I like chicken pho so I ordered that the first go-round and just wasn't wowed like I wanted to be. The noodles were good but the broth just wasnt to my liking. The second time I had pork noodles (dry) and it was better but still not GOOD. JD had the spicy noodle soup and that was good too, but , again, you guessed it-OK. I haven't given up on it yet because it is so close to my house and the people are so nice and friendly.  Any suggestions on what to order won't be ignored.~~#~0
Pleasant and beautiful. Feed the koi fish cheerios. Bathrooms are out of a catalog...I want that! Walk at a snail's pace, because it's not terribly large. When you're done, walk down to Pita Jungle or Lola Coffee!~~#~0
Typical chain "southwestern/Tex Mex" food in a corporatey atmosphere. They have some tasty dishes and a killer sunday brunch, but everything on the menu is kind of ambiguous.Prices here are about on par with most places of this type (I put it in the Applebee's, TGI Friday's, Charleston's, etc.) category. I enjoyed my visit to this location better than my visits to the PV and Tempe locations.~~#~0
Inexpensive for the early bird special.  $5.55 for the combination plates that include egg roll, soup, rice, and your selection.  If the food only had more seasoning or flavor?  It was very bland and flavorless.  I usually do not use soy sauce, but needed to use it to add something to my dish.  Neat features: Koi pond inside with a bridge over it.~~#~0
Super fast service of OK-tasting subs. I've definitely had better, so the signs hanging all over the place that claim that they're "gourmet" is definitely a bit of marketing puffery. Yes, it's gourmet compared to....actually, I think Subway makes a better sub, so I can't really compare it to being more gourmet than anything really. Maybe it's gourmet because they put a ton of sprouts (and lettuce) in the sub? I will give the place props for the very speedy service. I ordered my sub and it was handed to me within 1 minute. Another thing I noticed about the place was that it was filled with male patrons. If you're a single lady looking for a manly man, come to Jimmy John's.~~#~0
Good Chinese food, great value -- especially for lunch.  China Village is one of my regular haunts for Chinese food when I'm in the neighborhood.  The building may look run-down, but the food and service are good.~~#~0
I will start with our experience from the time we walked in. The customers sitting in the restaurant stared and some laughed. I guess we missed the whites only sign on the front door. However my husband and I love to try new things and don't care what people think. The hostess however was nice and pleasant. Our waiter was also great.  The food here was delicious for an appetizer we had the stuffed mushrooms which were to die for. Our main entrees were the German meatloaf and my husband ordered the tenderloin. My whipped potatoes were so delicious. The cabbage was awesome not to sweet not to salty and the meatloaf was refreshing. My husband enjoyed his tenderloin and fries as well. It was seasoned perfectly.The skinny is if you don't mind being treated like the 13th amendment was never signed by the patrons of Haus Murphy's and want some Excellent German food this is the place to go. The staff here were great though.~~#~0
tip: if ordering in the drive thru - either there is no speaker system or it's out of order - when the person wearing an apron walks up to the side of the menu and stares into your car that means "Hi, can I take your order" There was a few seconds of awkward silence and wondering WTH this person was looking in the car for before we figured out she was there to take our order :)Since moving to the west valley from southern CA we've been itchin' to find a replacement for Alberto's or Taco San Pedro. Humberto's reminds me of awesome hole in the wall type Mexican food, but unfortunately still leaves something to be desired.With that said here's info on what we had:If you're from So Cal and have had Northgate's shrimp ceviche Humberto's comes awfully close.  Verdict - Ceviche - good.Cheese quesadilla - cheesy - did the jobNachos - goodIf you've been out late partying it up and need to satisfy the munchies monster Humberto's should do.~~#~0
It's an upscale casual restaurant with nice decor- 4 star, a quick meal before or after shopping. A quick meal means only if you get good sever plus quick service.We went to have brunch on Sunday and it was pretty packed in there. After looked at their simple brunch menu, we decided to get Grilled Hanger Steak with Scrambled Eggs, and Cinnamon French Toast with Fruit Compote & Syrup($8.50). It wasn't too impressive, the food was just ok- 3 Star. I think you pay more for the ambiance than the dishes. The service was alright- 3 Star.It felt like you are in the market with chit chat and bargain noise, which i thought it was kinda annoying.~~#~0
-1*Dropped in for my 3rd visit & still no menu board or the other offerings that made them different....no cupcake, boba, etc.  Tried the pistachio fro yo & it had an artificial after taste.  Guess I'm driving back to Yogurtland for now.~~#~0
We stopped by and rode the train, which was a good history tour. We discovered the history of gold mining in the area and some of the local lore regarding the Superstition Mountains and the Lost Dutchman Gold Mine.  I would like to come back and spend more time exploring the restored ghost town.  The train ride was a bit expensive for what it was although I enjoyed the Hurry-Up Henry the conductor.~~#~0
I do love Chinese food, and for such a big city I find that Phoenix (or at least Scottsdale) lacks in options, either because they aren't the most welcoming of places, or simply because there aren't that many (compared to sushi restaurants for example. I've been to this location maybe 3 times since moving to Phoenix (8 years ago) and must say that I usually go because a friend as a "Pei Wei" craving. I found the food to be ok, but I'm typically one who doesn't like spicy food as I find it takes away instead of enhances the flavor. I wasn't too hungry and decided to take the chicken fried rice. I have to say that my favorite chicken fried rice is the one from Tottie's in Scottsdale that not only is delicious but always gives me left overs for lunch the next day. Portion was ok though the fried rice was a little sweet and the person I was dining with had the chicken lettuce wrap which wasn't too bad either. Service was disappointing as our food took about 10 minutes to come, but I must say the staff was helpful when I was asked where to get takeaway boxes as well as a takeaway cup. I'd give it 4 stars if after a handful of experiences I had Pei-Wei on my "must have" list but with Pita Jungle, Sack's , Subway, Rubio's, etc. nearby, the competition for "fast casual" is stiff and Pei Wei just doesn't cut it for me unless I really had a craving for Asian food that day.~~#~0
Went for lunch again with my wife and SIL yesterday.  Was pretty disappointed and they are losing a Star each of the last two times.  We ordered four entrees --  A combo Nam Yeung Noodle salad (I forgot the Korean name), Pork Tonkatsu, Seafood Tofu Soup, and a dinner portion of Kalbi.  We got there at 2:00 pm and we were immediately told that they plan to close at 2:30 pm even though their lunch hours are until 3:00 PM -- WTF??  So we ordered quickly.  Within a minute the tonkatsu order came out and it was cold; probably premade or something, and the meat used was very, very thin (again) so it was very dry.  The Seafood tofu soup and buckwheat noodle salad were OK.  The order of kalbi came out last, but not on a sizzling, cast iron plate, so the onions on the bottom were raw and not "grilled and caramelized".  Don't know what is going on here, but each time we go, it seems that they are slowly going downhill.  So we have decided to look for another restaurant option for Korean food in our area.Sorry for this seemingly negative update, but I want all yelpers to know of my opinions and observations.  We used to be big fans of this place.~~#~0
Good food when it's slow. Not so good when super busy. This is usually a great place to stop after watcning a show at the Harkins theater nearby. If the lot is full on a Friday or Sat night I would pass and go somewhere a little less overwhelmed. Although the service there has always been pretty good for us, the food is hit and miss.~~#~0
Went here before the Jason Mraz concert and the Rock Shrimp appetizer, beers and cocktails were very good, however the service was a little slow. I ordered the angus cheeseburger and it came with a 1000 island dressing and pickles, a glorified Bigmac, what a disappointment.~~#~0
Dropping down to three stars ... On a recent visit, I saw TWO roaches on the main floor of the restaurant. No one seemed to care, so I got up and stepped on one.  I pointed out the other, and one of the staff killed it, but they didn't seem surprised.  I know that roaches are hard to control, but having two of them wandering about in a busy restaurant just isn't a good thing. Also, our waiter was an overly chatty guy who seems to think we are interested in his voice.  They had some good staff in the past, but I suspect the owner, who likes to get drunk and hang out on the patio, gives me the impression of a guy who would be difficult to work for! The food is still decent and better than anything else I've found, but I'm looking for alternatives ...~~#~0
This place is so cool! The menus are on the walls in sharpie along with signatures from a lot of local athletes. They will not present a bill to you, but rather trust you to tell them what you ordered and pay the correct amount. The food is great, artery clogging, and comes in huge portions. I like the smothered chicken with yams and green beans, and order it every time. I always want to sleep off the rest of the day too. Saturday they do a great rib plate. Good spot for those working or living in the city.~~#~0
I don't eat a lot of pasta and I don't come here all the time.  However, I think the salad with pesto dressing and the garlic Mizithra (spaghetti with bacon, mushrooms, brown butter and cheese) are very good.  I have heard that the other stuff is good, too.  I have only been here for lunch, so I don't know what dinner is like. Sit in the trolley car -- you can ring the bell!It is located conveniently off the light rail stop at Central and McDowell, near the Phoenix Main Library.~~#~0
I stopped in on my lunch break.  The BBQ isn't bad for a fast food type of place.  I had the brisket on this particular visit.  The BBQ sauces weren't the best I've had.  If you are in the area and looking for BBQ, I recommend Pork on a Fork.~~#~0
I just don't think I'm much of a brewery gal. Granted, the beer here blows Four Peaks out of the water, but I'd much rather have a nice cocktail than chew though a specialty brew. But if beer is your poison of choice, they've got just about everything. The happy hour is kind of weak here though, with like a buck off all drafts. Thoroughly meh.You can peruse the coolers and grab a cold one or choose from 20+ drafts they have on the menu. No Bud Light here though. Sorry frat chumps. They used to have a ton of wine here as well (like, ages ago) but it has since been narrowed down to just four choices, none of which were calling my name this last go round. Their Orange Blossom wheat beer was a bit like drinking an orange creamsicle in beer form. Almost like a cider with floral notes, a light finish and a super creamy mouthfeel. (Oh yeah, bitches. I just went there.) The perfect beer for the novice drinker to enjoy. Their IPA was also pretty decent, but was more bitter than I care for, although it stayed far away from feeling like I was drinking a bottle of grassy perfume. Solid.I thought they had deals on happy hour food (again, like a buck off) but last time I went it was no dice. At least the food's reasonably priced. Tasty rueben, craptastic hummus, crispy quesadilla. The acoustics in this place are kind of shitty, so go on an off time when it won't be packed, or run the risk of smiling and nodding amicably while hearing every other snippet of convo. The high top tables are also really uncomfortable for shorties like me to sit at, but c'est la vie. My biggest peeve about this place is the gigando assy television against the wall. For a place this small, a big ass mofo tv is just  not the way to go.~~#~0
I've been there twice. Only a girl serve the table. If there are too many people,you have to wait for a long time.  We ordered the tofu soup. That was great. Others, just that taste. Not good not bad.~~#~0
La Condesa is in a rather unassuming location in Phoenix.  But has a nice atmosphere when you get inside.  The first thing I noticed was their huge salsa bar.  We sat down and were brought menus and chips.  I tried most of their salsas.  They all had their own very unique flavor.  the peanut salsa was really interesting.  My favorite was their tomatillo salsa.  I ordered the Oaxaca Mole taco and a carne asada taco.  The mole was excellent with great flavor.  The carne asada was bland and flavorless...huh?  I dumped salsa on the carne asada taco and when finished was rather disappointed in that particular offering.Also ordered their calabacitas.  They were seasoned well and tasted great.  I had a bite of my partner's pork taco and it was amazing.  I am glad we found La Condesa and I will definitely visit again to try some more of their menu offerings.~~#~0
I ordered the Peanut Panang Chicken.... I rqstd to the waitress that I wanted extra Bell Pepper. When it came, it had -NO- Bell Peppers at all.... i actually didn't realize this until about 5 mins into eating it. could not find our waitress, I waited about 7 mins, finally, I had to get up & search for her. I found another waiter & told him my problem. He took my Dish, but then came back to tell me that they are "All out of Green Bell Peppers. Would I like Red Bell Peppers". I said yes, of course.  This whole experience has put a sour taste in my mouth about this place, which is next door to the 'mediocre' Good Egg on Central.   I like Wild Thaiger on Central MUCH better instead!~~#~0
For cheap pizza, it's as good as it gets. More selection than the other cheap pizza places, and the quality is way better.  The wings are delicious also, especially the Cajun flavor!!! If your looking for something like one of the big chains, then go there, but this is good for the money. If you want gourmet pizza, then go pay for it, don't look for it at the bargain places.  I paid $29 for an XL pizza with two toppings and 20 wings, and everyone was happy!  Just know that it's really fast pizza, but it's better than the other big guys!~~#~0
It's true, there is a real bull and a slide. This place has been around forever, I think my parents used to go there back in the 70's. I can't say much about the food since I've only been here for happy hour, which was pretty decent. Their HH  included top shelf for 3 bucks and some cheap beers. They also have appetizers on the HH menu, sliders, quesadillas and potato skins, that sort of stuff.Pretty nice view and going during happy hour you can see all the people sitting in traffic on the 10 and cheers them from the balcony.~~#~0
This place was highly recommended by various websites, so I gave it a shot when I was in Scottsdale. The service was great and the food was good. We sat in the bar area which was lively. It feels like a neighborhood hangout, so everyone looked like they were friends and having a good time.~~#~0
Third time back.  This is my 9 year old daughter's favorite restaurant for special celebrations.  Maybe because the portions are sized for her.  Just kidding.  Sort of.Always good food.  Sometimes terrific.  But never consistently, hit the ball out of the park good.  The bill creeps up on you.  We can't ever seem to walk out the door with less than $80-120 bill for 2-3.  Last night, had the filet.  At maybe 5 ournces, bigger and more substantial than the last time, when I think I paid $32 for 2 ounces.  Seriously.Last time the steak was perfect.  This time, they overcooked it, but I didn't have the heart to send it back.  So my wife ate it and enjoyed it, and I got her salmon.Salmon was just okay.  BUT, the bed of rissoto, one of my favorite dishes, was delightfully rich and creamy.Overall, it's not a terrible value.  And it's a cute little french restaurant.  COMPLETELY and totally not appropriate for small children, so don't even try.  Great date place.Whatever you do, you MUST try two things:  1) Onion Tart - it's just a slice and a side salad as an appetizer, but OH what a slice.2) Berry Tart - the deserts are what makes this place go.  Save room.  Remember this:IF YOU GO TO A RESTAURANT WITH TART IN ITS NAME, AND DON'T ORDER A TART... well, what can I say.  Just don't do it.Will be back, as I always have, and will promise to only feel slightly mugged next time I pay the bill.~~#~0
3 Stars only because the house margarita and guacamole was so good.  The food was decent (fish tacos), however the patio atmosphere was a bit sad. I understand this is more of a bar than a fine dining restaurant but the patio tables had no place settings, condiments, etc... Just cheap metal tables and chairs. Also - there was no music out there, just this incessant humming of a back alley generator.  The service was a bit sporadic out on the patio as well. We were asked by three different servers if we have a server yet. Not much in the way of organization. Maybe management just hasn't gotten around to fully organizing and furnishing the patio yet. I hope they do, because they are in a great location and the food and drinks give them lots of potential.~~#~0
Saigon Nites is one of the few Pho joints on the North side of town.I ordered me a bowl of Pho as usual, but I think the waitress made sure I knew what I was ordering, so she repeated and asked "Beef Noodle Soup" ... Yes, "Beef Noodle Soup".  I forgot I'm in N. Scottsdale where culture can be lacking at times.  I'll have me a bowl of Asian man soupy stuff and some noodles - wink! I also ordered some ice coffee with condensed milk - can't have Pho without one of these drinks. Overall, the Pho is okay. I'm somewhat of a Pho Nazi and this didn't really past the test.  My ice coffee was excellent - Why?  It was served just right!  Not too strong and not too lite.  I'm really used to having it strong and simmering it off with some water to weaken it.  Not today my friends!  Service and ambience is okay.  I really enjoy the Vietnamese art here especially the portraits of the Ao Dai...Girls in Ao Dai - oh my! - Enjoy!~~#~0
Hmm...this place has a good lunch happy hour, but the choices in the menu are kindof limited.  The food isn't bad, but it's not amazing.  So, three stars for being average i guess?I do come back every so often so I guess it's a plus.~~#~0
I stayed here in March'10 and thought the place was alright, nothing to rave about but here was my experience:PROS:1.  Location was good for what I was there for (work)2.  The nightly rates were really cheap (this had to do with my company more than the establishment though)3.  Easy enough drive to/from the airport4.  You can almost bypass Phoenix altogether getting to Scottsdale.5.  Their was plenty of shopping places about a mile and a half up the road (think Best Buy, Target, McDonalds, etc...)6.  A pretty happening restaurant/bar up the street that gets two thumbs-up7.  The rooms were actually really spacious and nice...it was like having a luxury one bedroom apartment scaled down for size (full kitchen, massive bathroom, den seating area & king size bed in a comfortably sized room).8.  Hot tub was rockin' & nobody gave us a hard time about having glass bottles out there.CONS:1.  Once I checked in, I had to lug a ton of stuff over to a room in the one of the back buildings and I couldn't see my rental car (maybe I'm weird...but I like to have my car close by)2.  I unpacked and got situated to find that the internet in my room wasn't working (Must have!), called the front office and they had to move me to an entirely different room (mind you I just unpacked...AGH!)3.  I ate dinner a couple times with co-workers in their lounge, & while it was good...it wasn't great, so we all ate at the restaurant/bar up the street the rest of the time.4.  Be aware, you stand a decent chance of see spiders looming around...so you have been warned, but otherwise it's real clean.I'd stay here again pending that I got the same room rates that I did last time, but it's my understanding having talked to the girls at the front desk that we got booked at unusually low rates.***Don't get sucked into any of that "time-share" crap...they don't push it like some other places I've been...but it's NEVER a good investment***~~#~0
Firesky Resort is a marvelous place to unwind and enjoy the warm dry evening air and fire-lit torches.  Whenever I have the opportunity to stay in the Kimpton Hotel Group's locations, I always know I've made the right choice.  The hotel was beautiful, hip and inviting.  I gave them three stars because the rooms were a nice, but not fabulous, the amenities of L'occitane products definitely helped.  The restaurant Taggio was fine, wasn't spectacular and definitely was the part of the hotel which was least memorable.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  I'd stay here again, but with the expectation of enjoying the wonderful pool/cabana area and leaving the resort for dinner.  Scottsdale has so much to offer, what was I thinking....~~#~0
Having been to about ten 24 Hour Fitness locations here and in California, this location is probably one of the least impressive.  While the staff is friendly and the gym itself is clean, the facility is small and on only one floor (note that it is a 24 Hour Active, not a 24 Hour Sport), and has an industrial feel - like it used to be an old Costco.  Weird.   It's never really all that busy, so waits for machines or weights are minimal.  Gymgoers in North Phoenix will be happy to know that a new 24 Hour Fitness Sport is opening on 43rd Ave. and Bell in May.~~#~0
I usually get the Arizona Smashchicken or the Arizona Cobb Salad.  Both are always delicious!  Sometimes they are really spicy and other times not so much.  I guess it depends on who is making it and how many jalapenos get in there.   The chicken is really flavorful, unlike a lot of other chicken sandwiches/salads where the chicken is bland and adds nothing to the meal.  I think I am the only person I know that isn't a fan of the Smashfries.  They are generally tasty, but I would far prefer regular fries.  I really like this place, but its a little pricey for what you get.  Lunch for two will probably set you back a least $20... its not too bad, but your $20 will go a lot further other places.~~#~0
This bar is ok to hang out at. I think its sort of frumpy. The drinks are fine, I've never eaten there.  They have PBR there. Lots of local people mostly regulars. Anyone can go there an fit in there.  I have been a few times but it's not a place I spend a lot of time.~~#~0
I came in  on an early Friday morning to buy a dozen and a half of donuts for my co- workers. The man behind the counter found it odd I order such an amountapparently, by the way he repeated my order. In my case 1 dozen would have been too little, 2 dozen too many and I didn't want to waste any. That alrady made me feel uncomfortable. Just fulfill whatever order you get, I am customer. It was my first time here, after many, many drive by's. He asked me what flavors and suggested to make a mix, I didn't have a preference, as I just liked an assortment. Again I was frowned upon. Just give me your bestselling flavors...what's the problem. Well, I guess it was once and never again. The donuts were fresh tasting, but the service was far beyond friendly. To bad, you could have earned a new customer.~~#~0
It's the kinda place where you're certain the employees don't spit in your food.Best Taco Bell I've been to.~~#~0
The service we had was good, food was alright, the prices seemed high.  Just a sports bar.  Fine never going to again.~~#~0
Stopped in for some macaroons and coffee, the food and coffee were decent. The place itself was kinda dirty, stains on the floor, saw a couple of flies, and sat in an uneven chair.~~#~0
I'm always perplexed when the staff knows nothing about their on-line specials. This time it was the Yelp ad. Luckily it was quickly resolved by the bartender this time which was refreshing. The place it's self is a pretty generic bar. I just had a few drinks along with the Crab Cakes which were actually pretty good.~~#~0
Angela, the Nurse practitioner, was great.  baby had a gooky eye and we took her to this urgent care office to see if it was Pinkeye so it could be treated early on.  It was Friday and her regular Dr. was booked up.  Angela said there was no Pinkeye but she had pus in her ears and had a minor ear infection so she prescribed antibiotics, amoxicilon I think.  The only hitch was when the baby had her regular dr appointment the next week he said there was no infection so we were left to wonder who was right.~~#~0
Was here for a KYOT Wine-Down-Wednesday event a couple of years ago.  The bar area was packed.  Stood around waiting for a table to open up- very uncomfortable as the area is pretty small.  I remember trying the New England clam chowder.  Tasty, but it had too much potatoes and not enough clams.  Had something else, but can't recall which, and the current menu online reflects a few changes.  I do recall thinking I would like to come back and have lunch or dinner there, so I'm giving it three stars.~~#~0
Met a few friends here for happy hour.  They had $5 martinis, but that's not what I ended up getting.  They have a drink special everyday.  That day they had the Walter Crankite, I think!  It was like an appletini with cranberry juice.  We didn't order anything else.  The service was great.  Our servere was very attentive.~~#~0
While in Phoenix for about 36 hours, I lunched at Hooters twice. It was easily located across from my hotel and it was a weekend, which meant I could catch both the collegiate and professional football games as well as playoff baseball. I take Hooters for what it is, pretty decent fried food, a restaurant that caters to men, and always has a game on. This in mind, I didn't anticipate anything other then a beer and something to eat.I sat at the bar both times and the bartender, Brittany was extremely friendly and made a point to learn (while IDing) and remember everyone's name-- which I thought was a nice touch. She was always willing to change channels to make sure everyone's game was being aired which was appreciated as well. They have a good football special-- 10 boneless wings with all you can eat fries for $5.99 during any football game.  The $3.50 25oz Shock Top beers were a deal as well. It was odd for me to see a kid's birthday party in the restaurant on Sunday, but to each their own.~~#~0
Kashman's has great food but you really have to gear yourself up for the rude owner (artichoke lady) and some of the mean, crotchety ladies that work behind the counter. This is not a good place to place your order by phone. They're always nasty and short with you on the phone and then when you pick your order up, they get all bent out of shape because you have no place to stand and wait for your order. The guys and gals that bus are usually super efficient and very friendly and the food is above average. If you're looking for good food and a verbal lashing from the staff that work there, then Kashman's is your place to eat!!~~#~0
I really don't know how to rate Lolo's, because, frankly, this place killed me.  It was only temporary, but I was definitely dead, heart stopped, for a solid five or six seconds.  Lolo's is serious eats.  So good, it was just painful.  Literally.  I really don't think I can return anytime soon.  I know it's for the best.I'm nowhere near joking.~~#~0
Zoe's get's a solid 3 stars b/c they have the raddest, most sinfully delightful chocolate cake around. The best part is it's only $2.00!  The reasonably sized slice of cake totally makes up for the boring, albeit sometimes satisfying food.  The chx kabobs are pretty awesome, enough for two people.  Comes with two huge scewers of chx, peppers, cherry tomatoes... over a bed of salad and rice pilaf.  Pretty delish.  The Gruben Sandwich is also a hit.  FYI -- If you don't like Feta, stay away from this place.  They put it on just about everything.  They trully believe in that old addage, "Feta makes it Betta!"~~#~0
Taberna and Ninfa's are owned by the same restaurant group out of Houston.  Is it a coincidence that the FTR for Taberna is by someone who has only reviewed both of these spots and gave each five stars?  I think not.Here's my objective review:Taberna is in the Scottsdale Seville where Roy's used to be.  They have a large outside patio that will be great when the weather is nice.I ate lunch at the bar and enjoyed chatting with the friendly bartender.  The menu is upscale Mexican food.  I liked the basket of chips they brought out to start.  It came mixed with chips and plantains and two nice salsas.I also ordered the al carbon steak enchiladas.  They were good and spicy served with what I believe was a mole sauce.Overall the quality of the food was good but a little expensive.  I would come back, but it's not at the top of my list.~~#~0
I had lunch here and had the sashimi tuna salad. It was fresh and tasty. I also ordered the miso soup which was actually quite good. Real chopped mushrooms and scallions and it wasn't too salty. It didn't taste like standard powdered miso that you would get at an average japanese restaurant. I also tried the cucumber lemonade which was quite good. Overall the service was attentive and our food came out promptly. My coworker had the seared tuna sliders and sweet potato hash which he looked pleased with. The portions were perfect for what we were in the mood for which was just something really light. It's a great place for lunch, the ambiance is nice especially if you're sitting on the patio. I'm not a huge fan of fusion style restaurants so it gets a 3 star rating out of me, but it's a nice place for a quick healthy meal if you're in the area.~~#~0
Decent food at a good price. Bargain lunch specials in a good atmosphere.~~#~0
First I want to thank Hula for saving my date night.  We headed out for Postino Central for their wine and bruchetta special on a Tuesday and were disappointed to find out there was an hour wait.   So we headed up central looking for an alternative. I saw Hula and remembered I've wanted to try it for while, so that's where we ended up.  I started with a blood orange martini and sweet potato fries.  The martini was awesome, but I have to say the fries had potential, but they weren't crispy.  For dinner I had the Jamaican jerk tofu.  It was pretty flavorful and the corn cakes and plantains that came with it were a nice addition.   The meal was good, the service was great and the overall ambiance was chill yet urbane.  It wasn't the best place I've ever been, but I'll definitely go back. I love that there are several vegetarian options to choose from, so I'm eager to see how the other entrees turn out with tofu.~~#~0
For vegan fare, it's passable. I liked the food, but not totally in love with it. The teas were the best though, and didn't have any dessert but it sounded amazing.~~#~0
Average Cajun food, nothing special.  I came here late on a Tuesday night.  Few people there.  It's a dive of a place in a strip mall.  A bluesman was playing nice quiet blues on an electric guitar...very nice.  Kinda scruffy place with all the basic Cajun staples.  Nothing fancy.  Decent brews.  I think the bar tender was waiting tables.  I probably won't be back, but I had heard it was great and wanted to try it.  I think I like more upscale digs and fancier/pricier fare.~~#~0
I decided to give this place a whirl yesterday on my lunch about 5pm from work  the space was nice open airy the staff from front of the house to The wait staff all were very friendly linens on the tables as well as linen napkins the only thing was the menu was a little lack luster the appetizer selection was fair. Hummus,tzatziki  , served w/flat bread ,selection of olives a couple of pork belly selections I had the lamb burger I ordered medium it was served a more rare but was still good the did offer some higher priced entrees and there were other selections of burgers and sandwiches thus the name gastro pub  they had some good beers on tap~~#~0
This place is pretty good. better than average but not great. Fish fry on Fridays is ok if you like DEEP battered fish. nice atmosphere lots of TV's.Uquiel Beer on Tap~~#~0
Best time to work out at this gym is in the early morning.  Went in the afternoon a few times and it's usually packed.  This place has everything I need to work out. (threadmill, free weights, machines, basketball court, swimming pool, and sauna).  Rarely do I see any of the machines out of order/ broken.  Although the men's sauna bench was broken for maybe 2-3 months before they finally fixed it.~~#~0
We stayed at the Pointe Hilton over the July 4th weekend are were very impressed with the amazing pool facilities and poolside food service.  However, I would send caution to anyone planning to stay at this hotel: if you do not have children, this probably is not the place for you.  Screaming children swarmed every corner of this massive resort!  So if you're looking for more relaxation and less SpongeBob, I'd suggest checking out the other hotel options in Phoenix.~~#~0
The food is good, but took a while to get to us.~~#~0
I have to say I was pretty disappointed with our brunch experience here. Ok class, let's have a lesson. What makes a good, traditional, Eggs Benedict? Easy question, you say?Answer: Nice crispy, toasted English muffin, meat of your choosing (let's go with Canadian Bacon), creamy delicious Hollandaise.What am I missing, class?Ah yes, a beautiful poached egg, which bursts when pierced, spilling it's silky, golden yolk. Ok so now that we've had our lesson, let's put it into practice. My eggs Benedict was served with three quartered tomatoes, very very very crunchy potatoes with no seasoning and two eggs Benedict. One was completely missing a yolk! Bummer. When our server came over, I told him and he brought out a new one, but the yolk was overcooked. Bummer, times two. My friend also had an overcooked egg on his plate.For the prices they're charging, we should have had four perfectly cooked eggs and well seasoned potatoes. It's brunch, not brain surgery. The space is beautiful, and the server was pleasant, but I won't come back. Too many other places to try for brunch.~~#~0
Good:  22 courts, backboards, big pro shop, cold beverages, ice cream, nice clean bathrooms, nice people work there.Bad: Pro shop seems to only carry women's clothes and old old school mens cloths, the lights are the second worse in the valley (after Indian School Park)I have never paid for courts because I play on a league so I dont know about the rates.  The courts were clean and well kept.~~#~0
I like the Bamboo Club, but it doesn't seem to bode well with purists. It is a very Americanized spin on Chinese food, with some dishes it works well and others not so much. I struggle with a fierce addiction to Panda Express so I refer to it from time to time, but I feel I'm justified this time. Bamboo Club is like a deluxe version of Panda Express. In fact, their best dish is also the orange chicken, only done much more tastefully than their greasy counterparts. It's a little overpriced considering what they are offering (semi-glorified mall food) but, all in all, not bad.~~#~0
i love mac n' cheese & i love the dark.  these 2 facts make me like this place. the service was good. the prices were reasonable. they had a decent selection of craft beer & local wine. the dark colors and candles were comforting.  (however this atmosphere makes the headlights from the cars parking up against the windows somewhat more obtrusive)a solid 3 stars for me.. i wasn't blown away, but i wasn't disappointed....p.s. i think maybe i'll miss lisa g's..?!~~#~0
Nice restaurant, good food, SLOW SLOW SLOW Service.Went there with a group, and the food was all good but the service wasn't great. I ordered Chicken Katsu before the rest of the group ordered tons of Sushi...the Sushi came out slow, but no one cared. And then I realized we had been there 2.5 hours and I still didn't have my Chicken Katsu - I asked the waiter about it and he had totally forgot. I eventually got my food but everyone else was done eating - he was apologetic and we got a free dessert but it just sucked for me since I don't eat sushi...~~#~0
I visited one Sunday afternoon just to check it out in reply to an ad I saw to visit for free for (5) days. Typically, when you respond to ads like that from a gym, the staff requests your information such as name, address, & phone so they can sell you on a membership later. That was not the case with me. It was very informal. I advised I was not a member and wanted to give their place a shot. The guy in the front desk said come right on in; no personal information requested and no tour. I'm glad there was no sales pressure. I thought the no tour part was kind of odd, but after doing my walk through, I understand why. The place is not very big. They have weights and cardio machines and the treadmills each had a personal television on the machine. The whole facility appeared clean and there were free towels for the taking for your workout. The lockers in the men's locker room were really nice. They were made brown wood. You can view a sample of the interior of the facility on their website. They looked really classy, but they were not free. There were cabinets offered outside of the locker rooms that you can keep your personals in with a latch that allows you to insert your personal lock on. There was also a small room for classes.I wasn't very impressed with this gym mainly because it was very small. I came during a Sunday afternoon when most gyms don't see much traffic so I don't know what it's like during normal high traffic periods such as early mornings and after 5pm on weekdays. I would imagine that due to the small size of this gym that they cater more to the very local crowd. I wouldn't give this location a poor rating because there wasn't really anything that stood out that was negative other than the limited space and equipment. You might think of this location as the alternative to the larger chain gyms like 24 Hour Fitness, LA Fitness, or Lifetime Fitness. You can always take a look for yourself; apparently, they don't provide too much sales pressure for visitors. Anyway, that's my say on Mountainside Fitness at Bell Rd in North Scottsale next to the Ice Den skating rink.~~#~0
We've been in the market looking for a church for the family to start attending. Chandler Christian seemed to be a nice offering since they are located fairly close to the house and have a decent size to offer something for each group (parents & children).  I've gotten some good reviews from a family that I know that attends.  I LOVE that they have a service on Saturday, as that is ALWAYS a plus for me.The sermon for today was an interesting one, and it seemed to be relevant and on topic for today.  The pastor took an updated slant to the story to make it a bit more relevant to today's time.  My husband was even laughing at the pastor's jokes.  My mother-in-law even commented on how she liked the music.  I did notice that the verses that they pulled up were not the verses that I remember.  I believe it's due to them using a different version.All of this being said, the service seemed to be a good one. The signage indicated that this was non-denomination; however, the service reminded me one Baptist services from childhood.~~#~0
Ahhh... Zinc.  It's been a while since I have left Paris.  Being a resident and citizen there for so long, I would like to think I can spot a decent French fare.  I have now been to Zinc three times, every time I ordered something different, so far the food has not dissapointed as much as the prices have.  Wow.Okay, okay, you have a spot in Scottdale, it's a nice little posh area with plenty of traffic, designer furniture and nick-nack and artsy stores that typically have things that would require your to take out a 2nd mortgage to afford those things that often just gather dust, one season at a time at home.  You would think someone on that strip would be the one to say, let's have reasonable prices.  Zinc is not one of those.The restaurant has the name Bistro in it. They have folks dining out on the sidewalk, dining with noise and the occasional smell of BMW exausts...  That's beautiful and very Parisian, also very Bistro.  Here is a wake up call though... Bistros offer fares with decent prices, a prix fixe menu and simply good simple food.  The prices were incredibly high for what you do get.  Unfortunately the charm of having an outdoor patio and serving fries in fake newspaper doesn't cut it.    The Steak Frites (a hanger steak w/ fries and a brandy sauce) is a French Bistro Classic, a staple if you will and that was the only thing that was fairly prices for what you get.  But if you knew how much those cuts are to get from a supplier, you'd be asking questions about the prices even then.On two of those occasions we had cheese plates, it was more of a mix and match, you could pick from a few Chevres, Softs and hard cheeses,  they were incredibly small portions but the breads that came with the platter was very tasty, warm and fresh.  It is typically served with a ramkin of olives.So overall, sounds like I am bashing this restaurant, I am not but I am dieing to find a reason to go back because there is something good about it, the atmosphere, the lighting, the seasonal menu.  But little things keep me from enjoying Zinc.  Such as the time we sat at the secluded back part of the restaurant, the small courtyard.  Very charming, though some of the waiters, and cooks smoked right outside of the courtyard's gates.  The smell of cheap cigarettes and mumbled chatter caused us to ask for another table, when we did, we were all the sudden looked as "picky customers".  One more tip Zinc, you may want to get the mall janitor to move his trash can from the view of your utmost beatiful courtyard, such promise, undelivered due to tacky flaws that could have been prevented by an attentive manager or even a caring waite staff.Don't miss:  Dining in the courtyard, or the sidewalk.Skip: Specials that are simply trendy~~#~0
I love that walking through the doors of the Sugar Bowl is like taking a step back in time but what I don't love is that it looks like it hasn't been cleaned or had any restoration work done since the day it opened. Lets be honest though, I didn't come here for the decor, I came for the ice cream. I was very excited when I saw the sundae covered in chocolate, cherries and marshmallow creme. I love marshmallow creme and chocolate, always a recipe for success when these two ingredients are combined. Well, no luck. They were out of marshmallow creme. I got a brownie sundae instead, only ate half and decided that it was only ok. I probably won't go back to this place. There are too many good dessert options out there. Though if my friends insisted, I would more than likely oblige.~~#~0
This theatre is very conveniently located in the Arrowhead mall which of course makes parking a breeze. It isn't my favorite in town because there always seem to be tons of teenagers here (i'm sure BECAUSE it is in the mall) and yes I know if they are too loud then we are too old. In any case the theatres are busy and bustling. The concessions seem very high but I guess that is a trade-off for the convenience.~~#~0
Very nice happy hour. Its dark inside but the beer prices are good and they have free sliders, chips and salsa.~~#~0
So I'm torn on how to rate this place star-wise because honestly, there were a few things that were 10 stars and there were a few things that were 1 star. So let me break it down for you. We walked in to this cool little spot on the Sunday before Memorial Day and it was about half full. It looked like it was VERY groovy but I seriously had to use my phone to walk around because it was SO dark. We sat at the bar and not one of the bartenders addressed us for like 15 minutes. Maybe they couldn't see us? Anyhoo the wine list is interesting and I was having a hard time choosing something. The one bartender that finally waited on us had NO personality. I asked for a taste of a few things they had by the glass. They sounded very interesting but I had never heard of quite a few of them and I pride myself on knowing my wine. The first one I tried was a syrah blend that had something to do with chocolate and it was just that...too chocolatey. My friend ordered a glass of the Justin Cabernet which is always a safe bet. I then asked for the Tannat they had by the glass. It was awful. It taste like it had been opened for days. I told our personality challenged bartender and he went and tattled on us to maybe the manager? The manager then came over and was pleasant if a bit condescending at first. He said "well have you ever had a Tannat? and I said "actually, all the time, I know what they're about and that is no Tannat" he then did agree with me and said "just tell me what you're looking for" I told him I wanted a Cabernet Franc or Grenache which they didn't have either by the glass. He ended up pouring me something that really was delicious. He definitely redeemed the evening because he was professional and helpful. We then ordered the flatbread with pesto and a few different cheeses and it was seriously one of the better flatbreads I've ever had. They had two guys playing live music and they were very good. So my break down is:Atmosphere - 4Attitude - 1 except for the knowledgeable bartender, he gets a 10Flatbread - 10QPR - 10...for those non-winey's this is quality price ratio~~#~0
Sushi is absolutely nothing to write home about. They have happy hour all day everyday, which is a great way to start your night. The Korean pork tacos are bomb! Great location in Old Town Snottsdale. Love the staff and atmosphere!~~#~0
One of the reviewers said this owner wants to run a restaurant - I completely agree.  That has good sides and bad of course in short it isn't Palette  ... We stopped in for brunch last Sunday - the French Toast is Challah [which I love] restaurant-baked I think - and seemingly not fully baked - the center was dough.  The scrambled eggs were adequate - the restaurant-made salsa verde was excellent; the Schreiners sausage as expected.  That was all we had - quality not a compelling reason to return ... until the service is factored in - crisp timely and friendly.  I'll be back to try dinner.~~#~0
The Doubletree is the resort we go to when we don't feel like paying to much for Scottsdale resort.  They have good rate rooms if you are a triple A members also.The pools are fabulous just a place to go and hang out for the day if you don't fee like checking out the Scottsdale area.The bed are OK I can't say its the best night sleep, but they do serve their purpose.  The rooms could be nicer, our bathtub had slow drain so I was standing in dirty water while taking a shower.This last stay I did order room service and they said it would take 45 mins, but it took more then an hour for it to get to me and all I ordered was a salad.  They were doing some kind of construction with some of the rooms, so it was noisy during the mid day.~~#~0
We'd wanted to try this place for a while. We went there for lunch and had a cheeseburger, fries, and coke. Everything is ala carte which makes it a little pricy (came to nearly $9). The burgers are OK, not bad, but not as big or as fantastic as I'd hoped. The fries were really good though...extra crispy. The atmosphere is really relaxed and friendly. We had our 9 month old and there weren't any high chairs that we could see, so it made it hard for us to eat (one had to hold her the whole time). Overall it was a nice place but not as great as I'd expected. We will try it for breakfast though sometime because the ratings on that seem to be pretty good.~~#~0
Patio seating is lovely!~~#~0
I came out here Halloween to party, since everything place on Mill had a line we just picked this one place to party for the night. Drinks are cheap, I was shocked at how low the bill was at the end of the night after buying rounds of drinks until our party got their buzz on, but maybe its just me used to Hollywood prices. T_T Out in LA you get used to paying for parking, cover and then exorbitant prices for drinks.  I love their signature cherry vodka drink, its tasty! Its kinda like a Shirley Temple?! Service at the bar was quick for the amount of people there. Plenty of room for dancing which is always a plus.~~#~0
I had the Soppressata with Aged Provolone & Roasted Peppers.  It was a solid sandwich overall.  The quality of ingredients was pretty good, but the only part that gets me is the price. $8 + tax?  Wow all that "supply and demand" stuff I learned in Econ class wasn't a joke.  Worth trying once, but I don't think this is a place I'll be grabbing lunch at on a regular basis.~~#~0
Great sushi, not so great on speed. Cute place, friendly staff. Try the Vegie Goyza, it is great. Sushi rolls are a bit large for one bite. Asked if we wanted a Tea refill as we were leaving. Huh?~~#~0
The food...delicious. The atmosphere...relaxing. The service...pretty spot-on. The pricing...ehhh, not my thing here. The only way I was able to eat here was because a family friend treated my family out. But if you're looking to spoil yourself or anyone you know, with food, this is the place to do it. I ordered the Chicken Romano (pan-seared with a blend of romano cheese & panko breadcrumbs, with lemon shallot butter, tomatoes, asparagus & yukon gold mashed potatoes). The chicken pan-seared with bread crumbs was great to eat, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.The asparagus... I've had better, but the yukon gold mashed potatoes were silky, buttery and made perfectly. They went well with the chicken romano.My dad ordered the NY Strip, and they were kind of enough to cut it up for him since he was handicapped. They checked up on us frequently. THE ONLY THING I WOULD COMPLAIN ABOUT WAS THEY ACTUALLY CAME UP AND ASKED IF I WAS DONE (ALREADY GRABBING AT MY PLATE) WHEN THE FORK WAS STILL IN MY MOUTH BECAUSE APPARENTLY I WAS STILL EATING. Since that ruined my entire experience thus far, I just told them to take it.In addition, the entire table got an order of the unlimited salad bar. The salad bar was great, but nothing like the choices offered at Souplantation. Also, because I ate the salad beforehand, I wasn't able to finish off the main entree I ordered. Will I be back? Probably not.~~#~0
If you have ever eaten at an exceptional German restaurant, you will be ruined for life. Years ago, the Haus would have gotten 4 stars. But after being turned on to a little gem in Gibson City, IL called "The Bayrn Stube" my appreciation of fatty meat and spices stuffed in an intestine laid on a bed of sauerkraut and red cabbage has been forever changed. Haus just doesn't quite measure up. The cup of soup before the entree tasted like it came out of a can and the bread looked like the sheets of Hawaiian bread you buy at wally world. Probably the biggest turn off was when they brought out the brown mustard still in a plastic squeeze container. My meal was the Nuernberger/Kassler combo for one, and I had enough left over for breakfast the next day. Their sausages seem to be of lesser quality than I would get at Sunflower and the red cabbage had some pork gristle in it. Not that I mind a little pork fat in my cabbage, but not chunks, and definitely not gristle. My friend ordered the Huehner (Chicken) Schnitzel, which had a very good flavor, it was the best part of either of our meals. They do have a nice selection of good beers on tap, no Aventinus though. If the food was anything other than German, it would get 2 stars. It is nice to have somewhere to get a schnitzel when I'm in the area, but I wouldn't drive out of my way to eat here.~~#~0
These folks pour a DRINK for $3 on Saturdays! They have daily specials and the Saturday special is $3 SoCo or Three Olives. Saturdays also offer a turkey cheeseburger and fries for $5, but I didn't try it. You can see all their specials by hovering your cursor over the day of the week on their home page (http://www.16th.st/index.html)It was NOT crowded when we cruised in for the Sun Devil game this past weekend. We were greeted by a guest who asked if we had a reservation and then hollered to the waitress who said there may be a wait. At least they have a sense of humor!The advantage for us was we got to take our pick of the TV we wanted to view the game. There were two Texas Hold 'Em poker tables going (not my thing so I don't know specifics) and I saw pool tables in a separate area -- photos on the website make it look like there's shuffleboard too.Definitely looking forward to going back. It was a great place to watch a game. I'll have to try the food next time and maybe they'll get a bump to 4 stars (although, I observed their nachos are real cheese nachos, and I'm a fake cheese nacho girl so I'm gonna have to pick another game day food!)~~#~0
ok experience, just got to a point I did not want my membership anymore and it was complicated to stop it all. I just did not like the autopay committment.~~#~0
I have to say i avoid this store as much as i can. I have lived in this same neighborhood for 15 years,so i have had to go to this store many times over the years. They just never understand Customer service at this location.  It is very close to where i live but, i would rather drive a little further for fresh and Easy. However, i this night i thought i would just stop here for a quick shopping experience.                                                           My boyfriend was really sick and i wanted to take him some fresh Chicken soup that they make and sell here. So here i am at 6:45 at night on a weekday. One cashier is open ,yes only one in a store that size!!!   Mind you the store is packed.  The line is all the way down the frozen food isle.   There are 4 registers where you can check your self out / But, no one is there to help them( all 4 busy)..    And it is winter in molasasville. So slow. I am sorry and don't want to sound like i am above it all,but i do not have time to waste like this.                                                                         This is not a one time  experience either. This is one of the biggest reasons i hate going to this store. I have been to other Safeways around the valley that are not like this.   The one on 7th Street for instance. They never behave this way.   Sorry to say i will continue to avoid this shop!!~~#~0
I'm used to Ranch 99 back in Northern California, and this supermarket wasn't anything spectacular. This is a good place if you want seafood! All of the traffic was around that area. The food from the take-out section didn't look too good.The market also has the bakery, peking duck, the flattened 1/2 duck, and roasted chicken. There is also Hong Kong Express to-go food where you can order noodles, dim sum, congee, boba drinks, rice dishes, etc. It's right next to the take-out food. The most interesting part of the supermarket was the selling of Chinese pancakes in front of the store. You can order mini pancakes with either a red bean, coconut, or custard filling. Each pancake is made to order and is $.50 each. I tried both the custard and red bean pancakes and it was pretty good! Cash only payment for the pancakes. You also have to wait awhile for the pancakes since there is a long line.~~#~0
A pretty big group of us came here for my bro's bday and had a good time.We had made reservations for a Sat night, and when we arrived, we were immediately seated.  Our server guy was friendly, quick and did a great job of attending to our large party.The ambiance was more relaxed (and less pretentious) than I had expected (considering you're in Old Town Scottsdale), so I appreciated that.  Parking was easy.. not sure how we lucked out on great parking spots on a Sat night in the area, but we did!The food:My sister's coconut fish was very tasty.. addictive probably because of the creamy coconut milk and the sugar they obviously added.. still delicious.My pork lettuce wraps were tasty and I had the option of getting them with red/purple leaf cabbage, which was a nice change.  The meat was savory and seasoned well and my portion was so big, there was no finishing it.My bro's seafood curry was a hefty portion (as were all the rest of the dishes in our party) but I wasn't a big fan of the flavor.My hubby's spare ribs were overly-flavored (yes, that does exist) and I didn't enjoy the bite I had.Im not sure how authentic this Thai food is, but it was tasty... Thai food is quite healthy (yes, I do believe coconut fats are healthy), but all the sugar added for flavor enhancement of the currys is not very Thai.. nor appealing to me.  For a once-in-a-while occasion, I'd go.. but it's not really on my "must go back" list, sadly.~~#~0
Good flavors, fast service.  Love their green curry.  Great happy hour where appetizers are 1/2 off the reg price.  The downside is that most of the appetizers are deep fried.  I like lunch better than dinner as they offer a nice salad with the meal.~~#~0
I've been frequenting this Savers since the day it opened a few years back... They have a great one dollar tag sale on Mondays which is pure bliss I tell you!! Having a tough week, head over to Savers with a 20 dollar bill on Monday and you will come out a new woman with a new wardrobe!! My mother is the one who actually got me hooked on this deal lol.. The original frugality of the family lol. Overall, I cannot give this thrift store five stars just because I am a thrift store whore and have visited about every thrift store in and around the Phoenix area and have plenty of experience with many other thrift stores. This Savers requires a lot of digging, but some of my best finds have been a Dooney and Bourke gently used wallet for $16.00. Banana Republic black sling shoes for $5.99. Brand name NEW work out clothes and plenty of NEW with tags vintage dresses all under $9.99. This Savers is okay for just cheap everyday wear, other than that you won't find many unique and extravagant pieces here. Also, for some reason, everyone that shops here is really nice and friendly, no competiveness at all :)~~#~0
Appears to be CLOSED.Phone number not in service. Went by last week & was all locked up with a realtor sign on the building.~~#~0
Friendly staff and clean office.From what I have seen, somewhat frequent turnover with the Dr.'s I've had.Right now I have Dr. Susman, she's concise, to the point, compassionate, easy to understand.Oral surgeon Dr. Lillien does his job well, I got my wisdom teeth out without complications or infections later.Healed up pretty well.Scheduled out pretty far so difficult to get an appointment in if you have specific avail abilities.Certain staff could use more training on procedure and techniques to expedite the process and minimize x-ray radiation time.Julie is doing a breast cancer walk, so donate (personal check) and get teeth whitening kit for 99 dollars.About staff:Kendall is very friendly and professional.Noreen seems like she could use more training (quite a few x-ray retakes with bite tabs), but she was friendly overall.The process took a bit longer than I anticipated.Suggestions:Train the staff thoroughly, with technique and procedure so it can speed up customer service. especially with bite tab as well as the other kind (the red circular one). Customers like to minimize their radiation exposure time : )Clean office and helpful reception staff. Dr. Susman was to the point and very clear about wahts going on and what to do next.downfall:Scheduling can be somewhat difficult if ppl have specific avail abilities but in general, reception staff is very helpful~~#~0
Every time I visit my parents, I pass this place and see a long line of cars. Curiosity (and a good set of luggage my parents found here) finally convinced me to stop by. Well, it's a flea market. WYSIWYG. There's the good (nice luggage, some nice jewelry, some good foodstuffs), the bad (the same "authentic" Southwestern stuff you find in any gift shop from San Antonio to San Diego), and the ugly (several "I [heart] Columbus" Beanie Babies). I'll come back if I'm looking for something in particular (chiefly luggage or salsa) or want to get a souvenir for a relative I don't like very much.~~#~0

I stumbled upon this Friday's while walking around Phoenix on a Sunday afternoon.  I wanted to just go up and have a drink and then take some pictures of the empty baseball field.  Phoenix was completely empty!When I got closer to Chase Field there were some more people and I realized that there was a game going on!  I didn't think I would be able to get into Friday's because of the game; however, it wasn't very busy!  I sat at the bar since I was by myself.  But once I was there awhile, I noticed there were still tables open looking out into the ballpark.  So basically you get to watch the game for free as long as you are ordering stuff.  I thought that was pretty cool.As for the food/drink...I ordered a daiquiri when I sat down.  It was pretty bad.  Almost too slushy.  I looked through the menu and asked if they had any smaller portions or lunch portion.  I was told that since it was a game day they have a different menu and everything is larger.  So I didn't order any food.The service was good.  The waiter was nice and another waitress named Kimmy even came up and talked to me for a little while.  I'd definitely come here again just for the view.~~#~0
Traveling sure makes me hungry! After a long flight from Chicago I was just about to break into my 3rd bag of pop chips when it was time for lunch. Hooray!I joined the infamous Lindsey F and Gabi M for lunch here at Daily Dose. When we walked in Gabi told me it was a 3 star restaurant. I wasn't sure why we were eating at a 3 star restaurant when surrounded by so many fabulous dining establishments, but any food would do.We were able to grab a table immediately, the menu is pretty extensive and our waitress was friendly. But yep..3 stars. My rock shrimp tacos sure beat another bag of pop chips, but weren't anything special.  And the friendly waitress forgot about our hummus appetizer.If I was in the area I wouldn't hesitate to grab a quick bite or drink here, but nothing here to hop on a plane back to Phoenix.~~#~0
Food is good. Don't take kids though.Kids pasta was $7 with no accompaniments.~~#~0
Decent upscale place in Tempe.  Great ambiance outdoors on the patio.  Service is very sketchy...sometime good, sometimes bad, never great.~~#~0
I went there on March 7th in the late afternoon.  My friend ordered before me and got a burger meal.  AND THE POWER WENT OUT RIGHT AS I WAS ORDERING!!  My friend ordered about 5 minutes before me so I got to eat some of her steak fries....the were awesome!!  Other than that not much else to say.  Gotta try them again some time.  The Nutter Butter Shake looked full of calories but delicious.  Better luck next time!~~#~0
I have been to this restaurant several times.  I can say it has been better each time with the first time being absolutely terrible.  Why did I return?  Because I was with a friend who wanted to try it and I couldn't believe it would be so bad the second time.  It was a bit better and most recently it was good.  The hostess initially was very "French" in that she was affected and snooty and yes, a young American woman.  Initially we had a very bad experience with a fire alarm that continually went off, the staff didn't apologize and did not comp us anything.  Other diners just left without paying or waiting for their meal.  It has since been better, but I certainly am reluctant to return.  There are many other restaurants from which to chose!~~#~0
Yelpers prove to be right yet again with the average 3 stars on this one... I was craving sushi and had a hot date with my sister-in-law last night to do dinner and a movie... It just so happened that Eat Pray Love was playing at the Tempe Marketplace Harkins Theater, so we decided to meet at Kabuki before the movie.  I walked in first and asked how long the wait was for two... I as told 10 or 15 minutes.  Not so bad... so I decided to wait.  I walked outside and met up with my Alexa and we came back in about ten minutes later... As we did so, two other women came in and I saw that they were seated right away.  I looked at Alexa, looked up at the hostess stand, was thinking (WTF), and then went and asked nicely where we were on the list.  "There are two tables before you," I was told.  "It will likely be another ten minutes or so." At that, I responded, "is there another option, perhaps sushi bar, that I don't know about?"And alas, there sure was... (they neglected to give me that option when I originally checked-in).  We were seated at the sushi bar at that moment and went on to have a very underwhelming meal.  Here's why:-While the large portion cucumber salads we ordered were extremely tasty, the cucumbers were cut lengthwise in such a way that it was difficult to eat.  I prefer cucumbers diced in smaller pieces so they are easier to eat!-Service - our waiter wasn't the friendliest... I felt kind of rushed by him when we were there.  Additionally, since we were seated in the middle of the sushi bar, all of the wait staff would reach over us to pick up the sushi for their tables, which was very distracting while we were eating!  Perhaps they could've moved the sushi ready for pick-up to the side of the sushi bar to avoid distracting guests in the future?-The sushi itself was good; not amazing.  We had a Sunset roll, a Lotus roll, a Large roll, and an order of Ikura.  I didn't realize the Lotus roll was going to have a ton of mayo along with the baked Lobster that came on top of it... it was a bit on the creamy side for my liking.-To top things off, when the bill came, they overcharged us... a simple mistake, but given our experience, it was just one more negative thing... and then when I pointed it out, I barely got an apology at all.With so many other restaurants to choose from in the Tempe Marketplace, I am not sure I'll return to Kabuki.  If I do, however, I will wait for a regular table!~~#~0
Decaf coffee was the best thing going here. Big cup, super hot and tasty.  White flannel hash was a miss. For me the flavors were off. Too much salt and way too much garlic, for my taste. Service was polite but a bit slow for how empty it was. If you like garlic and a heavy hand with salt, this might be your place.~~#~0
I was not impressed. For a business traveler, there are better choices nearby. When I drove up, the valet told me there was no self park, but I could see it less than 100 yards away from my room. I used it during my stay, and it was convenient and much less expensive. The entry of the hotel was constantly blocked by party goers, and I couldn't find any alternate entrance/exit. My bill was wrong at checkout. They adjusted it, but then mysteriously placed an additional unauthorized charge of $13.94 on my credit card. Seriously wishing I opted for Embassy Suites across the road...~~#~0
What vegetarian goes to a place like Logan's Roadhouse? The kind that will sacrifice herself for the sake of her people because she drove all the way from San Diego to AZ at midnight and had no kind of sleep, but still managed to get there and say, "Hey, I'm taking all you fools out to dinner, my treat, where do you want to go???"And, they picked this place. Oh woe is me. If you've been to Texas Roadhouse, then you've been to Logan's Roadhouse. I'm pretty sure it's the same damn place. Peanut shells on the floor, MEAT and potatoes galore, and loud people everywhere--Which is fine, because my people are very loud. The overloaded mashed potatoes was a hit, I was pissed that they were out of onion petals, and our waitress seemed really confused. But, she was nice, so I can't really talk too much crap. As long as everyone in my party had a good time, I'm happy.~~#~0
A timeless classic a place with more shows than I can / care to remember.Seen a lot of up and coming people here as well as some pretty good regular nights as well.Always an interesting collection of different music styles mixed in with a ton of talents of all sorta both local and elsewhere.Cheap drinks and plenty of pool tables.Old school video games and of course dartsPizza and bar food that is actually decent!~~#~0
I want very badly to love this bar.  I really do.  It has all the promising combinations of qualities I look for in a local locale.  Great beer.  I have no qualms about ordering the French Canadian Hefeweizen (that I can't even pronounce, spell or at this moment recall) with one glass all to myself and lick my lips at many other brews on the menu.  Add a wine list beyond belief and liquor if its your poison too.The proximity to my own compound and the blossoming bud that is the central Phoenix renaissance  is always worth a gold star; why commute when staying local is a better option?The staff and owners of the Sidebar are fantastic.  From my induction many months ago they sling the drinks with pride and the effort in the setup and delivery of the place doesn't go unnoticed. The decor is where things start to slide.  Not because the place is hovel, far from it.  Everything is crisp and new.  From the hydraulic bar stools, to the multicolored ambient lighting to the comfy lounge couches, to the super clean bathrooms; this place is a slice of upper crust for those of us who don't normally even thing to nibble from such a decadent pie.  Herein lies the problem or as my former boozing partner visiting from his new digs in Portland put it, "I'd like to see this place with about 10 years worth of dust on it."  Not my style, but I dig it and Phoenix sure as hell needs a place like it.In the end I will go back and don't mind in the slightest having a place like Sidebar to show off to East Valley dwellers and Scottsdale brats, but every time I reach for the front door I pause and am sad.A mere few feet away lies the corpse of the beloved Emerald Lounge.  A dark, seedy, dirty, smoke filled haven of locals, live music, art and personality that is now nothing but a painted over ghost.  So please, support your local bar, bring your friends and keep the sidebar real.  But remember to pause for a moment of silence and drink one to the ghost below your feet; us locals will thank you.~~#~0
I feel like Top's has been getting angrier and more bitter over time.  I called on Fourth of July just to see if they were open and they guy on the other line told me, "Yeah and we're a madhouse.  Each minute I spend on the phone with you is another body out the door," and hung up on me.I wanted to call back and tell him, "You know, the amount of time that it took you to say that, you probably lost two bodies out there door.  You could have just said, 'Yes we are!' and that would have sufficed.  Instead, you had to be snarky so I'm calling you back specifically to waste your time."Instead, I'm just going to Yelp about it.On multiple occasions coming back over the past few months, I feel like I'm tip-toeing through the house when someone's mad at me.  I don't get it.  There's a serious vibe of negativity going on.  Specifically, the guy who acted like a fuckface over the phone has been snarky and bitchy a few times to me.  Oh, and refrigerate your fucking beer.  I'm tired of having to pop my shit in the freezer for 45 minutes cause the beer or champagne I buy is piss warm.~~#~0
I've been eating here for years off and on.  I used to live close by and went often.  The quality of the food started to go down and we stopped going.  Then they changed owners and it's ok to eat there again.  Flamingo Palace is just what you'd expect from a strip mall Chinese restaurant.  The food is so-so and the service is pretty good.  We really like the hot and sour soup and the Flamingo chicken.  I can say that through the many, many times that I've been to Flamingo I've never had an experience that made me NOT want to come back.~~#~0
Nice park. But people need to keep an eye on aggressive dogs. My 4 month old puppy was beat up by another dog this morning. 7-7-2012 We were the first ones out there this morning, around 5:15am We were just out there walking around, This lady and her grey/ and white dog. Was walking around. Then the dog came up to us for no reason, and jumped on my puppy just started beating him up. The owner didn't even do nothing.. The dog was almost killing my puppy. I yelled at the dog tried to stop him. Then he attacted me. Bit me very bad on left hand. The owner  asked me where I was going I said west valley hospital. I was very scared. She said she would meet us @ the Hosiptal. I never saw her show up.. Those kind of Aggressive or angry dogs shouldn't be allowed out there. Yea go at your own risk. But people should not let angry or aggressive dogs out there. The owner didn't even say sorry or give me her name, nothing.  Shame on her. And her aggressive dog.  I hope she teaches that mean old dog some manners...   Brenda Hansen... The Hosiptal visit was long. But west valley took special care of me.. Thank you Hosiptal~~#~0

You are seeing a continuing trend here. When it first opened it was a 5 star place but since then the pizza has been inconsistent and going down hill. The last pizza I ordered, the crust was soggy and it had too much yeast. The cheese was also too rubbery and tasteless.I grew up watching 90210 like many of us "old folks." They had the Peach Pit. Do you remember that place. Well Jimmy and Joes is the pizza version of the Peach Pit. Yes, me and my 30's felt age inappropriate when I arrived. And I immediately felt like I was in high school again when I went to grab a tiny ketchup cup to grab some wing sauce and they said it was 60 cents. Another person walked in and they gave him a hard time because he didn't have his coupon on him even though he read the coupon code over the phone. It had that high school vibe..you know the one I'm talking about the..."I owe you 3 dollars and I'll pay you back tomorrow." vibe.  That vibe is felt when you park there. There is limited parking as it is and whatever parking they have, there are signs that limit you to 20 minutes parking almost implying they don't want you to eat there. I was too afraid to take napkins because I'm sure it had some price or limitation attached just like everything else there.I've eaten here several times and I've reached this conclusion: eat at the place but don't pick up pizza here. JJ specializes in the one slice and drink. Their short slices are done well and if you don't eat it hot when it comes right out of the oven, it loses it's flavor fast. I've picked up pizza and it's almost like two different pizzas. When I picked it up, the cheese was exrtremely rubbery and the crust was so chewy like steak. This is a great place for a short lunch or a business lunch but I wouldn't order several pies if I was hosting a Superbowl party or had people over.~~#~0
In the age old debate of length v. girth, Sky Harbor is clearly a proponent of length. I swear this airport is three miles long. And if you have a connection... well, good luck running across the entire airport from people mover to people mover. It's one long, long, long, long, line of hallways and people movers. Over and over and over and over again. But... they've got free wifi! ...oh, that only works about 60% of the time. Well, it'll do. They do have clean-ish bathrooms and loads of options as far as airport eateries go. But if you take one thing away from this review, let it be this: Length isn't always the answer.~~#~0
After a business trip, I reeeeeally needed a massage. Facility was alright. I personally think it needs an upgrade.  Right off the bat, the area with the lockers (and really where you would get nakey!) is very public...that's the first area that everyone walks through.The outside lounge area was also VERY tiny.  I went out there and walked right back in because it was full with little privacy.  By that I mean I walked out there and BAM!  A large naked woman scared me back inside.  Really?  G. D. people!  I'm trying to relax.  Naked out of shape people stress me out!  Just ONCE, I want to see a naked hot person walking around.  And if a woman goes nakey, do some basic maintenance first although that much hair does prevent seeing everything, so it may be a blessing...ugh, you know what?  Just stay clothed.  Please?But my masseuse totally made up for that.  60 minutes of amazing...I forgot all about business and naked people who should be naked in private! 3 stars because Joelle worked magic! She was great and super friendly.  Even though the facilities weren't the best, I would consider returning for her massage.~~#~0
This place was just okay.  While I can't claim to be an expert in Korean food, I am used to the Korean bbq restaurants in Los Angeles and I can say that this place cannot compete with those restaurants.  First, they didn't seem to have the proper ventilation for Korean BBQ.  I have never been to a place where you could see smoke throughout the restaurant from people cooking at their table.  Second, the service was AWFUL.  It took them forever to just greet us and bring us water and the fact that it was toooo HOT in there did not make us happy to wait 15 minutes for our water or for someone to even acknowledge our presence.  The food was decent but the seafood pancake was super disappointing.  They didn't even chop up the green onions that they put in it (seriously, like entire stalks of green onion) and it had no seasoning...  I may give this place another shot but as for now, I'd give them 2.5 stars if I could.~~#~0
Great service. Good food. Had baked scallops. Reasonable prices~~#~0
Everything was average.  Fairly clean place.  Banh Xeo had to much bean sprouts.  The proportion of veg to meat was off.~~#~0
I'm gonna have to hide this review from my girlfriend who is from Wisconsin and a big Brewer fan. To be honest, this is my least favorite stadium to go to because of its location and just overall mediocre atmosphere. It has an outfield grass area, but it is kinda boring. Maryvale is a no frills ballpark, so if you are going to a Spring Training game to actually watch some baseball, this is the stadium for you. If you want to go for the game, the scene and overall experience, I'd recommend a stadium in Scottsdale. For what it's worth, a friend of mine says this is his favorite Spring Training stadium, but frankly I think he feels that way since it was the one stadium he actually played in while in college. I personally like to go to a game and then head over to some bars or restaurants, but at this stadium I check out the game and then get the hell outta there!~~#~0
I don't know why it is that all these airports have such a major lack of seating.  The staff here are friendly, and security is quick, but I just wish they'd work on the gate areas and add more seats.  Need an example?  Sacramento International's new terminal.~~#~0
I'm sure this is a lovely Spa and Resort; sadly I was here for a conference.  Being the good worker I am, I did not see the pools, spas, or golf course.  I saw the conference rooms, my hotel room, and the restaurants.  I have to say the hotel rooms were nice, very large, each with a little patio.  The restaurants ands bar are all super expensive and not worth the price - but if you are sans-car you are trapped.  The saving grace here is the little 'coffee shop' by the entrance.  There they have very tasty sandwiches and beverages for a decent price - grab some eats there and go sit outside or on your patio.  You'll feel trapped on the complex...18 bucks will get a town car to take you to Old Town.  To get back to the hotel, go into a restaurant and ask them to call a cab for you...its hard pressed to find cabs on the street (least it was in the afternoon where I went into town).~~#~0
Great place to grab some quick groceries.~~#~0
We ordered from here the first day in our new home, also the first NFL Sunday this season. I was expecting about an hour wait. They quoted me 45 minutes for delivery, and when the doorbell rang after 20 I thought it was solicitors or perhaps neighbors coming to welcome us into the neighborhood. I was pleasantly surprised that it was our food. We ordered a mushroom pizza (meh), and wings and chicken tenders - both very tasty. We're used to more thin crust pizzas, NY style I guess? so this was a bit doughy, but the garlic herb crust was yummy nonetheless. Not sure if we'll order from here again, unless we don't find our NY style place, but it was still good.~~#~0
I've eaten breakfast here a few times and always thought the food and service were good. I think the prices are reasonable. My only complaint is the place is too small. there have been many times the hubby and I go there and there is simply nowhere to sit, so we end up leaving. I wish they would expand the dining area as I would love to eat here more. I hate chain restaurants, but when this place is too crowded I end up at a crappy chain.~~#~0
This is the place to go in Scottsdale for an Italian beef.  When I visit Chicago I usually go to Al's or Portillo's for Italian beef and having Al's here saves me the trip to the Windy City.The decor here is nice with several motorcycles displayed throughout the restaurant for some reason.  It's neat and clean and plenty of helpful employees provide relatively quick service.I ordered the regular Al's beef with sweet peppers.  I usually don't order my sandwiches "wet" because they come with plenty of juice already.  Good flavor and just the right size.  The fries were thick but a little greasy for my taste.All in all, a good lunch and a place to keep in mind when I'm feeling like a taste of Chicago.~~#~0
The bf and I wanted to try someplace different on our venture out to North Scottsdale so we decided to give Coal Burger a try.  The menu is pretty small, which isnt good or bad.  I had the green chile burger and my bf had the bacon blue burger and we shared a side order of mixed fries.  The burgers were not bad but not great.  The flavors were pretty well mixed together but the burger itself was just blah!  The fries were ok as well, nothing special.I would go back to give them another try.  They have interesting sodas on tap that are natural.  The shakes look good so will try those the next time I am in the area.~~#~0
Food was tasty. I ordered the veggie combo, and was a little disappointed that it didn't come with more of a variety of things, especially for $12. BUT what it did come with was good.~~#~0
Not quite hot sex on a platter but good food, yummy beer and great music go a long way!~~#~0
Simple, Inexpensive and within walking distance from my place. I went biking this evening and had the sudden urge to get Chinese food.I ordered something to go and got a vegetarian dish with tofu. From what I've observed, the place is simple and clean. Now as far as my dish goes; I thought it was good, but needed more flavor.  (which is a good thing)It gave me a good reason to infuse my dish with Bragg's Liquid Amino which is healthier than other seasonings. My only complaint is the edename in the vegetarian dish. Why do they have to include the shell? I don't like unwrapping them with my teeth!  ;-P                 |                 |  /                 | /   . .~^(,&|/o.

My biggest tip for newbies to YC's, look toward the grill and look up.  There you will find a nice little menu of sauce formulas.  Unfortunately, I never looked up.  As a result, I didn't have enough sauce.  In my case, that was a good thing because the sauce I did have tasted like crap, so more of the same would have been even crappier.As for the ingredients, lots of choices with fresh veggies.  I have to say the meat looked unappetizing to me.  In fact, I had to ask my husband what the hell it was.  I guess it's a good thing you don't see piles of freshly sliced meat, else it might not be so fresh after all.  But in its frozen to minus 500 degrees F state, I found I opted for more veggies.Two sizes available.  I went with the large, crammed my bowl full until it resembled a small mountain, and then wasted over half of it.  So get the small unless you want leftovers or you haven't eaten in several days.~~#~0
This Mimi's is near the Reach11 complex where we were attending a tournament.  So, afterwards, we came here.The short version is that this is just like the Mimi's in Chandler.  The food is fine.  Not great, but fine.  The service was OK too.  Everyone enjoyed their food (I had the chicken pot pie).  None of it really struck me as "French", which is Mimi's motif, but it was good.  In fact, the kid had chicken picatta, which is Italian.  Not French.  They do have quiche, so maybe that's enough to claim to be a French-like bistro???  (Not in my book, honestly.)Anyway, I'd call this place average.  Really, I should give it 2.5 stars, but that's not an option with Yelp.  An OK place to stop if you're in the area and looking for food.  You could do much worse.~~#~0
I really wanted to fall madly in love with this place, I mean, a British themed pub in Heritage Square? So promising. As you walk in, the bartender is standing behind in an elaborate wooden bar structure. This made me think publican instead of bartender (as in "Mate, I'll take a pint and d'ya have any rooms available?"), which is probably the idea. As there was nice selection of draught beers, we walked around to the bar to the right and ordered a couple of pints. I ordered a Boddingtons, my friend ordered a Stateside micro brew. (Would have been nice if they had Old Peculiar on tap, but you can't have everything.) Due to the combination of things cooking in the kitchen, it smelled a bit like my grandma's house. This prompted us to make a beeline for the patio decorated with super-heavy wood furniture. I assume this is to discourage thieves from selling their tables and chairs on the black market. Smart. The piped-in music selection that night was a bit off-putting, in fact, one of the other patrons commented on it as well. It appeared to be a satellite radio station that specialized in 80s hits like Wham! and Depeche Mode. I guess George Michael and David Gahan ARE British. Indeed! Wikipedia just informed me that "Dave Gahan (born May 9, 1962 in Epping, Essex, England) is the baritone lead singer for the English electronic band Depeche Mode, and is also an accomplished solo artist." Now I feel better. There are many cozy nooks in this place, so that would be a good thing if you wanted to have some one-on-one time. They were also playing football (soccer) on the flat screens, so should make some team scarf-wearing Brit ex-pats in the Valley very happy.Will I be back to try the food? Probably at some point. But, for another round of drinks, I think I'll wait for a Friday or Saturday night when it's hopping.~~#~0
If I could there would be two reviews here. The golf course its self would be an easy 4 star based on price and condition. Customer service would be a 1 star. Don't bother trying to be friendly with the pro shop staff, these folks are just going to through the motions of taking your money and doing the least possible to get their paycheck. But since the golf is such a great value and people will continue to flock to this place in droves I don't see them needing to hire people with personalities any time in the near future. The front 9 cart girl is friendly as is the lady working the snack shack on the back. Another thing that didn't impress me was being a walk on, renting a cart and being told that they already had 2 carts in that group. I am used to being able to have my own cart instead of riding with a person I don' t know and being subjected to their cart skills or lack there of. Turned out okay but just struck me as odd. I will continue to go back for the great value but I hate to reward bad behavior.~~#~0
My wife and I stopped by last weekend to watch football and sample a couple of their brews.  The food was great could be some of the best french fries I've ever had.  The beer was good.  Noticed almost everyone drinking the house beers so it was nice to see that kind of support for an established micro brew.  There was a large crowd for football many folks wearing jerseys and everyone really getting into their game.  If your looking for an energetic place to watch football and grab a good bite this would be a place to consider.UPDATED 04/05/2012 lowered to 3 stars.I have been here a couple times since my first review and it really is just an average place.  The fries are the highlight.  The place is small, loud and well your AVERAGE pub or brewery.~~#~0
I didn't try any food hear but this place seems like it has a split personality. Tons of tvs showing sports so sports bar. At the same time there's a dj blasting club music. There weren't that many people dancing. We went here because the place next door had a huge line. One plus is that theres a second bar near the patio that we stuck by. This place to me was...meh.~~#~0
Great ice cream, but still just ice cream. Really enjoyed the salted caramel alongside a scoop of sweet corn. Feel a little silly for driving from Phoenix just for the taste but no complaints.~~#~0
Lunch here is delicious and well worth it.  Dinner?  Spend your hard-earned money elsewhere.  If it's easy-earned money and you don't care to spend then by all means enjoy the authentic atmosphere and above average French food... just don't order the flat iron steak.~~#~0
I know I might some flack for only giving this place 3 stars, but really....it's no different than Chang's.  If I could give half stars, I would give it a 3.5.  Why?  Because I think it's better than Chang's.  It's exactly the same menu (just not as diverse), but cheaper.  If you are at this location, try Tott's instead.  I bet you'll start going there more often than here.~~#~0
I've been here a grand total of three times, and I probably won't be returning any time soon.  It's not that the food is flat out bad, per se, it's just that there are many better options nearby. The first time I went on a recommendation, and the food was... OK. The 2nd time I went the food was still only... OK. The third time... well, you get the picture.The first obvious knock against Rosita's Place is the chips and salsa. They're not bad, but they're not complimentary. Given all the competition which offer free chips and salsa, you'd think these would have to be pretty darn special, but they're not. Good, but not outstanding.Secondly, the rice and beans are just OK (that descriptor keeps coming up in this review). The chicken enchiladas were fresh, but lacked any real flavor or spice. The machaca, which is supposed to be  one of their specialties, was soggy... a BIG no-no for a dish that is a specialty in this region.So, honestly, while I wouldn't discourage anyone from going here, I'm not sure what some of the hype is about, especially when Rito's, Tacos De Juarez, and Comedor Guadalajara aren't that far away.~~#~0
Similar to Los Betos - Fiesta is decent inexpensive mexican food. The staff is nice and accommodating. I did have a pretty hilarious conversation with the girl at the counter though... I was trying to order my burrito without onions, and she kept saying "okay" and "yes" and nodding at everything I said. I would ask her questions and she would say "yes" and press buttons on the register. It took me a few minutes to realize she had absolutely no idea what I was saying. Aside from that, my burrito wasn't bad... nothing special though. The beans were from a can, the guacamole wasn't fresh (I doubt anything was), everything is cooked in or made of lard, their chips are flavorless and kinda stale, and they are seriously lacking any sort of salsa. They just have the typical generic nameless hot sauce found in these joints. As I said - Los Betos... but cleaner and a little better maybe. It's just a place for convenient late-night munchies.~~#~0
Very cute, pretty good sandwich and coffee.  This is a pretty good place to stop in between shopping sprees.  They have really good/healthy sandwiches and good coffee drinks.  *Service = really fast and nice*Food = good and healthy*Atmosphere = relaxing and cute*Brownie = yummy :)~~#~0
We have one of the 1st ones to open in the valley right near us and it's OK.  Sure it has a selection of ready to eat or grocery selections, but watch the pricing.. you (somewhat understandably) pay for the convience and the "time savings" of their ready to go's.  I do like their concept and do shop there occasionally (more like if i just need something quick).Their hotdog buns are sorta sweet which is different, not different bad, just different!As for the Hybrid only parking... I don't think so...  what a joke!  :)~~#~0
I love Cheuvronts and have been going there regularly for years. Why only three stars then? Over the past year and a half the service has gone downhill. I find that the servers are impersonal and rigid, and sometimes a little pompous. After three or four bad experiences in a row I just don't go there anymore. They do have great cheese plates and a fantastic happy hour...just don't catch them when they have a special event going on.~~#~0
good coffee, friendly staff, good food.  they forgot to bring out the bagel I had ordered, but were very apologetic about it.  I will go here again.~~#~0
This Safeway holds a special place in my heart. It is only a block away from my house, the shelves are always stocked and it never seems to be busy.  There is a pharmacy (and they are quick!), meat counter, floral department, bakery and a Starbucks kiosk.  The staff is friendly, though often in no rush to get customers on their way.  There are some great deals to be had here...just don't forget your discount card.  Without it the prices are downright unreasonable, hence, the somewhat sad, three star rating.~~#~0
Getting boring in here.  It's been at least 6 months since they open but they have the same old flavors. I know you guys been busy but what happen to the "rotating flavors"???  Not sure if it's a seasonal thing or a cost factor but even the pomegranate toppings are gone (although they have pomegranate fro yo......not a fan of mine).  Competitions are moving in so change is not a bad thing.~~#~0
The Tavern on Mill is an average sports bar with cheap drinks and we come here to watch UFC fights because they don't charge a cover. We always leave when the fights end because there are better nightlife options in the area.~~#~0
Well the view is obvious.  I mean - it is decently high up and gives you a good view of downtown but, I don't know - the view from the Arizona Club is better.  We went here after watching a show at the Herberger and I was expecting some high class expensive dining that that is exactly what I got.  The service matched the price tag which was nice to see but the restaurant itself was disappointing.  Not only did they not have Coke or dark rum but they let poor Ashley A order a prime rib and then told her they were all out.  I had the drunken shrimp and they were pretty excellent.  The sauce around them was really good and they were resting on a piece of toast disguised as a crostini.  I also had a few bites of the lava cake but since it was buried under a pound of powered sugar, I couldn't eat any more.I guess I just agree with Beth S's review...I'm just not seeing what justifies the price.  The District in the Sheraton next door is a restaurant in a hotel that has amazing food that is priced better than this.  Plus, the view there isn't half bad.~~#~0
When you walk into Sky Harbor, you are bombarded with declarations that it's the country's "friendliest airport". Huh. What does this mean? User-friendly? Friendly in a "you'll always feel at home here" way? Didn't really know, but it seems extremely important to their PR group, since when you sign on for the wi-fi, you can't change pages until you rate how friendly the airport is from a drop down menu. It might be doing a disservice by proclaiming it as the superlative of congeniality. Expectations run high -- at least by me. I found the free wi-fi extremely friendly. Yeah!! Star for that. I found the den-like check in area (at least in Terminal 3), not so friendly as it left me feeling a little depressed. The TSA officer who confiscated my 4 oz (apparenly it's 3.4 oz in PHX) Neutrogena sun screen not so friendly...but not malicious, and I guess I wouldnt be so friendly if I were charged with monitoring tenths of ounces hour after hour. The spoke-security system I found to be not so friendly to both users and retail. I never like seeing a plethora of places to purchase items BEFORE security, leaving you with only a few outlets for you to browse in your little concourse. I hate wondering, what do gates 1-14 get to purchase? Is my concourse more vacant than the others? Just put security before ALL the retail and let us wander a bit. Overall, not a bad airport. at all. the friendliest? i don't know, but the free wi-fi certainly made me leave with a smile on my face!~~#~0
Mixed reviews from my husband and I:His comments: * Salad was good - we had the spinach & Gorgonzola salad. * Pizza was really good, but too expensive. Plus, it was the thinner type so you wouldn't expect to pay that much.* Wait staff - not good. * Ambiance - pretty nice. Has a NY type of feeling.* Too pricey to go backMy comments: * Salad had too much dressing. It was dripping with the balsamic stuff. I don't like soppy lettuce.* Pizza was just ok. It was served to us fairly quickly considering that the place was packed. However, it was not hot. Plus, we had to wave our server down to ask her to heat it up. She didn't seem very happy with us and did not offer an apology for the cold pie. After all, this place is called Humble Pie. * Wait staff - Not good. Not very forthcoming with the menu and only seemed to be interested in getting the ordering over with.* The staff should be humble enough to ask the customer if everything is ok after the food is served. That never happened. Even when she brought over the check we got nothing. * Ambiance - too loud and dark! Tables and chairs are packed tight in this place so plan to share your space with others not in your party. * Definitely not going back. We paid $34 plus tip for a small Cesar salad, pizza with three toppings, soft drink and glass of wine. Too much money for some Si's food.~~#~0
So I was meeting some friends here last night for drinks for a friend's birthday. We were supposed to meet at 9:30 but it was around 10:30 when we actually got to the bar. We walked in and had our IDs checked and then stood around awkwardly...I'm not sure why this happened, but after a few minutes we were asked if we needed a table. Yup...that's why we're here. So we were seated near the bar. The place is large and the decor is fine, but the music they were playing was mainly from the 90's and made the place seem less 'hip' I guess, not that I know much about being hip. We waited for about 5 minutes for anyone to acknowledge us. The waiter finally came by and took our drink order. I got the agave basil margarita ($8.50) which was soooo good! I was very happy with the drink. The Birthday Girl got a blueberry bliss... which wasn't what she was expecting. I tried it and thought it was good, but it was definitely more like wine than a mixed drink. The others got beers. So the real problem, for me at least, was my second drink. I got a tropical margarita ($7.00). It was one of the worst drinks I have ever had and was a challenge to drink. It was SO acidic and just nasty, I swear the two drinks could not have come from the same place...but they did. That's a huge red flag for me.Side note: Why do restaurants think it's cool to not price their signature drinks....why should I have to ask how much it costs? I find this completely ridiculous and annoying. The drinks didn't end up being very expensive here, but I feel like I should have that information available to me on the menu just like any other item.... *ok steps off soapbox*As far as food goes, one of my friends got a side of fries that were pretty good and came with bbq sauce, but other than that we did not eat. I have heard good things about their food from other people. After we were done with our second round of drinks (and the fries) we decided to move on to another bar.....but we couldn't because we had no check! Our waiter, who had been almost harassing us towards the beginning of our night, had completely disappeared. He finally came by like 10-15 minutes later and reeked of cigarettes....there is no way he only smoked one because I could almost taste it...pretty gross for a waiter. Anyway, our checks were brought fairly quickly after that and we were finally able to leave.  Conclusion: Be very careful what you order....it is a total mixed bag.~~#~0
Ok, I usually write longer more intricate reviews about a restaurant but for this new establishment I will summerize.1.  Great decor and ambience; would be better minus the flat screens2.  Friendly service; but needs more training with food and knowledge of 3.  Timing of Kitchen; if a table has two or more persons, food should come out at the same time or around the same time.  Especially when they are not sharing.4.  Food; if you specialize in spring rolls, please make sure they are rolled up proficiently.  It needs to be tight, not loose:) Flavors are good, but there could be a variation of sauce for the spring rolls.  4 rotating flavors for over 20 rolls is not a good ratio.5.  Pricing is not bad for some items, but I do agree with other reviews that for most items, the pricing is a little high for the neighborhood biz and the quality of food offered.Overall, nice place to hang with friends for a drink and nibble before the actual dinner somewhere else.I will give it a few more months for an update.  This place has potential, but not well executed. When opening a restaurant, you should be ready and able to.  If you are not, you should wait til the staff is well trained.   I believe the owner or chef is inexperience.  Hopefully, it will improve...Get to work guys!!~~#~0
The new leaner breakfast sandwiches are good (they basically take the bottom and top of the bagel and you are left with smaller ends of your sandwich). An easy way to cut calories without losing the taste.~~#~0
I am not in love with this place nor do I despise it.I am Mr. Middle-of-the Road with Stacy's.Somethings he does very well, others are just so-so.Here are the Do's and Don'ts-DO-Order a sweet potato pie to go. That happens to rock the house!Have the pulled pork sandwich. Solid sandwich.DONT--Do not and I mean DO NOT order the chicken BBQ sandwich. I ordered this a couple months ago and I could have used the shredded chicken as toothpicks. They were hard and came served in a weird cone-like shape on the bun. Also, skip the sweet potato fries. They are dry and taste like dirt. Yep, I said it. Sorry Stacy. Back to the drawing board on those.The sauce is everything at a BBQ joint and his is just OK. Actually, I have had better in a store-bought bottle from AJs.If you are in the area, go for it. If you live out in Glendale, it's probably not worth the drive. I am not sure what Bon Appetite was thinking when they gave this one of the top 10 new BBQ joints of 2009.The lady who works behind the counter is funny as hell and is a total sweetheart! BTW--CASH MONEY only!~~#~0
It's a taqueria in a Latino supermarket.  Nothing special but you have choices. They will have just about everything you may like. It's not gourmet and some things are just sitting in the pans but at least you can look at what you want.I'd go back if I just needed something quick....~~#~0
I truly wanted to love this place! I had the shrimp/pork spring rolls and shrimp/chicken vermicelli salad - both were quite good, with the exception of the rice paper and noodles tasting like they were rehydrated with unfiltered tap water (both had a weird taste). My husband's food, on the other hand, was terrible! He ordered #44 - the rice was extremely dry and chewy, the pork chop tasted ok, but was mostly bone and gristle, and the shredded pork was downright disgusting.~~#~0
Great bar with a friendly bartender named "Bob"~~#~0
I usually shop at this store because it is the most convenient and has the best prices and selection in the area. For staple goods such as bread, milk, eggs, meats, and canned goods, the prices are usually lower than the other large grocery stores. Their branded goods (Kroger) such as condiments are usually good quality compared to store brands at other stores. However, in the last few years, vegetable prices have skyrocketed (other than tomatoes, celery, and lettuce) so I find myself driving several miles away to a healthy food specialty store to stock up. This Fry's was recently renovated, seemingly to make it more difficult to find the items you are looking for, and making what should be a quick trip in an out into a half-hour ordeal. The aisles also seem to be harder to navigate, with bulky displays jutting out here and there, and it's difficult to get around other customers. What I do like is that there are four self-checkouts so you usually don't have to wait in lines. I also like Fry's policy of charging you the price on the shelf-tag, or you get the item free. I've often walked out with cash in my pockets when I went in with none. Sometimes due to the confusing "VIP customer" pricing on the receipt, it's a bit difficult to tell if you paid the right price. Read your receipt carefully!~~#~0
Sometimes you CAN judge a book by its cover. This looks like a typical diner and indeed that's what it was. Even though the place was busy (Sunday breakfast time) I was immediately seated, the servers were friendly and everyone used the obligatory "hon" when addressing you, and the food came fast in spite of the busy time. Taste and quality of the food were typical for a diner - OK, not great, but the pancakes were definitely more than I could finish. Not as inexpensive as I though it would be: pancakes (3) with bacon and eggs and a cup of coffee came to a few cents short of 10 bucks! Very casual atmosphere: most of the folks here were attired like they were about to do some home gardening after breakfast.~~#~0
Again, it's a bit unfair of me to rate this restaurant because I'm from San Jose/Cupertino but I'm gonna do it anyway.So, being from San Jose/Cupertino, I've had me some good Chinese food and even better dim sum. So when the Boyfriend brought me here, I was expecting something decent, but not anything too authentic.This place was fairly decent and authentic! It has the Asian ladies and their dim sum carts. It has the OG dim sum dishes. It even has the authentic less than mediocre Asian service. The only disappointment is that this place is a bit dirty and ragged-y looking. And the vegetable dishes are minimal. In fact, I had to order a veg dish off the menu because they didn't have any dim sum veg dishes and it cost $13! Bleh.~~#~0
Sherwin is old and not very reliable but he is a really nice guy. I will give him that much. Very good optician as well~~#~0
Was craving something different tried this place recommended by a friend. Was impressed with the lasagna. 30 min wait well worth it. Service was ok food pretty good~~#~0
Spinato's has great red sauce for the pasta but I prefer a more earthy pizza. High School kids love it though. This restaurant was a Chili's before, but they have remodeled and did a fabulous job. The take out door is discrete and the bar area is large and comfortable. Food portions are quite big and they have a nice selection on the menu.~~#~0
Had breakfast this morning while waiting on getting my windows on my car tinted. I had the build your own omelete. I got it with chorizo bell peppers and cheddar cheese. It was pretty good and the portion size was big for the price. They had fresh squeezed orange juice too. Not the best breakfast I've had but it was good.~~#~0
Jason B. and I decided to try this place on Saturday night. I looked at the menu online and though the food sounded really interesting.We started with the Artichoke Croquettes, and the Calamari as well. We were disappointed in the Artichoke Croquettes, you get 4 half Artichokes fried with alternating Marinara and this white sauce. The only thing that was good about this dish was the white sauce, which we used to dip the Calamari in. The Calamari was your average calamari, nothing special! I ordered a the 19th Street Burger, which was cooked perfectly and came with a spicy sauce, not sure if the sauce was for the Onion Rings, but it was great of the Burger.Not sure I will be rushing back to the Armadillo Grill, but I wouldn't say no to going back again!~~#~0
My gang usually stumble in her at some point during our nights out and about in Old Town.  They have a decent selection of beers on tap and there are usually a couple tables open if you want to sit down. It's a bar, not a club, so don't expect much.  They have servers that are polite and prompt and the wait at the bar isn't usually very long.  Worth a stop to support a local biz.~~#~0
Really solid lunch deals and pretty close to Tex-Mex which I still get cravings for from time to time. I had the spinach chicken enchiladas and they were nice. It was a ton of food (of course) so we definitely needed boxes for leftovers. If you're in the neighborhood, it's a solid deal and I'd stop in again. My only wish is that they did a green sauce with the spinach chicken enchiladas. That would be heaven.~~#~0
Alison B. sums up all the great things about this unique store - and I would return if I was looking for a unique gift for any female friends of mine.However, when I went in on a Sunday I was 1 of 4 women in the store.  The man working was chatting it up with the 3 other women who turned out to be together, and once they left he had a seat and didn't say a word to me as I browsed.  I walked out after several minutes of silence.~~#~0
You're in 120 degree Scottsdale weather and you need a casual change of clothes, a bite to eat, and a refreshing adult beverage; Tommy Bahama can do it all under one roof. A retail clothier on the bottom floor and a decent, predictable place to eat and drink upstairs...ok, I'll work with you Tommy. There is nothing special about this place except I found their service in both their retail space and restaurant superb. Try their grilled crab cakes and their twice shaken martini.~~#~0
I've only ever been here for Transylvania which is their Friday night Gothic Industrial night.  It's acceptable.  I have high standards.  Sometimes the music is really good.  Sometimes it sucks.  They have 2 DJs and I can always tell when the switch from the one whose tastes I enjoy to the one whose tastes I don't.  If you're looking for Death Bunnis, Razor Grrls, Baby Bats or *sigh* Suicide Girls, you'll find a few of them here.  There are a lot of regulars and I usually have a good time, unless of course I don't.  The people there have all been fairly nice.The drinks are nothing special.  They aren't terrible, they just aren't terribly consistent.  If you need to get wasted, get some shots poured. At least that way you know what you're getting.So when you need to strap on your boots, wear your eyeliner, and shake your ass, give it a shot.~~#~0
I am writing this update soley based on the feeling one gets when going to Spitfire Grill, the food and drinks are always good.Our complaint about Spitfire is that the owner and staff is never very welcoming. My fiancee and I have been there 15+ times and there is never any recognition by the staff. The owner is always there and he has never introduced himself or thanked us for coming in again.  The servers have never said 'welcome back or good to see you again'. For a neighborhood restaurant I would think you would want to make your regular customers feel appreciated. We love the food and the restaurant is right around the corner from our house, but we lean toward other, farther away restaurants with a more weloming feel.For example, last night we went to House of Tricks in Tempe. It was our 4th visit. When we walked in three of the employees greeted us and welcomed us back. The bartenders remembered what we drink and asked us about something we discussed last time we were there.Talk about feeling welcome! Spitfire has a lot to learn if they want to survive in a neighborhood lacation.~~#~0
It was my first visit to Wienerschnitzel and OMG two words CORN DOG! It is better than the ones at the State Fair. I also had the polish dog. I am sorry but Costco's is better. The french fries were OK. The best thing I had was the corn dog.~~#~0
Expect to pay $10-12 for a decent burger and fries in a tacky, blue-themed interior in cafeteria-style tables and seats.The happy hours isn't bad, as it boasts some reasonable and fun appetizers along with $2.50 IPA drafts, among other options.The service was decent, but not great, and the ambiance as a whole didn't seem to be worth the prices on the dinner menu.  At least, I can think of several better options.~~#~0
Narcisse is truly an interesting place. Good food and pretty good service. The staff/servers look good and keep the "image is everything" so important here in Scottsdale working for this place even if the looks exceed the quality of the service. The late night crowd is of the "look at me" variety and makes it a good people watching establishment if you do not mind the huge egos that go with it. The selections of food and drink are impressive. If you can reserve a table to dine and drink with friends do it as the place fills up and leads to a fun night out experience for the above 30 crowd.~~#~0
Alright, so how does it go from being a 1-star (actually, less than that) to being a 3-star review? Simple, they seem better than the last time I was working/shopping here. I went here the other night to help my boyfriend find an interview outfit and noticed that the store had a handful of the same employees as they did back in the Summer, but certain areas of clothing had been moved around. Despite all the moving and switching around they must have done, the store seemed really clean and in order. In fact, I really have no issues with this store except one, teeny tiny, little problem...the check out girl!I remember her from when I worked here and she gave me attitude when I needed to ask her something. Turns out, it wasn't a one time thing.. she's just a rude person. On this particular night, there were only two check out girls and a line of about 15 people. My boyfriend and I were making seperate purchases and knew one of us was going to get her. I happened to get the friendly one, but before we each paid for our items, we were watching as the rude girl didn't crack even ONE half-hearted attempt at a smile. We listened as she rudely explained to some elderly ladies why a certain item was marked on sale but the same item was normal priced. They wanted to make sure they weren't paying too much/too little and her explanation?: "That ones been the store longer." It didn't make sense to them, or to those of us in line watching, but she kept getting huffy about it until they dropped the issue. She shoved people's items in bags and practically threw them at them and said, again without trying to fake some kind of customer service, "Have a good night. Bye. NEXT!" Yuck.My cashier was slightly more frienldy, but still not awesome. It was obvious she was having a long night (afterall, she was stuck at the register with the Ice Queen), so it was understandable. Also, I didn't catch her name, but the girl working in the dressing rooms was really sweet and kept greeting everyone that came by. I had to call this location to get the name of the manager for something I was filling out on a form and I was told they've got a new manager. Thus, I know why this jumped up two stars. It could have been four, but certain things they haven't fixed (rude cashier girl) have kept this review at a solid three.~~#~0
For such a small space, Stinkweeds definitely does a good job of packing as much variety as they can in their store. As far as record stores go, they've got a pretty decent collection in both CD's and vinyl. My only qualm with this place is that they tend to only carry newer stuff or the more popular titles of indie genres. If you're like me and like to peruse through older and hard-to-find collections, be sure to check out Tracks in Wax a few blocks down the street on Central. That being said, this is definitely a place you'll want to drop into. Their selection of concert/music video DVD's is pretty solid as is what their magazine stand has to offer. Sure, it's no Amoeba but it's the next best thing.~~#~0
I wanted to add a review to the actual company's website, but I could not figure it out. I'm curious where all the testimonials came from. I have mixed feelings on my experience. In the end, I think I ended up with some beautiful windows, though. My salesperson was very engaging. I felt pretty confident in my decision to go with American Vision Windows after that first experience. There was some miscommunication on scheduling the measurement, but it worked itself out fairly quickly. I started to lose confidence when I was told a specific date that my windows would be in, but never heard anything from the company four days after that date. When I called them to find out where my windows were, I was told they had just received them and they could schedule my install in 2 weeks. Since I only had Saturday install available, that was understandable. The Friday before my install, they called to reschedule to the following weekend because the rainstorm (that just occurred that day) had put them behind two days. Again, I guess that was fairly understandable, but I felt like the peon that was the easiest to push off. Luckily the installers did show up the following Saturday on the earlier side of the provided time frame. I kind of don't know what to say about the install. There were two guys, one seemed to know what he was doing, the other I had less confidence in. The job took 4 hours to install 6 windows. During the entire transaction I was never told how long the install would take, so I'm not sure if that was normal or not. The two guys actually seemed to be fighting during the entire install. I believe the head guy was joking around with the other by basically telling him he sucked. I think the other guy was genuinely getting angrier and angrier. In all honesty, I was very uncomfortable being in my own house while the install was going on. I was a bit disappointed in the cleanup of the job. I ended up having to cleanup inside the window tracks and windowsills on the inside and brush off the sills on the outside. I don't feel I should have had to do that. Before they left, I was handed a survey to review the entire process (salesperson, overall experience, install). I think that is a horrible practice that needs to be changed. I didn't want to sit there writing out a review on all of the above while the installer is waiting for me, and then hand it right back to him. What it did cause me to do is overstate my review because I'm not going to give the installers 2 stars and hand the paper back to the person I just reviewed. I can't say I would recommend this company, but I feel the way customer service has been going, it's really a tossup on what you will get from any company.P.S. I forgot to mention my plants. I have recently spent a lot of my own time and money on landscaping my backyard so this stuck out to me big time. I understand when installing windows it's difficult to pay attention to the foliage below your feet, but I think some attempt to not trample all over the plants would be very much appreciated. For example, when washing the windows, I think an effort can be made not to stand directly on top of a plant and twist your foot back and forth. I'm still hoping I do not loose a couple of plants due to the trauma they endured.~~#~0
So I recently went here with a friend of mine because they were craving IHOP, and I didn't care were we went to eat as long is it had food.I got one of there new healthy choice menu items the balsamic chicken and my friend got the club sandwich with a side salad and a side of pancakes...don't ask.The food was surprisingly really good and the service was excellent.~~#~0
Overall this place isn't so bad for a quick mexican food place. It's not like eating at a restaurant or anything like that. The food portions are pretty great and sold at a fair price. I really liked their salsa and I felt it was nice and flavorful. I'd say this place is a small step up from Filbertos.The staff here, however, were really rude. They seemed to want to rush everyone around.~~#~0
Fair pricing and no upselling. These guys are good--but be warned, it's as busy as an angry beehive on Monday mornings!~~#~0
This place was kinda cool. We first got there around 9:30 on a saturday night. The place was dead... but that is to be expected for a "night club". The drinks are expensive, but tasty. The decor is AMAZING. The couches are comfy and there is just enough seating space without it overtaking the joint. We ended up leaving after 1 drink and went back a few hours later and the place was busy busy busy. They had great music playing and the dance floor was full. One downfall was, I hate when you go to a bar and the bathroom has an attendant that you need to tip. They are holding everything that you need... soap and paper towels. I feel that I shouldnt feel forced to tip someone because I wanted to wash my hands after I used the bathroom. Overall the place was decent. I am new in town and I am sure that there are better places to have a drink. I will most likely go back (in the future), just not in a rush to.~~#~0
They don't have the lunch specials on the menu or tell you about them if you don't ask, so make sure to ask. The sandwiches don't come with fries and their fries are over priced for not being very good. The pulled pork sandwich is good and so is the sauce. Also, expect a long wait especially if people are ahead of you.~~#~0
Same Majerle's menu as the other locations.  Decent food (especially wings), but high prices for both food and drink.  Good service -- even overattentive on my last visit.  Great setup for watching football games.~~#~0
In here for a sec but everyone seemed to be having a good time!  Live D.j. and enough room to be who u wanta be on the dance floor... there was poker going on in the corner and with a nice sized crowd. I liked the bartender chick, and she was fast for being the only bartender in there, and very nice.~~#~0
Friday night after a long workweek seemed to be a good time to treat ourselves to a new cuisine, so my friend and fellow yelper John M. and I decided to check out this Uzbek restaurant. The interior would be mostly generic in appearance were it not for the somewhat ornate Middle-Eastern curtains, and a TV screen playing Uzbek and Russian music videos added to the ambiance. Large pictures of the main dishes in the counter area show you what they offer even before you are seated and handed a menu. For starters, we ordered Uzbek salad - tomatoes, cucumbers and sweet white onions lightly drizzled with a dill vinaigrette - and blinchik, which are crepes with a flavorful meat and onion stuffing; beware, the blinchik are rather filling by themselves. We also ordered palov and lamb kebabs. The palov was a dish of tasty seasoned rice with carrots and meat, and was quite a good choice. The lamb kebabs were juicy and flavorful, though the rice that came with it was on the dry side. A small basket of warm pita bread rounded up the meal. In all, it was a good meal, not great, but definitely satisfying. And I do hope to try the soup dishes next time.~~#~0
After reading multiple Yelp reviews on this business, I decided to come here for the greatest hits: Pizza muffins, Calzones and Antipasto salad.I thought the pizza muffins were interesting and a great alternative to bread sticks or garlic bread. They were loaded with TONS of sausage and ham and came with 2 different dipping sauces. Although a little greasy and re-heated, I appreciated the novelty factor.On to the entrees, the small Antipasto salad (5.99) was absolutely filling for a one person meal. I didn't find it any different from any Antipasto salad I have tried before, but I think people love it for the dressing - which had flavor but A LOT of oil (more than half of the total dressing). The ingredients were fresh but there is nothing out of this world about iceberg lettuce and dry mozzarella. The calzone was larger than a newborn baby and hotter than Phoenix in the summertime. Although the corners are mostly (if not all) bread the taste was very good and overloaded with tasty insides. The spinach ham combo my friend ordered was pretty satisfying and this meal could easily be split in 2 for tasty leftovers... if you can stop eating.I found the teenage staff to be friendly and cheery but the bathroom needs massive help. Only one stall and really unpleasant smells, the female employee who had just left the bathroom as I entered left wet paper towels on the handles of both exit doors... covering the entire area for me to hold on to and pull. Just.... disgusting, especially from an employee who should be trying to keep the establishment clean and good looking.All in all, good but not great. Its pretty affordable so if this is your price range, I think you can make it work and still have a tasty meal.~~#~0
Food is a little pricer than standard Chili's, but it's in an airport so that's expected. Service was good, food came out quickly and to order. Be sure to stop by before you head through security.~~#~0
Arrived around 5pm one Wednesday evening. The place is not in a nice area of Phoenix, and it looked deserted, and I was going to leave, when I saw a Mercedes and Lexus pull up.  So I thought I'd give it a chance. The prices were somewhat reasonable, I got the Lo-Lo's for $11 (2 waffles, and 3 pieces of fried chicken). The food was tasty for what it was, but I only give it 3 *'s because its just so unhealthy.. kool-aid, waffles, syrup, and fried chicken! This is the kinda a place I may go once a year, but I just feel so guilty!  Not sure what the syrup was, but it certainly wasn't real maple syrup (I'd imagine it is some sugar based creation), and the waffles were dry. The chicken wasn't very moist, it was also a bit on the dry side.~~#~0
Ive been to F&H on numerous occasions. The night usually goes a little like this..  I walk up to the entrance, I see people smoking outside in a small fence area. I look over and see these groups are starring at me like i just blatantly readjusted myself in public.  I give them one more glance and realize in two hours we all will all be best friends exchanging pointless stories about our days when in reality I couldn't give a flying f*[% about their new kitten they adopted and named Bunbun. But in 2 hours I will thrive and cherish each of their stories and be amazed I never found such intellectual people sooner. Before I get to the door I feel eyes spying on me. I look up to find  one of 17 hostesses peering through the window ready to yank the door open a mere second before I reach for it. (you can't beat them to this..  Ive tried several times, they are good at what they do. Just prepare for this and accept it.) as I step inside my eyes automatically affix to the bar top. I scan up and down the row of seats. As I'm scanning down I see two empty seats. I'm not sure if guy code applies to bar seats like the bathroom urinals (guys.. You know what I'm talking about)..  But I usually just start the night off not giving a...  Because I already aknowledge the fact things are only going to degrade from here anyways. I start with a tall miller light and look up at the game playing on the TV's. I continue my beer almost empty then order some beer battered buffalo chicken tenders with extra ranch. I look into the reflection of my phone to make sure my face isn't suddenly disfigured because she looks at me as if I just asked for an order of wine and chive biscottes. I explain that I am looking to get the beer battered buffalo wings then she calls for backup like I'm speaking a foreign language.  "Hey Lacey! This guy wants beer battered buffalo chicken wings" they say some things, fumble a bit then come back with..  So you want "chicken tenders and ranch?".  I explain again to the both of them. They both tilt their heads to the side. Either this one beer slammed me, and I'm speaking nonsense at this point, or they just don't understand what buffalo wings are.   "so..you want a cheeseburger and a side of buffalo sauce sir?". They do a little further team planning and come up with a solution and I end up with beer battered chicken tenders dry as a bone with no sauce and a side of buffalo sauce. My friend getting the opposite  when we both ordered the same thing except he gets no buffalo sauce and a side of ranch.. I find it to bother me less and less each time because I expect it now.  Their food really is good, and their service is...Did i mention that their food is really good? I look back up at the TV acting real smooth and care free only to realize ive been watching female tennis on the television next to me for the past 30 minutes while everyone eIse is attentively watching the football game. I'm not ashamed to admit that I continued watching it. I think it was the loud grunts that kept my attention. I finish eating, grab another beer and me and the friend approach the ping pong table. You need to go to the hosts stand to get the equipment. It's free. Wait no it's not..  It's a dollar. Nope that was last month. Now it's 9 bucks an hour. Better empty those pockets. Just remember every hour you waste playing you could have fed 27 starving ethiopians for  a month. But in your drunken stooper you chose to dish out the $9 like myself and play pool or ping pong. Shame on you.PS.., beware of the twins...  I thought I was loosing my mind after a few beers seeing one girl cover the whole restaurant in a matter of mere seconds. If you ask  your server for something and she looks at you funny...  it's either because you asked her twin, or you asked for buffalo chicken tenders.Also... if you stay late enough the cops hide and wait for you to leave the parking lot as soon as you turn out. But of course you have a designated driver... right?Overall, the food I have ordered was great.The service was...the food was really good.~~#~0
I haven't been to a Sweet Tomatoes location in well over 3 years. I have never been to this location before, but the service was good. The selections haven't changed that much. I was pleased to see they had strawberry muffins with strawberry butter. YUMMY! The salads are still fresh and good.I wish they had more non dairy alternatives there.~~#~0
Being that not many places were open on New Years Day, I decided to cruise around and see what was open.  Being that the bookstore wasnt quite open yet and had a horrendous line, I drove around a little bit to see if I could grab a cup of coffee to kill some time.I pulled into the parking lot because theres several stores located in this strip mall, and have shopped at a few stores here before.  I found this coffee shop smashed inbetween other stores.  Its a very small shop, with extremely limited seating.  I will say I liked it here, and I enjoyed my experience for a lot of reasons.  Thier prices are cheap as all get out, which is great!  I got a 12 ounce Mocha for $3.24.  Awesome!  Service here was amazing and friendly, and I will gladly return in the future.So why 3 stars?  there were a whopping 2 tables to sit at inside, and thats kind of a problem.  I also asked the girl about the internet, and she said the signal was in and out, and should be fixed in a few days after the holiday.  For me, a coffee shop is a place that I like to park at for an hour, plug in my computer, surf the net, and drink coffee.  I dont like sitting outside because A) I have no plug and my battery dies after an hour, and B) in the summer Im not sitting in the heat.  So, even though I would return for the prices and service, I wouldnt recomend this place for anyone who plans on staying for more then 5 minutes.~~#~0
Sandwiches are pretty decent and tasty..however..they don't include drinks, salad, just a small cookie on the side. We just ordered 2 sanwiches and 2 sodas, a little on the overpriced side, totaled out to $27 just for that. The sandwiches are gigantic or anything. just left feeling a bit hungry and disappointed.~~#~0
Fancy  shop with great kitchen items that I would use for our kitchen. It seems whenever I go in there their products don't work. Avoid ordering any of their coffee pots because we had to return them twice in a row. It seems like whenever we walk in there the employees don't seem to be knowledgeable about the products there. I give this store three stars for having a variety of kitchen items and an enchanting place to visit.~~#~0
It is a salad bar.~~#~0
Check-in was fast and quick and price was right for what it was. A big upgrade over a discount property and super close to the airport. It does resemble a different kind of hotel in that everything was outside, but the room was spacious and generally quiet. The morning breakfast was solid and the only real minus was the shuttle's delay; some of the hotels came twice in the time it took this one to show up once. But save for that...a more than adaquate experience for an overnight stay.~~#~0
A coyote ugly knock off but a cool place. The ladies were friendly and there was one who could dance her ass off. Dayum!! Seriously though, I was the token black chic  and had a good time. Except for the one lady that seem to attach herself to me. Weird to say the least. Overall a cool place.Be warned, do not attempt to take any pictures in this place. They will hunt you down and stop you. Especially if the ladies are "performing" on the bar. A big no-no!!!~~#~0
I prefer this location to others in the valley.  Except for afternoon rush hour.  Dont go there between 3 and 6.  Unless youre a senior citizen, then its ok.  Youll fit right in.I went for dinner and cant complain.  its your basic buffet, it seems like it has a larger selection than Ryans or JBs and the food quality is way better than both of those.  The brisket and beef tips were great, the only problem i had with the place was the wal mart environment (crying kids, way crowded, people acting like THAT steak was the last one ever made, etc) and i did make the mistake of going during grandma social hour, but aside from that, ill go back when Im craving 10 different things at once, which happens often :)Dinner buffet for 2 runs a little under 30 bucks with drinks.~~#~0
Taco Bell/Pizza Hut combo on Dobson and Southern. Typical taco bell food and service. Lunch is very busy at this location because it is within walking distance of MCC, Pima Medical Institute, Banner Desert Hospital and a gazillion apartment complexes. Parking is easy, but this shopping center is very difficult to get in or out of during rush hour.~~#~0
I can understand why everyone loves this place-- who wouldn't, right? With so many choices of cool, creamy gelato? Well, unless I am just very unlucky and visited on a bad day, this Gelato Spot has gone steeply downhill. My husband ordered a strawberry-kiwi flavored and I chocolate peanut butter. We both agreed: the gelato tasted grainy, with noticable ice crystals. And worse, the flavorings tasted like they came from a bottle, not fresh. IMO, this has become more of a place to see-and-be-seen -- not savor good gelato!~~#~0
In a hurry in the Phoenix airport and saw Blue Burrito Grille. Ordered the Big Blue Burrito with pork. Unlike a previous reviewer, I got a LARGE burrito with plenty of fillings including some very tasty pork. The salsa was also very good. Their website says that the burritos come with chips and there was a huge bin of them on the counter but alas my burrito came sans chips... which I didn't notice until after I was on the airplane. A good place for a quick Mexican lunch but make sure you get the chips.~~#~0
I thought I had reviewed this location already?  Weird.  The one closer to the mall is a total hassle since it is crowded with no parking so it is much better to go here instead (even if you are actually shopping at the mall).  You all know about the food and you either love it or you hate it but I just like this location since there is usually not much of a line, at least in the evenings.~~#~0
I have never been here before so I didn't know what to expect.  Every time I heard the name "Duck & Decanter"  I would picture a nice sit-down joint with waiters and pictures of hunting stuff on hunter green walls.  This is certainly not the case I realized upon entering.  It is just a sandwich place that also sells a bunch of random bric-a-brac.  It is all basically picnic stuff I think.  I dunno...it was real difficult to get a feel for the place.  It was all pretty random to me.  But anyway, about the food....I ordered "The Duckling" sandwich was is one of their "signature sandwiches".  It seemed like a good selection because the name of the sandwich and the sandwich itself had duck in it and so does the name of the restaurant.  However, the sandwich was just ok.  Nothing special.  Not worth 9 bucks.  just a few slices of meat in between 2 pieces of bread.All the sandwiches on the menu did however look interesting.  They are definitely not your typical "sandwich place" type sandwiches.  Well some of them are but they all have that special Duck & Decanter twist.  The have some deli type sandwich selections as well but I would prefer to just go to a deli for those.My wife ordered the chicken salad and it was very very good.  I would order it if I ever visit the place again.  She ordered the Sonoran with spicy oil & vinegar.  It was very tasty and no mayo or any of the bad stuff.The service was very friendly but I took a long while to get our sandwiches.  There must have been a large order ahead of us or something because there weren't many people in the place.  I couldn't imagine going here on a weekday during the  lunch rush because the line would likely be out the door and would take forever to get your food.  Luckily for me I went on a hot Sunday afternoon.~~#~0
I was looking for chile rellenos and this place does a great job of making them just the way I like it.  Flavorful and not dry.   Also had the chips and salsa which I did not think were anything special and you have to order them unlike most Mexican places where it is expected at the time they serve the drinks.  Flan was unimpressive.  I think I will go back for the chile rellenos and head down the street to Carlsbad Tavern for the flan (theirs is my favorite).~~#~0
3.5 stars. We decided to check this place out after all the waves. The space and decor is nice and cute, and girly! We arrived at 10:30 for a Sunday brunch, and there were plentiful of empty seats for us to choose. Nice patio, too!I had the French Toast with fresh strawberries and chicken apple sausage (however, the menu says with raspberry, I didn't really care for either one, meh~) The toasts were thick and soft, but weren't that outstanding. I really liked the chicken apple sausages on the other hand, they were tasty and not the typical greasy kind. Friend had the Spinach and Tomato Omelette with feta cheese. I didn't take a bite, but she really enjoyed it. It came with a side of potatoes and fresh fruits.  Our waitress was nice, but the service was slow... Overall we had a nice little trip. It's definitely a good spot for a girls' day out!~~#~0
First visit...Had lunch here today - used my Groupon.  We ordered the Bruschetta, Pretzels and Steak & Cheese Calzone.-We both thought there was WAY too much Balsamic used.  Also, we expected mozzarella cheese - not Feta.-We tried the butter and salt pretzel & cinnamon sugar with honey pretzel.  They were okay. They should have kept the honey on the side like they did for the mustard.-The calzone was good. We liked the dough and it was fairly well filled/stuffed.Overall, we thought it was average as far as the food is concerned - and a little pricey for quality and portions.We have another Groupon to use so maybe we'll try a pizza for the next one.~~#~0
I liked, it was spicy, the beans and hot sauce they bring to u for dipping is so so so good, also order their mini chimichangas for appetizer, their margaritas for 2 is good shear with ur company ;-) from their menu i liked the chicken, steak fajitas also the white sand chimichanga its a bomb...~~#~0
OK, decent beer selection, but no local beer on tap?  Whats with that?Place has a nice ambience but can be rather claustrophobic, service is good somtimes, and absolutley terrible on other occasions. Some of the pasties are not as good as they sound and can be quite dry.  Be careful when ordering.  The original classic pasty is always a good bet. Good yet short happy hour & a creative atlternative to the average corner pub. Could be better, could be 5 stars!~~#~0
Holy. Shit. I can't believe I am giving this place a 3 1/2 star review. My first time coming here was for the Yelp event as well, and I do love the central location of the bar. And while I am willing to let a lot of dive bars slide and be gross and can be picky about the nicest lounges, I am about to get my (recovering art) bitch on:1) The ambiance is zero. I really felt like I was walking into someone's house...and not in a good way. Like the lame neighborhood kid who is pretty loaded promised me his mom made some fucking awesome sandwiches and I went with him inside his house to check out his stocked kitchen.2) The art work? I hate to say it, but amateurish. I would rather have art work from IKEA remainders decorate the walls.3) I HATE HIGH TABLES AND STOOLS. I HATE THEM. I really, really fucking hate them. Sure, there are 'normal' seats and tables in the back...in the dark where bad kids go and you feel restricted and clausterphobic. And no comfy seats to be seen. Hanging out at the "bar" is weird cause you are really inviting yourself to talk to whomever is next to you (which can be cool...or suck ass). So I just can't get fucking comfortable.4) The side patio is soooo lovely. For smokers. Who have to leave their beers inside. As one friend stated: Why can't the smokers smoke out front and let the drinkers get to enjoy the beautiful side patio in peace?5) Snacks. None. No food. So much for the rich kids mom well stocked cabinets.6) Beer and service (basically the guy at the bar/kitchen opening your bottle for you) is fine. I love the diverse beer selection, and after telling the guy what I liked in beer, he picked the Kronenberg which is what I drink on tap at Cornish Pasty (which I get to drink with delicious food), so he was totally spot on. A beer menu would go a long way here, describing each beer, import, alchohol percentage, PRICE, etc. (Was there one there and I didn't see it?)7) Bathrooms are wicked nice.So, the space is really malleable, perfect for one on one, but especially group settings. Hey, I like this place enough. Will I go here when in Phoenix? Yeah. Probably a LOT. Near the Art Walk, Roosevelt, Modified, etc and guarenteed an un-shady time. I had fun both times I was here. But it reminded me an awful lot of the MIT bar I would hang out in that was essentially a teachers lounge with a fireplace and three shitty cheap beers on tap, only with so-so art. This place teaches you its all about location.~~#~0
I got dragged back here by persistent coworkers, and the knowledge that they have "Thirsty Thursdays". For Thirsty Thursday you can get a huge stein full of absolutely any drink you want for only 5 bucks. Hellooooooo vodka! The puke smell is pretty much gone (They removed the carpet). I still don't like the food... but if you get drunk enough, I suppose it doesn't matter.~~#~0
I don't live on this side of town, but I met up with some visiting relatives, on their way out of town, for a bon voyage lunch.When we walked in, there was one other couple in the restaurant - not such a great sign seeing as how we arrived at the peak of lunchtime.  Anyway, we sat at a table and looked over a handful of lunch specials.  Three of us ordered from the lunch menu (Pad Thai, Sweet & Sour Chicken, and Garlic Chicken) and one ordered from the menu (fried salmon).Unlike some other Thai (or even Chinese restaurants), the lunch specials did not come with soup and the "egg roll" was actually a small spring roll.  The Pad Thai wasn't cooked in red oil as is common in Western renditions of the dish.  It actually just looked like lo mein with different noodles.  I didn't taste it, so I can't comment on that, but I was told that "it was pretty good, but didn't contain much meat."My order of Sweet & Sour Chicken was somewhat deceiving.  On the menu, it said that it was going to be served with tomatoes, so I expected, like, chunks of tomato, but in actuality, the sauce is tomato paste based.  The chicken was shaved, so it was super thin, and had a weird texture.  The order of Garlic Chicken is exactly the same dish as the Sweet & Sour Chicken, with two exceptions: the sauce (duh!) and the main garnish is ginger.  The dish smells incredible, but if you're not a big fan of ginger, I'd avoid it.  Seriously, they should call it "Ginger Chicken in Garlic Sauce."The Fried Salmon gave the best presentation as it was served with cucumber and tomato (all dishes, but Pad Thai, are served with steamed rice).  The salmon chunks were thinly coated with tempura and then lightly deep fried; they looked so yummy!  Looks, however, can be deceiving.The salmon meat was relatively tough, yet, crumbly, and it tasted mainly like the inside of a fridge or tupperware.All of the food I tasted (particularly the "Garlic Chicken") was extremely salty, but to their credit, they do give you large portions - with the exception of the Pad Thai, we all took food home.Just a heads up on beverages - they're pricier than most other places of this caliber.  For example, if you want coffee, you're gonna have to shell out $3.50.  Apparently, they think very highly of their coffee.  Perhaps, they use Starbucks brand, therefore, they think they can charge Starbucks prices.  *shrug*This place wasn't terrible and the waiter/owner was attentive, but I won't be going back; I just didn't enjoy the food that much.I would rate this as a two-star experience, but I'm giving it three because when you walk in, you can tell that the owners are trying so hard, but they either just don't know what they're doing (as far as price vs. the competition is concerned), or they think their food is much more delicious than I do.~~#~0
The chilis on mill is always better its downtown tempe right next to asu so crowded is expected. However the service here is so slow we saw our server like twice and we were there for nearly two hours. The food is decent like any other chilis bit man they need to work on their spred.~~#~0
Meh.  This is a 2.5 star review that I've rounded to 3, because 2 seemed a bit too brutal.  Food is expensive for what it is.  Sandwich I had was OK, but iced tea was SO bad, and was clearly out of a tap, not fresh-brewed.  Really?  What restaurant does THAT?  No doubt more expensive than using the "real" stuff, and everyone who had it in our party asked for something else to replace it.  Potato salad was acceptable but kinda supermarket-ish. Not bad, not great, likely won't be back - nothing compelling and lots of good choices in the area.~~#~0
Their food is good, and the sides are good.   Now, on to the big 3:Price:  Pretty typical, and non-effective in correcting the high prices of fast food.  A single diner can expect to pay $8-11 to eat one meal.  I'm guessing that no energy is expended to correct the high prices of one dinner meal.Service:  Everyone I've talked to has been pleasant, and smiling, if even on an only-superficial basis.Taste:  The chicken items taste just like chicken.  It's everything you would expect.  Nothing fantastic.In Summation:  They close as early as 9pm, and ALSO on every Sunday.~~#~0
I was impressed with the ambience, food and service , especially popovers. Side dishes were small and over -priced. Skip dessert nothing special. I might go back for a special occasion.~~#~0
'Berto's in my 'hood! The newest Filiberto's has just opened on the corner of 16th Street and McDowell (what used to be a KFC). We happened to catch them on opening day, and it showed. The cashiers were nice, but a little confused about how to take orders, communicate them to the kitchen, and how to work the cash register. Hubby and I both ended up getting way more food than we actually ordered. Half order of Super Nachos my ass. The Chile Rellenos came as a meal deal, instead of the enchilada we ordered. Hubby felt a little queasy afterward, but it was from the spiciness, he thought. I have since ordered a breakfast burrito through the drive-through on my way to work, and it was just ok. The eggs were overcooked and the cheese not distributed very well. Again, way more than I could eat, but it kept me full 'til dinner. This location is open 24 hours. They accept cash and debit cards, with a 60 cent surcharge. Parking is tight, and slightly scary.~~#~0
Went for lunch we had the bottomless fries to start very hot and good especially with redrobin seasoning salt . We had a huge portion of the chicken parmasian, took home leftovers. We also had the soup and salad, a little pricey plus very little onions in French onion soup. The service was above averge. We frequent this restaraunt every couple months. Always very consistent. Only complaint prices keep climbing, please run some specials or coupons we might come back more often.~~#~0
This Safeway is A-OK.  It is just down the street, which is handy.  Wine? Check.  Almond milk?  Check.  Miso paste?  I'd better go to Sprouts.They have the necessities, and a decent wine selection, but not much else.  I usually go to the one up on Osborn instead.~~#~0
It's a neighborhood store for me.  However, I don't often visit because it is difficult to get into and out of the parking lot.  There's a front lot and a back lot and they both seem to be filled all the time.  The building orientation is a bit odd, it does not face either lot, but instead you walk up a breezeway to get inside the store.  This gives it more of a market feel and definitely sets it apart.There is an extensive Deli/Prepared food area that includes a sushi bar and salad bar. Lunch time can be busy, however, the Deli crew is often surly, slow and unwilling to actually help customers.  The food is just okay, but the service kinda ruins it.  On the plus side, the China Mist iced tea is always fresh.the Bakery has some awesome baked goods, with an extensive selection of pastries.  They often put fresh-baked goods out so the aroma will draw you in and make you spend.  When you get outside, you're like "what just happened there, and where did this napoleon come from?"  But then you eat it and you forget all about your problems.For actual groceries, this is an upscale store, so expect upscale items and prices that go with it.  The layout is very nice and the cashiers are always nice and helpful.~~#~0
Another Gourmet sandwich shop on par with Paradise bakery (or Panera Bread for you those of you not from the valley).  The food is quality, the prices aren't outrageously high, but there's nothing special about the place that makes me need to run back.I stopped in before a spring training game across the street at the Peoria Sports Complex.  Had ham on a pretzel role.  The havarti cheese was unexpected delight from the traditional cheeses you get at most sandwich joints, but the salt on the pretzel role was awful.  While I understand that people like their pretzels salted, I didn't need all that.  After scrapping it off, I enjoyed my sandwich.  The small bag of chips are a welcomed, but unnecessary compliment to the meal.Corner Bakery offers up a nice selection of soups, salads, sandwiches and baked goods.  It's worth checking out if you're in near one.  But its definitely not worth going out of the way for.~~#~0
I really don't like this place for sushi. The fish definitely comes from frozen and there's a lot of imitation crab meat being used. On the other hand, the rice and noodle bowls are excellent. I'll definitely keep coming here but no more sushi. Oh yeah, drinks are always good and there is a quality beer selection.~~#~0
Get ready to throw some elbows and dig through bargain bins.  Last Chance is the "last stop" for all Nordstom merchandise before it goes to the...wait, where does all that leftover merchandise go?  Who knows.  If you have the patience to stomach this place, by all means go.  I picked up a few tank tops for $1.97 and my friend found a James Perse shirt for $3.  So, there ARE deals to be had--mostly on women's jeans, sleepwear, handbags, and shoes.~~#~0
I've been to Texaz grill a few times for their deadly, but pretty darn good chicken fried steak. This past Saturday, I went to grab a bite while my babies got groomed. I sat down at the bar next to a group of bar flies that seemed to be regulars. The conversation was in full swing about politics, which they tried to drag me into but I politely declined and said "I don't discuss politics while trying to digest food."I ordered one of the specials which was a smoked hot link drenched in bbq sauce on a po-boy bun. It was served with coleslaw, but I ordered some Texaz fries with it. The hot link was dry and almost jerky-esque, possibly due to the smoking process, or maybe the links were just old. They were still tasty, and being a girl that is used to smoked meats around the house, I kind of enjoyed eating the semi-dry little discs. I tossed aside the top half of the po boy bun, and just ate the meat with the sauce soaked bottom half of the bun. The sauce was dark, with a smoky sweet flavor. The coleslaw was creamy and the cabbage was finely chopped. The Texaz potatos are chunks of seasoned, and fried potatos. I only ate about 3 or 4 before I was stuffed. As is always the case with Texaz Grill, I wasn't overly delighted, but I wasn't overly disappointed. Texaz Grill is a dive that happens to serve pretty good food! It's nothing fancy, it's nothing sophisticated, but if you're in the mood for meat, or chicken fried steak, head there.~~#~0
I love the organization of the store.  It has very well-defined areas, which made my first trip in a breeze.The store is large and seems to have just about everything one would need, sports wise.  We went in looking for sleeping bags for my 6'6" friend and didn't see any that would work under $100.  Most of their bags are pricey, with kids bags being in the $50 range and adult bags starting at $60 on sale and going up to just under $200 on sale.We did not check out prices on anything else, but this place is a lot pricier than Dick's for similar bags.I will check out this place again because of their selection, but I will definitely look for a coupon first.  A side note: We decided to try our luck at Target and found a bag for adults up to 6'4" for $42.  Since my friend is not in need of a mummy bag, this will work just fine.~~#~0
Went here due to the recommendation for Pad Thai. Place is quiet and kinda nice looking. Was only offered water. Ordered the Pad Thai with Shrimp. Received quite a large helping of food, but I didn't really get much spicy or much spice in general come across. Nice place with a real cheap lunch menu.~~#~0
Union is very cool in theory. I LOVE Royal coffee, so it is nice that they have a second location here (although somewhat redundant since they already have a location at the Biltmore). The little cafe smelled very good. The stores are cute and the set up is interesting...sort of like a public market or something where there are many small counter businesses or storefronts. My problem with Union is that it claims to be all local because the stores are local stores; However, there are items in some of the stores that are simply bought from corporate companies. For example, I tried on some dresses from the cute little clothing store and overheard the owner talking to some random supplier and saying something along the lines of 'Just bring anything, I don't even care.' The brands are not local and the clothes are not locally made. I think if Union really wants to be a 'local' establishment, the businesses should sell locally made, locally sourced items, otherwise it is just indirectly buying corporate made-in- China items. I know some of the stores have put forth a lot of effort to do this (Queen Creek Olive Mill, Frances, etc), which is appreciated, but as a unit, I think they could do more.~~#~0
Wine, wine, wine....cheers!  I couldn't wait to go here.  Our 1st visit unfortunately was a Saturday at 5ish so we just missed HH.  It was packed.  Luck would have it we did get a seat at the bar (party of 4)...BUT, it took quite awhile before we got served.  So bar seating we were not impressed.  We put our name down for a table and the wait was over an hour.  We finally got our table 1.5hrs later. When we finally got our table and order our bottle of wine and food.  The food and wine was great!  Just getting to this point was aggravating.....plus we already spent 75+ bucks before we got seated. I will go back, because I love, love, love the Arcadia location.  I hope it was an off night.Food/wine = 5 starsService that night =2.5/3starts~~#~0
If you're a U of A or Michigan State fan, this is the bar to watch the game. Upper Deck is a decent sports bar in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale. Decent is the common word to describe Upper Deck. The food is decent, the drinks are decent, the prices are decent and the space is decent. On game day, the bar can get pretty crowded so its best to get there before the game you want to watch actually starts in order to secure a seat. The upstairs area has another bar and additonal seating, including some red velvelt couches. On the ground floor, TVs line the walls and a theater TV is on the center wall. So, if your game is playing on that TV it's perfect. I typically only visit Upper Deck on a game day, but in that sense they've got their niche covered because on those, the place is packed. Be prepared to wait for your food and drinks due to the crowds but if you don't mind large crowds and decent (not always so quick) service, I suggest visiting to watch a game. And if possible, you might want to eat before. The food is decent, but it's worth checking out some other spots first and having a snack at Upper Deck.~~#~0
My biggest turn-off was the CASH ONLY posted everywhere. I mean come on, everyone else started to accept debit/credit cards in the 1990's, even McDonalds joined in years ago. Get with the program. I hardly carry cash, as debit/credit cards are much easier to track my spending.The food was OK, I had the Fire Dog with Chilli. The Fire Dog is a "spicy" dog, which is deep fried.  The serving of chilli was skimpy and appeared to lack meat. The sodas are fairly priced compared to other places, and the place was very clean inside.~~#~0
now that the place has been remodeled it is actually looking really good. The beef chimichanga is good, but everytime I get the chicken chimichanga I find a bone in it.~~#~0
This place should be called Taco's Yum.  At least that was my thought after having some of their yummy yummy tacos.  I've had just about every kind now and while I can't say for sure that I have a favorite the carnitas and the fish are totally on top of the list. Mmmm.  Folks I've gone with have done plate food and burritos and both really liked what they've gotten.   Me, I stick to the tacos.  Yummy every single time.  Fresh veggies and herbs.  What's should be cold is cold and what should be warm is warm.  Juicy meat, but not so much so that it soaks totally through the corn tortillas.  I could go on, but really, I think the pictures of the tacos speak for themselves.  And did I mention it's cheap?  Sooooo cheap that I almost felt bad using my 2 for 1 coupon the first time I went.  Of course, I did anyhow.  And let me tell you that a free taco tastes just as good.~~#~0
I am a fried chicken fan. In terms of fried chicken, Lolo's doesn't even make it to my top 10.  Nothing against the shop, which is run by really friendly people, but their yard-bird is not that flavorful once you get past the crunchy, salty, skin.  It may well be the best thing in Phoenix but that's not saying a whole lot.  Now mind you I'm comparing it to the likes of Price's Chicken Coop in Charlotte or the Scotch House in New Orleans - and compared to those esteemed joints - Lolo's is just bland.That said, Lolo's will do you right: good waffles, solid collards, a tasty mac n cheese, grits, eggs.  If it was aiming to be a breakfast joint  it might score higher with me.  And their service is really welcoming.But a drawback is their price.  For being the only game in town - Lolo's will stick it to your wallet.  It's very very easy to walk out of there 40$ lighter for a dinner for two.Next time, I'll stick to the sides.~~#~0
First impression. Not bad. It's a clean place. Staff is friendly. They were blasting some 80's music inside. Not my thing but hey... Lol. So I ordered the Kung Pao chicken. The girlfriend got the Sweet and Sour chicken. I'm always on a mission to find some Kung Pao that can beat Chows Asian Bistro in Albuquerque. Sadly it doesn't top Chows. The food was good don't get me wrong. As stated in a review from someone else. It's good not great. My girlfriend also got a Long Island Iced Tea. She said that was awesome. All in all not a bad place. I'd go here again probably.~~#~0
We met up with some friends for dinner here... keeping an open mind about what to expect.  We're all omnivores, but are always willing to try new things!  This place ended up a mixed bag...Overall, the food is pretty good... but also pretty darned expensive for what you get...Note: We all DID find it pretty comical that a completely vegan restaurant makes all of its food LOOK like animal products (hot dogs, hamburgers, shrimp, chicken - you name it).  If it's really a moral stance... why make it look like you're eating meat?  Shrug.  Must just be a vegan thing we're not hip enough to understand (like the guy at a different table wearing a giant peace symbol on the front of a shirt with Army Sergeant stripes on its sleeves - oh the statement that must somehow make, in his head, that just doesn't come out right in reality).The service is also pretty slow... and the food doesn't come out at once - just makes its way to your table as it gets finished in the kitchen.The desserts, in particular, were pretty magically delicious (fried bananas were out of this world)!Overall...... it was just okay......Good food... great desserts... weird deli seating and vibe... high prices... slow service...... just okay...I think the other couple, we were with, liked it more than my wife and I... but I'm not going to run back, anytime soon, to pay 8 bucks for 6 small pieces of soy protein shaped like shrimp, covered in sauce and placed on a little scoop of rice.  That's just paying extra to still be hungry again in 2 hours (which we all were)......~~#~0
Never been here before. I normally would not shop here but a friend of mine recommended trying it out because you can actually get get cute tops and things here for pretty cheap. So, of course being adventurous, I popped in. I found a couple of things I wanted to try on so I headed to the back where an employee was waiting to count my items before handing me a number and letting me into the fitting rooms. It went quickly to where I found something I liked. Then, I went back out to place the items I did not like back on the rack. Then something else caught my eye...needless to say I ended up doing this 3 times! I thought I had found it all then something would catch my eye again. The dressing room employee probably thought I was either metally slow or just crazy for going back and forth so many times. Oh well, it was a good experience for a cheap clothing store :)~~#~0
Knocking a star off for you Rokerij. Believe me, this hurts me more than it hurts you. I visited last Sunday and our service was friendly, but it didn't make up for the poor delivery of food and the problem with solving issues that we had. I have only had the small plates from Rokerij. This trip I decided to try some of their "New Mexican" offerings.  My appetizer order, which was specifically stated to be an appetizer, not an entree came with my entree. Considering the appetizer did not even have to be cooked (steak tartare), that's unacceptable. When I commented on it I got a "Ugh, I know, right?" Um...really? My entree which was the Rokerij sampler was meh. The best part of the dish was the benedict. The enchiladas were bland and plain old mush.  I had dinner with my best friend Amber, and my good friend Ayesha. Ayesha had me sample her enchiladas as she has specifically asked that she not be served pork. I bit into a bite of pork enchilada off of Ayesha's plate. When the waiter was flagged down, he said "Hm, not sure what to do about this." Really?? Luckily, before I went off like a powder keg, he offered to remake them. He didn't comp anything for the obvious mistakes that were made. I hope he realized that there were some boo-boos made when he saw his tip was so small. I hope to give back the star I just took away, but they're going to have to wow me to do that. It's too bad that this trip was so disappointing.~~#~0
I like Oreganos. For what it is. the service is ALWAYS stellar. they accommodate every type of party that walks in the door. I give any business kudos for that. The food is good. Not GREAT, but good. I've had several items since moving here in January 2012. The portions are absolutely enormous. Be warned. The JR salads are still enough to share. I've had the thin crust pizza, which to me was standard zaa... Good sauce, nice amount of cheese. Standard for a thin crust. The Chicago stuffed was another story.. I was really looking forward to this one since I saw the neighboring table chow down. We ordered a basic pizza with pepperoni, sausage and caramelized onions. It came looking amazing! And it wasn't bad, it was just loaded with so much cheese that it took over any toppings one might like to enjoy. Another minus (for me) was that instead of their nummy sausage chunks it was layered with enormous slices of sausage to the point where besides the sick amount of cheese that was all you could taste. It by no means was inedible but be warned. I wouldn't order it again and it was NOT Chicago style. I've also had their Diablo shrimp pasta dish and sadly it was great the first time and not even spicy the next. I will still eat here as it is a great place to chill and get some grub but if your looking for Chicago zaaaa... find somewhere else...All in all, a good standard place to eat, exremely nice servers and decent food. just not what I want when I think of the good ol Midwest pizza.~~#~0
Hing Loon is a family owned restaurant, and it shows. It's a decent little place for some chinese food. Although it may take more than once to find your favorite plate, it's ok for chinese food. Out of the five times I've been there, once I had my rice burned. I told them about it, and they made some more. It can be kinda pricey, at around $7-9 a meal, it's worth a try if you're in the Glendale Area.~~#~0
J Alexander's has an upscale feel to it, similar to Houstin's but not as "posh" as the Capital Grille. It's New American cuisine all the way.  Five stars for decor and service. There's a glitzy wine cellar and a full bar.  The food is what you'd expect out of a place like this.  It's good, but it wasn't the best meal I'd ever had.  I felt that my dish wasn't made specifically for my order--they cranked them out so fast that I had the impression that the kitchen was more of an assembly line.  On the plus side, we were starving and having food within two minutes was definitely pleasing.   The grilled chicken salad was tasty, but it was overwhelmed with tortilla strips. The spaghetti squash side could've used more marinara sauce, but it was a pleaser.  Then again, who spaghetti squash is pretty hard to screw up.  There seemed to be a lack of communication between servers. Everyone's job included delivering and whisking dishes away, sometimes before we had fully finished the plate.  At one point, a Thai chicken salad was placed in front of me.  After telling the waitress that I definitely did not order this salad, it was taken away to another table.  Hmmmm....It could've been a more "personalized" experience; I was expecting to be blown away by this place.  Meh, I could come back.~~#~0
Let me start by saying that American Apparel makes fantastic t-shirts. I'm a serious t-shirt collector and have been for decades. I pay attention to that type of junk because I was involved in the d.i.y. punk scene as a kid and if you're in a band, printing your own t-shirts was par for the course... From Anvil to Hanes to newer brands like Gildan - I've tried them all. For awhile it looked like Oneita was going to be the last "made in the USA" company around - quality shirts there - but several years ago, they seem to have dropped out. Everything has been pretty much Gildan - tourist shirts and event shirts and anything cheap or free - it's Gildan. You can even pick up some blanks for a couple bucks at Walgreens if you like. The problem with them is that they are totally unreliable fit-wise. They react unpredictably to the drier - sometimes getting wider and shorter or twisting or losing hem threads. They also aren't very soft - they are very heavy, but they aren't very high-end. I realize it seems silly to have a high-end t-shirt, but that's what American Apparel makes. Their shirts always fit perfectly - they are all made exactly the same and they make anyone with a halfway decent body shape look pretty sexy. They are somewhat fitted without being tight. They are all soft and the cotton is combed to a rich and durable state. These shirts don't form holes as easily as other shirts I've owned - even heavier shirts I have form holes near where they rub against my belt buckle... AA do not. Their seams always hold as well.I can easily say that American Apparel are the most reliable and best made blank t-shirt available. When buying shirts online, I only buy prints on AA shirts because I know they'll look great on me. So many online companies now use AA shirts these days as well, so it's easy.So what about this store? What about the rest of it? Well, the store is bright and full of colorful clean blank clothes. On the women's side, there are lots of great skirts and dresses made of soft cotton. Mostly just summer accessories really as nothing here is thick enough to wear as winter cover. It is meant to be layered though as you can see by the mannequins. They have great socks and leggings and I'm told they make the best and most comfortable thongs in the business... so if you are a woman and you want to try some comfy thongs - give these a shot.The men's side is more of a unisex area because apart from the shirts, all of the clothes they sell to men are super gay... and I'm not trying to insult anyone, it's just seriously things that are far too flamboyant for even metrosexuals. They definitely expect you to be rail skinny to buy clothes here although they carry larger sizes. They sell jeans, but they are of the skinny type. Some of the fun of going in here is to look at the gold lamet jackets and telling your friends you are going to buy it to see their reaction. The kids that work here are hip scenesters hired for their look rather than their work ethic. They are all thin and their level of helpfulness varies wildly between 'not' and 'somewhat'. The store is very well-lit and it's easy to find things. The models they use for the advertising and 'artwork' posted around the store look like early-stage bruised up meth addicts or early 70s porn stars. The biggest problem with this store really is simply that their clothing is overpriced. Sure, it's nice and well-made, but it's also expensive. Considering you can buy their blank t-shirts for 3-5 bucks each from online bulk sellers... the exact same shirts they sell in the store for 3-5 times that amount. 60 bucks for a jacket that looks like it would come in a 5 dollar hurricane survival kit doesn't spell value to me. I really think the only good reason to go here would be if you were a girl and you wanted to buy some thongs or socks or leggings or a skirt or dress. If you just want a t-shirt, there are much cheaper ways to obtain them... for both men and women. It's great having an AA location in the valley if for no other reason than to just have it... but a smart shopper can do better.~~#~0
Simply an eh!  I can't get over calling this place gourmet.  The sandwich is okay and pouring cheese sauce on everything doesn't make it gourmet.  Uncle Sams has much tastier steak sandwiches and are more reasonably priced.  I guess it just isn't for me.~~#~0
I did my bachelorette party here it was nice and convenient to be able to stumble from one bar to another. I guess I never noticed the slutty teens that someone else mentioned because I was there after they are allowed out. I can't say much for the shopping because I really never did much of it at this place. I just know that I had fun drunk, and I think its better then the Arizona Center.~~#~0
My burrito bowl had ingredients that were fresh off the grill.  Every single item was grilled, and it made me wonder the oil content.  It was good though.  The complimentary chips were the best part of the meal.  Unfortunately, everything in my bowl was super spicy.  I usually can take the heat, but this was like an inferno!~~#~0
Service was lacking, we were the only people in the place and had to hear about the two gentlemen talk about the schedule for a few minutes before we were even greeted. Ordered two small subs with small drinks and chips. I had a philly style beef with spicy sauce, the Kahuna or something. It was meh, ok. I won't be back because I spent over $20.00.~~#~0
I went for an early dinner and the food was adequate.  The price of the buffet was only $9.50, and you get a $0.50 discount if you show a players club card.  The buffet is on the smaller size, and the decor is really drab and uninteresting, and is typical of a cheap buffet. But this review is on the food, not the decor.  There were not a lot of different food options. There was a soup and salad bar, a dessert bar, and a main course bar. The main course bar consisted mostly of sides, including mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, and mixed vegetables, and a choice of meats including barbecue chicken, flank steaks, which were basically thinly sliced strips of beef, a pork entree with some kind of sauce, and a carving station featuring ham. The best thing on the menu were the flank steaks and the carved ham. The quality of the food was pretty good. It wasn't dry or overcooked; in this sense it was just right. Where it needs improvements is with seasoning. Much of food was quite bland, and definitely needed more seasons. But some of the foods were better than I expected them to be. The desserts were pretty good, consisting a choice of cakes, pies, and ice cream. As for the orange juice, it was very watery. I thought this was because of all the ice that they put into the glass, but it is actually the orange juice itself, as I found out when I asked for a refill with no ice.The service was excellent. The waitress brought drink refills out before I could even ask for one and before I finished my drink. They were also very quick at  busing the tables and picking up dirty dishes.Overall it wasn't too bad. It wasn't excellent, but it wasn't bad either. I would definitely consider coming back.~~#~0
I'm giving Hazelwood's a tentative 3 stars.  It seems as if they've fixed their service issues.  I've been there a few times for happy hour in the past month and they seem to have implemented a team service method.  Still good food and nice cold beer.~~#~0
This was my maiden voyage into Massage Envy.  I received a gift certificate back at Christmas and really wanted to cash it in.  I arrived early to fill out paperwork and to start the relaxation process.  Work has been super busy for the past month or so and I can feel the knots in my back growing.  It's spring and yet I don't have much time to play outside and I feel the "me time" depleting with every passing day.I booked the 90 minute Swedish massage and man did I need it.  The therapist worked on my back for about 75% of the time!  This was the first time I have ever visited a massage therapist and they actually spent so much time on my problem areas.   Maybe this is the first time I have ever really had bad problem areas or maybe this therapist was more in tune with my knots.  Either way I am now more in tune with how much stress I allow to enter my body.  The massage certainly help relieve stress but I never really felt completely relaxed.I am giving this 3 stars based on these 3 things:  1)  The rooms were not very spa like.  They were very basic in design and only had one light on a dimmer.  I suggest several general lights with dimmers, candles and possibly task lighting that could be on a dimmer as well. 2) they did not use aromatherapy as far as candles or oils. 3) As I was paying they tried to sell me a membership.   I am here to relax and not be sold anything extra.  It did help with my back pain but I don't see myself here for a relaxing spa day.  It seems this may not be their target anyway and maybe I just misunderstood what they were all about.~~#~0
It was pretty decent but fell short of the other reviews.  If you have had real Chinese food then this is OK.~~#~0
To be honest, for all the five star reviews that this place has received, I was expecting...better. That's not to say that it was terrible, it just doesn't truly live up to the hype that Yelp has given it. This review is a 3.5. My friends and I came here with a reservation at 5 PM, right when the place opened. Thus, when we arrived, we were the only people in the restaurant. It was nice since we didn't have to worry about being too loud or anything like that. Anyhow, onto the food!Apps: Between the four of us, we got 3 Foie Gras and a Brandade. Make no mistake, the Foie Gras was absolutely delicious, especially when paired with the waffle and grapes. The Brandade on the other hand was simply ok. It tasted like a salmon takoyaki ball. Main Course: We ordered 2 rack of lambs, a steak frites, and the shortrib veal. The lamb honestly wasn't anything special. It seemed a little too gamey to me (for a French restaurant, anyhow). I was expecting something a lot better given its price and the great reviews about the lamb. The Steak Frites wasn't honestly too great either. The steak was cooked well (medium rare) but the taste of the steak was overwhelmed with both a combination of salt and onions. The shortrib veal was very dry but tasted fine once paired with the mashed potatoes. The only downside to this was that I felt like I was eating a Shepherd's pie. Lastly, if you're going with friends, it's much better to have one person pay than it is for everyone to pay individually. They charge a certain % for having to slide 4 credit cards instead of just one -_-. I'd be completely fine with that except they never alerted us of this fact. I only found out once I looked at my statement (they also charged my friends the same amount).~~#~0
The customer service here is pretty good, and so is the selection of products. It's a lot easier to find someone to help you here than it is at Lowe's! They also have a sign up now that says they will beat any advertised price by 10%.~~#~0
Yay for happy hour and half off on cocktails! Have been back to this Stingray for a few times now, mostly for happy hours and one time for lunch, experiences were pretty consistent. Happy hour value for half off on their specialty cocktails and some sushi rolls were very nice, other tapas like crispy calamaris were just a-ok, nothing very special. Really liked the lunch bento boxes!For some reasons, this place is always very loud, ignore the bar area, even by the inner side of the dinning room, it's still very noisy, so if you are looking for quiet place, this isn't your choice...~~#~0
This place is very Cute. I was able to have a delightful brunch here. Based on the reviews I somewhat expected more. The food is a solid 2.5 -3, but the place is cute and homey and I guess that is what makes it so quaint.  My friend told me there are plenty of baby showers and bridal showers and I can see why. It's like being in a small cottage- eating with friends.  The waitress that day was not so attentive and we had to flag her down a couple of times.  My warm chicken salad was Blah.. but my friend's  Crepe , from what I remembered was Very Tastey.. The desserts were cute, but nothing extraordinary.. overall the place is for the ambiance and for company with friends, on a  brunch out ting.. but if you are to do a real brunch I say head to the Hotel Brunches for all you can eat.. a little more on the price, but alot more appetizing.. especially if you are on vacation!~~#~0
Good Mexican food on the go.I get my lunches from here every now and again.  Very satisfactory food, but the drive-through speaker is kinda scary.~~#~0
Since it's pricey here, I just get the kids meal. The burger is pretty much the same size as the all American. The fried pickles are pretty good. I would rather go to IN n OUT though.~~#~0
My husband and I used to frequent the Keegan's in Ahwatukee, but we have moved from that area and are slightly closer to this Camelback location. We ate breakfast at this location for the first time yesterday.I found the service to be a bit slow, but our server was very polite and accomodating.I ordered the cinnamon brioche french toast. I would go as far to say this is the best french toast I have ever eaten. It was so moist and tasty! I like the set up of the Ahwatukee location better. The bathrooms at this location are not as nicely kept as the 'tukee location.I'll definitley be back for Sunday brunch again for some of that great french toast and hope to check it out for dinner some night. Keegan's usually has some good, home cooking dinner specials, so when I'm too lazy to cook my own meatloaf I'll head here on a Monday night.~~#~0
How to review a theatre? Hmmm...well....I never waited in line to use the restroom. Gotta love that. The bartenders seem to know their stuff, until I asked for a Patron shot to be chilled and he said the Patron wasn't on ice. Oh. Really? Hey, barkeep, how's about using that metal drink shaker behind you? Brilliant. Thanks Larry. The video screens were a bit snowy for my tastes and sadly, being in row 35, they were needed as I couldn't see Margaret Cho everytime she pointed to her vagina. Which was frequently. Acoustics were great as I heard her sniffle at least a couple of times. I didn't enjoy that, mind you, but I kept thinking, "hey, the acoustics are really great". I did the pre pay parking thing for $14 but arrived early enough that it wasn't necessary. But, hey, I spent an extra $4 and got to say to the attendent, "I prepaid online, here's my coupon". Lame. I know. It's the little things people! I'm prime for my next Dodge experience, but will try to secure tickets closer to the stage.~~#~0
Went there with a big group for the late night specials.  It could have been the alcohol-induced carb cravings... but the pasta was really delicious.  The martinis were potent to say the least, but hey, better that then watered down.  The waiter was really nice and our food came out quickly.  All in all it was a really great experience.~~#~0
We never felt welcome from the time we entered the door to when we left.  Maybe the waitress was having a bad day?  we were there on a very cold day and at lunch time.  We asked if they had Miso soup - her response was as thought we were Martians "this is a Japanese restaurant we don't have soup"  Duh!!!Food was ok but overpriced.  the steamed bun was good but could have used a  small salad portion on the plate.The music didn't go with the restaurant at all.Overall not a great experience I doubt we will be back.~~#~0
I am a sucker for themed restaurants and fell in love with Alice Coopers organized chaos.  You first walk through a gated, sports themed, outdoor dining area.  It has a bunch of picnic tables, a concession stand, basketball hoop and flags blowing overhead...very cool! As you enter, you are greeted by a face painted Alice Cooper hostess, then realized that all of their employees have their face painted like Alice Cooper! The restaurant itself is engulfed in paraphernalia.  A little chaotic but I wouldn't expect anything less.  It is definitely more a bar than restaurant and the food proved the same. First time dining at Alice Cooperstown, we had to try the "Big Unit"! When ordering this monster, you must be prepared for a loud delivery! They ring the bell and yell "biiig uniiit" when delivering it to your table! Awesome! There are two options when ordering the big unit.  The original is simple and served without fries.  The second is an "Adam Richmond" inspired creation, drenched in toppings and paired with fries, so we got the Adam!  Whoa Baby! This thing was 2 feet long! ...did my fiance and I finish it all? Almost! We left about half a foot and called it quits.  We did eat all of the fries.  The fries were good but the dog wasn't anything special.  You mainly order the "Big Unit" if you have a big appetite or are looking for an entertaining experience.The overall menu is filled with movie and sports inspired entrees.  Mostly fried items with a few pasts dishes.  They have a weekly happy hour with standard offerings on specific days, so you can plan accordingly! Large flat screens cover the entire bar so that, no matter where you are seated, you'll have a comfortable view!~~#~0
The food was good - brisket and ribs and mac and cheese.  Good sangria too.  But it is over priced for BBQ, but it is an interesting twist in that is it a little bit BBQ and Mexican - maybe the restaurant  still finding its way.Service was good, but due to pricing, we will not have it on our list of must go backs~~#~0
As a person that travels a lot, I have really come to appreciate some very simple things.  The return of the "nickle and dime" program is really something I don't enjoy.I think all of those fees need to be included and disclosed up front.  The efforts some hotels and resorts go to in order to make your rooms very quiet is something else I think we all appreciate.At this Kimpton FireSky location I could hear the water flowing from some pipe and the neighbors door open and close.  I don't know what pipe it was, but every once in a while I could just very clearly hear running water.  That doesn't happen at a lot of better hotels and resorts as I expected this to be.  At the end I was in a hurry to catch a flight and only made sure there were no over charges for meals and the room rate was right.  I ignored the rest of the items.  Hotels have made me numb to them with all of the different taxes and resort fees.When I got home and read the bill, I just felt embarrassed for paying the bill.  Rarely do I stay anywhere with a "resort fee".  When I made the reservation I was assured there was not one.  Somehow the FireSky took this to a whole new level I didn't expect.  There were extra charges for a $2.00 daily housekeeping gratuity, and a $7.00 bell gratuity.  I arrived after Midnight because of traffic so the only thing the bell hop did for me was say good-bye from the stand as I drove off.Over all the food and location are very nice when visiting Scottsdale Arizona. You can walk downtown and they have a shuttle so you don't feel like you are trapped eating resort food.  Because this was a work trip, breakfast, lunch and one dinner were enjoyed on the patio,  the Traggia restaurant was very good and not priced much higher than places in town.The pools are pretty cramped but still pretty nice.  The bottom line is I won't be back.  Of the three places I have stayed in Scottsdale, this one is three of three.This is almost a 3 1/2 star because of the restaurant and pool staff.~~#~0
This was the first time in my life that I spent $125 on dinner and left hungry. The food is delicious but the portions are really small and expensive. I had a shaved fennel salad, butternut squash ravioli and lemon cake as well as a bottle of wine.We waited an hour to be seated, but I didn't mind. We sat at a table outside near a heater and drank some wine. We could have been seated earlier, but we wanted a private table instead of a seat at the communal table. I was a bit disappointed that they charged for bread and oil/vinegar for dipping. I think  this should be provided at every Italian restaurant for free, especially considering the prices and small portions for the rest of the food.The server was very nice and gave great recommendations regarding the food. When the bill came, we told her that the bottle of wine was missing on the bill, and she didn't even say thanks for letting her know, which I thought was strange, since it was an extra $40. All in all, this place was ok, but I probably won't go back.~~#~0
I dont mind drifting into Drift every once in a while for some pre-debauchery drinks if I have the extra cash.  I like the vibe there, the patio is comfortable and the bathrooms have great sinks.  And you know how I feel about great sinks in bathrooms.  In the winter the patio is especially nice because they have huge torches which warm it up a bit.  The crowd is pretty touch and go...I've been a few times where I'm the tallest person in the place (SO annoying...I realize I'm 5'10 but dear God did none of you take vitamins growing up?),  while other times I'm pleasantly surprised by the Drift talent pool.  Aside from happy hour, drinks are tasty but pricey.Grab some confidence (and your wallet) , stoll past the gawkers at the door, and you will probably like what you see at Drift.  If not, head to the bathroom, the sinks never underdeliver.~~#~0
I went there last Wednesday night.  Actually before coming to this trendy/ hip sushi place I went to Kyoto. However, my favorite chef at Kyoto in Old town scottsdale was not there so I just left.Sapporo is a hip and trendy place. I live in South bay California but I don't see this type of hip sushi joint in calif. I didn't expect alot for this place. It's pricey. I sat at the sushi bar. I had asked for the sashimi combo. The typical stuff...salmon....red snapper....octopus....you know. the usual. It was ok. Not  too bad but not that good either. Fish freshness is decent only.  It costs about $24 before tax and tips. I don't think I will go back. The sushi chef Darren is cool thoughIf your intent is to hang out and people watch....this is the place to be. For real sushi....i'd say kyoto is better~~#~0
Cool little place with a fun atmosphere. Stopped in for lunch and the food was good and the portions were fine as well. Has that old western tourist feel to it with memorabilia on the walls. Friendly staff took good care of us. I'd certainly swing back by if I were in the area, especially at night, the bar looked pretty cool!~~#~0
Really cute place that's very clean and well-maintained.I ordered a watermelon and mint paleta that was... okay. It was definitely refreshing, but I wasn't really a big fan of the large mint chunks. The other flavors look really good, though, so I think I'll definitely be heading back since it's all natural and won't make you feel bad in the morning.Love the cute stickers!~~#~0
Hit or miss.  My gyro was really good although I had to seriously hunt for the tzsiki sauce but my guest's pasta & grilled chicken salad, although large, fresh and good looking had absolutely no flavor. Maybe they forgot to put the dressing on the pasta??~~#~0
Yesterday I spent the day at the Snedigar Sportsplex baseball fields. My son played on Field #6 for 2 games. We were at the park for about 5 hours and all I can think about is DIRT!  My eyes and throat are still agitated and I was not enjoying the day yesterday with the breeze blowing dirt every which direction. The baseball fields are fine, nice even, but I'm not getting over the amount of dirt we took in.  Nothing is paved - there are NO SIDEWALKS. Even the dugouts are loose dirt.  It's miserable.~~#~0
We waited for over half hour to be seated, we asked what the delay was since everyone else was getting seated and the hostess had crossed our name off the list. Though we were sitting right in front of her. Even the manager Sharon did not question why we had not been called. They just kept seating everyone else.  Waiter Ken was a delight, and very friendly, he made up for the long wait, food was great, perfect portions and strawberry crepes were very tasty.~~#~0
Friendly staff.  Good sushi.  One of my favorites was the Guilty Pleasure Roll:  spicy tuna, covered with Hawaiian white tuna, jalapeno, garlic, tobiko, nuts, eel sauce, spicy mayo and creamy wasabi sauce.  We asked if they could make us a spicy salmon roll since it wasn't on the menu, but they said they couldn't.  I find that really weird.  Anywhoo, skip the cheesecake tempura and get the chocolate mochi.  It's yummy!~~#~0
As a Chicago native, I am really picky about my Chicago cuisine....I normally frequent the lukes on ray and the 101, but decided to try this one since I'm working in phoenix now...I was thoroughly disappointed...had to ask for extra relish and mustard since there wasn't much on the hot dog...the chili cheese fries were just ok and I swear they male them differently at the one in chandler....~~#~0
Nothing special.  Overcrowded buffet.  Old and dingy.~~#~0
This is the first time I ever went to Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville.  What can I say?  How about I spell it? T-A-C-K-Y!!!!!  The place just oozed with ... I don't know how to put it.  Remember when you first saw the Alien in Alien and it was all slimy.  That's how I felt walking in.  I felt dirty and weird.  The food however was tasty.  I enjoyed the Jambalaya.  The bathrooms were clean.  My feet never stuck to the bathroom floor which is a plus in my book.  I'll have to see if they have take out because I can't go back.~~#~0
After all the hype I had heard about this place I was really expecting something special. What I got instead was above average but failing to live up to the hype.Tried both the house special (pretty much a supreme pizza) and the philosophers pie. The special was good and the ingredients fresh. The crust was awesome on both. It was the philosophers that was the let down. It just didn't seem to work and the feta was just too strong.The service however was great and they have a solid draft beer list as well. I will probably come back but this isn't a must stop for me.~~#~0
3.5 stars. Decent service, prices on delicious food ( the artichoke dip app is amazing!) It was the little things (like silverware at our table and regular checkbacks from our server) that made it less than 5 stars. Also, the appearance of some scantily clad women ( on a chilly Sunday afternoon no less) with loud voices and awful facia plastic surgery  was a little odd. At any rate my group of 6 ladies met for an annual magazine club (we have no time for fictional books as many of us are in grad school) and the place was perfect. Good live music too.~~#~0
I can't eat gluten anymore so while I used to eat here......now I go for other people who live with me!  It's good, fast and convenient food.  This location is always fresh because it's so busy.  The staff is great and they make Chinese take out less of a chore!  It's all good.~~#~0
Heres the thing, I love thier coffee but not when they make it. I used to hate this place till a friend gave me a free bag. When I made it like a normal human does it is the best coffee I have ever had. 1 tblspn of coffee grinds to 1 cup coffee, best way. The actualy instruct you to use almost double. Pikes placeis the freshest coffee ever. It comes from the plant to the store in a garunteed 14 days. It is way fresher than the rest and very very good when you make it.I give them 3 stars because, while they put such care and standard into thier coffee, they carlessly poison you with the pastries. They get them from a local vendor. Its loaded with trans fat and saturated fat the light scones have around 1300 calories in one. When they place the nutrition facts on the sign with the name of the pastery or make them with real oil, they will earn those 2 stars back from me.~~#~0
Now that I'm a mom,  I have one tiny bone to pick with this spot. There is no changing table in the bathroom. Not cool people! Mom's go to sushi with babies. Please have a changing table in your restroom. I had to dash out, before my food came, and walk to the public restroom across the street. So inconvenient.The food was good. I'm new to sushi, so I don't have much to compare it to.The crunch rolls and California rolls were tasty. The presentation leaves much to the imagination. A styrofoam plate isn't exactly what I'd like to eat off of, never mind how it will rot in a landfill until the apocolypse.It did take a long time to get our food-but this only made me think they took extra care to make it right, so it's not a complaint, just an observation. If you're in a rush, this might not be the right place to eat.~~#~0
I have to agree with this other reviewers and I wonder if the success of Chompie's may have taken on more than they could handle? I think the food is pretty good, really I think the bagels are probably the stars. But like the others, I felt like we waited an awfully long time to get our meal and the waitress never came to check on us once. I would have liked another cup of coffee but she wasn't even the one who brought our food. I really think that the place seems like it is chaotic and just has way too much going on at one time.~~#~0
I have been to My Wine Cellar a few times since the change in ownership and I have to say I'm still not sure what to think. I love the idea of a cozy wine bar just a few blocks from my house and that is what this place seems to be. I walk in and the atmosphere is quite cozy and even though there is not a huge crowd of people. The bar is usually full enough and everyone is chatting and appears to be having a good time. Even though the staff is welcoming, I still get this feeling like I'm an "outsider" and not quite a "regular" yet. Can't really place my finger on why.The happy hour prices and selection for beer and wine are fantastic! Full price would be a little more than I would like to spend, but then again I love a good deal so anything "full price" just seems like I'm missing out. We used Living Social coupon a few days before the expiration and were a little bummed that the coupon wasn't good for the happy hour prices. I know this is somewhat typical, however that just makes the restaurants that DO allow the coupons during happy stand out that much more!In the time that I have had food (after the ownership change and before), I think it is obvious this place is all about the wine and the food is an afterthought. Nothing wrong with that. I think it is necessary to offer food if you want people to stay and drink a while; we've got to have something to snack on! Bruschettas, thin and crispy pizzas, and salads all with great descriptions on the menu, but the execution leave a little to be desired. Some of the appetizers taste like I could have just gone to Trader Joe's or Costco and purchased the same thing myself.I promise I am not trying to make this sound bad, I will go back to the wine cellar when I want to relax (but not at home, but not too far away either) with a good glass of wine and a calm, cozy atmosphere. I do like to go there, but I think I like the idea more than the reality. It seems as if there is some unrealized potential at the wine cellar, or maybe that is just the optimist in me. The lesson here is that I will be sure to go during the "happy" hours and I won't go when I'm hungry.~~#~0
Nothing better than a restaurant that opens up to Arizona's beautiful fall weather.  Wish I'd had time to hang out on the couch out front after dinner. The hummus platter appetizer was definitely better than any I've had.  The homemade pickles on the platter and on my lamb burger were delicious--remind me of my grandma's in Iowa!   I would have given them 4 stars, but after filling up on the flatbread and hummus, I ate less than half my dinner and had them box up the leftovers. Should have been a red flag when the gal took multiple plates back to the kitchen. What a bummer to open my box this morning hoping to see lamb burger and fries and see somebody else's leftovers. Not only am I mad, but whoever got mine will be disappointed too. One mistake--two unhappy customers! I suggest they bring the boxes to the table or have the staff label them.~~#~0
Better than we expected.We stopped in fairly late on Tuesday night and it was still quite busy.  There were three of us and we ordered the lamb vindaloo, a lamb special, sag paneer and naan.   We requested them "chef spicy," which our charming waitress informed us was as hot as it gets.  We were delighted to discover that this was actually quite spicy.Both lamb dishes were excellent.  The naan was fresh and hot from the oven.  My only quibble was with the saag paneer which was heavy on the saag and light on the paneer, but still pretty good.It's a bit pricey for a neighborhood Indian joint - about $60 for the three of us with one beer, but it's also a bit nicer than the typical Indian restaurant.   Service was friendly and efficient.We'll be back.~~#~0
I'm not quite sure how to rate this place as there are two distinct things I loved about it and two distinct things I hated about it.Let's start off with the good news:The food here is great. Giant, juicy, stacked, mega burgers, insane Mac&Cheese combos and good sides. The other great thing is the beer selection (I know it's a krappy beer, but I love it when I stumble into a place that carries the Little Yella Pils, sorry). Lots of good local beers to choose from.Ok, now for the bad parts. Our server could not stop putting her hands on my boyfriend. Now don't misread this as me being even remotely territorial, but there are boundaries. A hand on the shoulder once or twice I would have simply written off, and especially at a place like Hooters or Tilted Kilt where part of their job is to be flirty with customers, but on around the 4th or 5th pass it was getting eerie, especially on the one where she ran her hand across the top of his back as she walked by us, without even stopping at our table as a result. This isn't that type of a restaurant, first of all.And secondly, we go out to eat with each other ALL THE TIME, almost every day and I have never, ever seen a server touch any customer the way she was getting on him. I used to wait tables myself and I sort of shudder at the thought of touching anyone like that, even if I thought it would get me a bigger tip.The 2nd bad thing was that this isn't the first time we've been here, the first time our food (it's just burgers, come on) took well over 40 minutes or so to come out. We had to get it to go because we were getting pretty crunched for time at that point.So: food is good, but insanely slow; drinks are good, but our server was overly handsy, and it was a very one-sided affair (ie: she barely even acknowledged my existence).~~#~0
The sub contents were good but the. Bread they use is very average!~~#~0
Frybread was really light and fluffy and golden and straight from the hot oil. The lamb stir fry was great, plenty of vegetables and the lamb was tasty with little marblings of fat. I thought about adding a touch of salt but was actually happy to have a meal that wasn't over-seasoned. My wife tried the lamb sandwich and enjoyed it. Same great frybread. It was a quiet Saturday lunchtime. Our server was quiet, polite and friendly. Making fry bread fresh always takes a few minutes but there was no special delay. I liked their lemonade too. The frybread wrapped in white paper reminded me of eating fish and chips where I grew up in England :-)~~#~0
BBQ in Gilbert, AZ....hmmmm. I was skeptical at first, but this place was good.  There was a line to the door, so that was a good sign.  I decided to play it safe and get a chopped brisket sandwich and side.  It was tasty, and a I got a good portion size for the price.  The decor is done well, and they have lots of outdoor seating which we enjoyed because the weather was nice. I can see coming here with a large group and having fun at an outside table.  My side was the cheesy potatoes, and I think it was a little dry.  Overall, it's good BBQ.  I can't really give it four or five stars because we have many places in Texas that are better, but Joe's will give you a good meal at a good price.~~#~0
{Actual Date of Visit: 11/22/11}I went here with some friends at the suggestion of a classmate who is native to New Mexico.  I had tex-mex food when I was last in N.Mexico and loved it.  I had the Garden Enchilada which was tasty.  I appreciated the fact that they had some nice veggie options and in different sizes.  The Daiquiri was outstanding!  My friend loved her Chorizo Stuffed Chicken but the chili pepper mashed potato was dry.  The waiter was cute and very personable.  He traded out our traditional salsa for the bean dip which was yummy!  Overall it was a good experience, but I would have to go back and try more things to see their range.~~#~0
Wanted to like it.  They were out of several items I wanted to try.Can't say it was terrific.  Service was friendly, but preparation was slow.  Food was nothing to write home about.  Might go again to try the items they were out of: black cod, abalone, hamachi.~~#~0
I can dig this place.  There is a bunch of those Asian waving cats decor here.  What's up with that?  And they're all waving at me --- make them stop!  Lunch special was decent.  I generally can't eat a lot of sushi and the lunch special was a little much for me :(  I have the tendency add a little too much wasabi with my soy sauce and boy does it burn.  Service was okay I wouldn't say it was Bam & Pow!  However, I really didn't expect much.  Price was fair compared to many sushi places around town.  Location of Hana is a little odd so I gather they only do well during lunch and take-outs.  In any case, if you live around that area and don't want to travel too far for some sushi Hana is the place to go - Enjoy!~~#~0
Had lunch here last week with Rand H and Mike C.  I love the building and the grounds, the building was just like being in someone's house.  The staff was friendly and service was excellent.  But the food?  Not so much.  I had a Cobb salad; the field greens did not seem all that fresh, some pieces were soggy and looked old.  Instead of being topped with fresh chicken, there were cut of pieces of deli turkey, you know the chopped pressed and formed deli turkey.  The balsamic dressing was very good.  For $9.25 for a salad I was expecting so much better.What I did love was the bread pudding.  Caramel sauce, apples and topped with real whipped cream, but at $5.50 just a little on the pricey side even for the very large portion.  I might stop in again if I was in the area for bread pudding and coffee, but nothing seemed interesting enough for a return visit.~~#~0
A-OK.Yup.Look, I love movies. I am a movie theater junkie. I try to see 1-2 moves in the theater a week and have no problems getting up early and watching 2 movies in a row at Camelview or the cheap and amazing Pollak on Elliot in Tempe. So excuse me if I don't jump up and down in excitement over some of the worst British "comedies" in history being played at the worst times imaginable on Mill Ave. I swear, I will watch anything...yet somehow this theatre manages to pick the worst of the indies, the most boring documentaries, the most "rollicking" UK butler humour...my god, my blood pressure soars thinking about the poor choice in reels.BUTThere is fleeting hope. I had an early date w/Mustachio to see the movie "Once" and we shared a "moment". For Halloween we saw "Let the Right One In" which tears Twilight in a thousand pre-pubescent vampire pieces-christ that movie is brilliant.And last night I dressed Mustachio in a pink blazer, put a purty dress and watched my favourite movie "16 Candles". Is it wrong to love this movie? Yes. A thousand times yes. But I never thought I would see it on the big screen, curled up w/my own Jake Ryan, my buck Harkins Cup and popcorn in comfortable seats for 5 bucks a pop.Whoa??!?As Billy said, if they played more classic fare for 5 bucks, they would need a frequent visitor club card for me not to go broke supporting shit I could netflix...but don't feel like it.If the managers read this, please please please pick better movies to show at this venue, advertise them better and have more midnight movies! And old ones too! Cut.~~#~0
If you're in need of pho in Tempe and can't make it to Khai Hoan, Pho Nhat isn't bad. Now, it's definitely not the best pho that I've ever had, but it does the trick. One thing I find very interesting is the sauce that is served with the spring rolls. I've had a lot of different variations of peanut sauce, but Nhat's is pretty different. It's almost like a peanut/bbq sauce. I liked it. So again, if you're by ASU, like pho and don't really have transportation to other Vietnamese spot, you may enjoy Pho Nhat.~~#~0
A quick lunch with a friend and this place wasn't bad.  I was surprised that it was very empty on a Monday shortly after 12 for the lunch rush?  I did my Usual which was Fish Taco's that were very good.   My Friend had the Maria Maria Burrito which was enough for two! The meal started with Fresh chips and Three different Salsa offerings.  This was mice since you usually only get one!  Service was good and the place was clean~~#~0
OK -- so the layout of this Chili's is pretty cool.  It's 3 stories, and it has a unique 'cozy' feeling to each level.  If you want to talk to somebody here, It's good if you're not here during lunch -- it can get a little loud.  I'd recommend coming around 11:00 or after 1:00 to avoid the crowds.  The food here is average.  I recommend the burgers or the fajitas here.Contrary to what you might think, this place is a chain resturaunt, and it's NOT famous for its chilis.  Wait staff is 'fair to midland'.  They won't go out of their way to please you, but they don't stash you in a corner and forget about you, either.~~#~0
I guess if a rowdy place on the 17 is your place, then you'd like this one. I was here for a gig ( a lot of my reviews seem to have that in them. What can I say? I'm pretty funny.)They have several TVs for your football needs. I was here on a Monday night and the crowd was pretty attentive to us comedians. A lot of support from the venue helped with that.Though I didn't get it, they have a pretty cheap steak dinner. It definitely smelled good! Bartenders were attentive and friendly. They remembered my drink throughout the evening.Oh, and if you see a guy there who looks like Snoop's chubby, poor cousin, do NOT make eye contact. Guy waited for me outside the bathroom door! Creepy, but luckily I had comics there to save me.~~#~0
Well, the food is GREAT...the service is only so, so. Our waiter was nice but we had to wait about 10-15 mins for waters and my husband has too awkwardly "wait" by the door for a restroom to open..which was weird...we had the french onion soup which was awesome and the BBQ sandwich was great too. We also ordered the gin and tonics. It was a bit overpriced in my opinion, by about 20%. The set up at the place is a little strange...I hate sitting at a table in the middle of the room, especially when the room feels like your house...but I'll be back.....~~#~0
Good food. We have had a lot of Indian food in Montreal and in the UK. This one is above average by international standard s. The service though is a bit disorganized and I would the belly dancer and the loud music for something more quaint. But overall worth repeat visits~~#~0
I don't really know about the Ghost Lounge. It seems like it doesn't really know what it wants to be. I have only ever been on Saturday nights, and I always get a weird vibe from it. The lounge itself is huge, but there are never very many people here, save for some groups that maybe just wandered in after walking around and hearing the music. There is always a DJ on Saturdays, and if memory serves me correctly, it is usually a mix of Top 40 hip-hop. There is a decent-sized patio out front with a nice mister system, but then there is an enormous dining (?) area that is always dark with random tables pushed to the sides of the room, decorated with tourist-y pictures of Old West Arizona. I dunno what this part is about but it always just feels lonely. The bartenders, drinks, beer selection and prices are all great, but I just don't feel like this bar offers anything very special in comparison to some of its nearby competitors.I have been here a few times and it is never the destination bar. We always wind up here after A: a night of bar-hopping and wanting one final drink before we head home, or B: when neighboring Seamus McCaffrey's is too crowded to get a drink.~~#~0
I'm kind of middle of the road when it comes to Z.  I think they're OK for happy hour, though their drinks aren't that great of a deal, but you don't need too many either.  Ada G. is addicted to their Chambord Margaritas and recreates them at home for us too.  As for their other food.  I've had a salad I liked and some apps were good but I've generally been a little disappointed with the rest.  My friend B's husband used to be a bartender at Scottsdale so once upon a time, we put in many Friday nights at the bar, sampling the wares.  Nowadays I just go for a "normal" happy hour and I'm not having to drive back to her house Sunday afternoon to get my car.  I'd have to say it's a much kinder, gentler approach.  Try them for happy hour.  Sit on the patio, enjoy the weather (unless it's summer) and have a margarita and some tostada bites.  I think you'll enjoy it.~~#~0
I always enjoy the Kung Pao Shrimp here.  I like that you can order it steamed instead of fried and that the vegetables are always fresh.~~#~0
Being a lazy bum who doesn't want to wash his own truck, and having sworn off Danny's and their army of overly aggressive windshield replacement sales goobs, I took the advice of some Tweeters and rolled into Los Olivos. The $15 wash was more than adequate but the real experience value came from what Los Olivos didn't do: They didn't try to upsell me and nobody messed with my seats. Seriously, don't touch the seats. I would recommend Los Olivos because my vehicle was clean, the people were nice, and they aren't associated with Danny's Carousel in any way. And that's enough.~~#~0
Solid cafe style option when you've dropped from all the shopping nearby.  My only complaint is that lamb gyro featured lamb sausage patties instead of the long strips you expect in a gyro.  Nice taste but I wish this had been advertised.  Breakfast potatoes were very good.  The salads are huge; like maybe a whole bag that you buy at the grocery store in a bowl.~~#~0
Really? Four and a half stars?  I went there yesterday and was sadly disapointed.  It could be just me, but I didn't see any brand names, and a lot of the clothing just looked cheap.  I would love to see a great place to buy designer used clothing.~~#~0
Went there Sunday for lunch. Very nice beer selection. Menu for lunch is very small.  Not sure why for a Sunday with games on TV, why isn't there some finger food? Simple platter with some chips,peanuts,olives,wings...??? Definite minus. Waitress were very nice but seemed a bit confused and/or slow. The cook screwed up  the order which took even longer to rectify.  Why do you call everything with a funny name? Just call it a burrito since this is how the waitress is going to explain it to the customer anyway....Last, it was about have way full and the noise level was high. Can't imagine how high it gets when they are full. Must look into putting some form of noise abatement.~~#~0
I have attended a B-day dinner with J on a Friday night.  This time around was better.  At least, we got our foods a lot quicker.  The appetizers were good combo.  The fish patties were the best.  I had ordered the BBQ chicken since last time they were out.  The chicken was too dried and salty for me.  I have better BBQ chickens at other Thai places.  As for the service, they still need work on it.  At first the waitress attended to our large group, but when it was time to pay, somehow she seems not to like us.  Maybe, it was the coupon I gave her for the wine after the bill came.  I showed her the coupon before ordering so she knows to discount the bill.  Of course, she forgets to discount it.  It took at least 15 to 20 minutes for them to recalculate the bill for us.  The kiddies were getting a little loud.  I had the feeling that they wanted to kick us out.  When we walked out, there was no Thank you or Goodbye.  I'm still a fan of food not the service. I am dropping a star for their service.~~#~0
I wouldn't advise any health nut go here but if you want some cheap super yummy HUGE taco's with frybread wrappers?   Hit it up!The ladies working were really nice and the price was pretty fair.I felt like a peace pipe afterwards... no really... okay no I didn't but it was really good.~~#~0
I was so happy when Vaqueros expanded to this location. The same people who own the one on 18th Ave and Southern also own this one! This is an easy place to get good traditional Mexican food for lunch. The burritos are always quickly served and are humongous for the price. If you dine in, there are free chips available. I usually get the beef taco combo which is consistently good and includes moist refried beans and rice. This isn't a very fancy place but it's sure to curb your Mexican food cravings. PS- They make a killer Super Nacho/Fry (which should be shared unless you plan on going into cardiac arrest).~~#~0
I really wanted to love this place, but unfortunately I didn't. Went with the husband, child and friend on a Friday night. From the looks of it they do a banging take out business for there was a steady stream of people coming and going. I ordered the ceviche, the husband and his friend both ordered carne asada burritos and a bean an cheese burrito for the son. The ceviche wasn't really what I would call ceviche. It was more like chopped shrimp with pico de gallo, cucumbers and chips for dipping. Tasty but not really the ceviche that I am used to and not worth the price. The bean and cheese burrito had a really good taste but as soon as my son took his first bite most of the beans ran out and he was left with a soggy tortilla. The beans would most definitely be a hit as a side with dinner or in a cup, but not in a tortilla. The carne asada was also good but the burritos were small in size, again not really worth the price. The service was friendly and the patio on a nice night is great. Maybe I was expecting some of the best Mexican Food I had ever eaten from reading previous reviews. The food was good but I think for the quantity of food you get it's a little overpriced, I know some are going to disagree and say it's about quality not quantity, and I agree with that to an extent. I would go here again if I had a hankering for some Mexican and was in the Melrose area.~~#~0
*Torn about this spot. The radish cakes were chock full of goodies but served off a plain non heated cart which just about cancels out the yum factor for me. Pork dumpling ,again tasty just ice cold off the same cart. I should have known better, but service was sporadic and I felt somewhat ignored, so impulsively chose something I knew wouldn't be hot. My bad.Some of the dumpling wrappers stuck to the metal steamers off the hot cart which made them hard to tackle. Veggies were good and hot which was a highlight. First steam cart go around chicken feet were gone already and they had just started service, this seemed odd to me. No worries as I soon spied another cart. Since this isn't my first rodeo I know to get up and get them myself, no biggie, just bring your card along. Downright felt like a fish out of water though as my actions were somewhat questioned. Not sure if it was due to expecting a large crowd the following day for a holiday but service was not good. Almost felt unwelcome. Shame though as the chicken feet were some of the best I have sampled in town. Spicy, with a great depth of flavor. Same could be said about the tripe. Cooked well, extremely fragrant with ginger and scallion and just the right amount of texture. Divine. No fry cart however. Every dim sum joint that I felt was worthy of great praise has a fry cart or two on which they would heat up the cakes and assorted applicable offerings. So I am torn. Many of the offerings were tasty but cold, which goes against every core of my being. * This was a tough review to finish, started a few weeks ago, and I have since discovered Xanadu. However, if you are dead set on staying in this area, this is a distant, but solid second choice.~~#~0
OK, I am spoiled. I have had really great Mexican food being from Southern CO, living in SOCAL and working in Albuquerque, so... The Old Pueblo Cafe is "OK" Mexican food. But this is a biased opinion. I think in the west valley it is probably one of the best "sit down" places. The food is usually pretty good, prices are very reasonable and the homemade salsa is GREAT. The atmosphere is what really makes it a spot I go back to often. The staff is always friendly, fast and accommodating. Plus, in a West Valley World of Chains and bland taste buds, this locally owned, unique restaurant set on a quiet, neat little street is a breath of fresh air!~~#~0
Decent food but was totally dead inside at 6pm on a Thursday.  Cant really think of anything they offer that I cant get elsewhere in South Phoenix.  Had some chips and salsa and a green chile pork burrito.  Good homemade flavor to it.~~#~0
I enjoy the bar here but did you know they got rid of the pretzel appetizer? It was my favorite. :( Nice setting with quality food every time I have been although this location seems to have an elderly crowd. Over the period of an hour I saw at least 40 people slowly meander in and go to the back where they have some sort of senior get together.~~#~0
Whiile waiting for my take out order it was obvious that the service is disorganized. The pulled pork sandwhich was average. Mac and cheese side was good.  Overall impression was so-so~~#~0
The food is great. The ambiance is nice.We went on a Saturday night and it was very crowded.The service could have been better. Our appetizers did not come all together. In fact one of our appetizers arrived after the entrees. (We did remind the waiters a few times but still no avail). We had to wait a long time for each of our dishes. In fact that is one of the main reasons I gave this place 3 stars.~~#~0
I really debated between a 2-star, 3-star, or 4-star.  If this based soley on their coffee drinks then they would be a 4, if based on their pastries a 3, and if based on their non-coffee drinks (ie chai, apple cider) then it would be a 2.The espresso machiattos are extremely tasty.  I usually end up leaving with quite a good buzz because I'll get a few doubles.  The customers can be kind of bothersome with their macbook pro's staring at you as you try to find a seat, but all in all, I think this place is pretty ok.~~#~0
I would rate this particular applebees a 3 only because of the good service. If it was based on my food that was placed infront of me it would definatly be rated a 1. My boyfriend and I went out to eat here last Saturday night, we got a table immediatly and our server was right there to get our drink order. He was very fast and very good. However our food was horrible. We each ordered a steak (at about $15.00 a piece) - I ordered mine medium rare and my boyfriend ordered his medium. I honestly think that those steaks were on the grill for not even five full minutes. My boyfriends steak was so so so very much rarer then mine and mine was what can you say almost raw. no where near medium or medium rare. My boyfriends mashed potatoes were eehhhh flavorless i guess you could say, and as for out mixed/seasonal vegetables- well it was just a big stalk of broccolli. I didnt really even eat and we did not dare to send our steaks back although we definatly should have, however I have worked ina restaurant and I know you do not send your steak back to be recooked. Very disappointing experience. Will not go back.~~#~0
Great little cafe in central Phoenix. Great food and adorable location! Better for lunch than dinner I think.~~#~0
Ate here today with a friend. they have all their booths occupied, so we were sat at the half booth and chair. Skinny blond server with green eyeliner served us. She was okay. Checked on us a tad bit too much, but Id rather have that than completely ignoring us. She mixed up my order though. I wanted the eggplant parmigiano but she gave me the chicken parmigiano. She quickly apologized anyway and had my right order packed To Go while i ate the mistake one. Both were good. They were meh. Not exemplary. My friend had their lasagna and she didn't finish everything, she said it was just okay too. Anyway, I'm willing to go back and try one more time. But I don't think I'll be coming back anytime sooner.~~#~0
02.06.10Like every street fest, there are vendors, vendors and more vendors out to get my money.A cop laughed at us when we posed under the "beer garden" sign.  I thought that was pretty hilarious.$4 root beer float, and you get to keep the cup.  $1 refills, for life!Chocolate and peanut covered bananas.  'Nuff said.~~#~0
You could definitely taste the rum in the ice cream!  It's a unique place to go.~~#~0
I didn't even know this place existed!In any case, naturally I ordered a burger since I gather its sports bar and all.  The Arizona burger was actually pretty good and the portions were fair.  I generally order a medium done and they hit the spot.  Love the steak fries that came along with it!  Overall food was real good.Ambience is my problem; I gathered it was for patrons of the hotel.  However, what kind of patrons; I don't know.  The place seemed outdated and very conservative.  Yawn!  Sports bar?  Did anybody catch that play on the old CRT TV screen....haha okay that was a joke, they had LCDs.  Point being it was a quiet night I attended and since our group was pretty large we sat in the "bridge" room I call it.  Since it connected to the next building.  Needless to say too quiet for my taste.However, service was good.  The food came quick and the waitress was extra careful and sensitive to our time.  Kudos!  Overall, if they can just bump it up a notch to make things more exciting this place was be fine. - Enjoy!~~#~0
Our server was awesome! Vivian was friendly, knew how to engage everyone at our table, knew the menu, and very cute (not really a criteria for excellent service, but thought I would mention it).The Blueberry Crush cocktail was good. Between the delicious adult beverage and the outdoor patio setting, life was good.I ordered the NY Strip Steak. Very tasty even if the cooks didn't get the temperature correct. No, I did not send it back to be corrected. Wish I would've tried some of the desserts. Decided to hold off and drink dessert elsewhere. Actually, they have happy hour in the lounge every day - a valid reason for coming here frequently.I would come back here again.~~#~0
I wanted to like this place a lot more.  If i could rate on "hype" it gets a 5 but after having this ice/custard concoction I cant do more than 3, in fact I would give 2 because as yelp describes, "Meh. I've experienced better."  The decor and staff is all nice, clean and friendly... I assume the staff is clean but I could be wrong about that.  I got the ice deal with custard and the custard is like frozen yogurt but thicker and not really custardy I don't know it was ok.  I would much rather go to Baskin Robbins and get one of those clown face ice cream cones I got when I was a fat kid or some flying saucers, hell I would get all of that put it in a blender pour and awesome milk shake then make some chocolate pancakes for a well balanced meal.  I gotta go....~~#~0
The bf saw a groupon for this and asked me jokingly to call in sick for a day of waterpark fun. I (being the spontaneous person I am) said "let's do it!" I am from California so I have been to my fair share of waterparks growing up. The one's in Cali are a lot bigger with a lot more rides and attractions. I must say I still had a great time coming here. We hit all the slides multiple times, and since it was in the middle of the week it wasn't too crowded. The wave pool is pretty interesting since it consists of one large wave that comes every couple of minutes, not like what I had seen at other waterparks where a number of waves comes periodically. It was also strange to me that we had to pay for rafts, I don't remember ever doing that anywhere else. I also missed my favorite "lazy river" that is at every waterpark I've been to. But other than that there is a good time to be had. I don't know if I would go back without a groupon but I recommend giving it a try especially if you have young kids.~~#~0
Cold, even for a hockey game.  And the upper deck is so steep I thought about going on belay to reach my seat!~~#~0
The husband and I decided to take the lightrail to the airport to have some dinner and people watch.  I was having a craving for the honey chipotle chicken crispers so we thought Chili's would be great.  Unfortunately they don't have a full menu at this location, which really disappointed me, but I should have expected that.  The food is typical Chili's quality, which I am always satisfied with.  Our waiter was surprisingly competent for this type of location and actually stopped by to get us soda refills and some ranch.  I did no expect that.  If you are stuck waiting around in terminal 4, and that wouldn't be surprising, Chili's is a decent choice.~~#~0
Tonight I made my first venture to Alice Cooperstown.  Why not?  I arrived at the ballpark early and wanted to fill my stomach.  I dig Alice and heard he ran a cool place.The decor was pretty cool.  I've never been to Hard Rock Cafe but I'm guessing it's similar in style.  But who goes to a restaurant for the decor?  Atmosphere adds to the experience but the food is what matters the most.I thought about trying the Big Unit dog but opted for the Gonzo's BBQ Beef sandwich w/ fries and Nightmare chili and I added the hot link for $2 more.The beef brisket was just okay.  I have much better and even for a few dollars cheaper elsewhere.  To be honest, though, I don't come to a place like this expecting the best of the best.  The hot link was standard.  The Nightmare chili really stood out.  Very tasty.  My beverage was served in a giant glass and the waitress kept the refills coming which is a major plus in my book.Overall the food was decent.  I wouldn't make a special trip down to this joint but I'd eat there again if I was already in the area for a ball game.~~#~0
Everything and the kitchen sink, just waayyy to much stuff....I get lost on what I came for. I am just not a big shopper for home stuff but I have came here to buy some christmas gifts or gifts in general. I am not a hater I would prob rate these stores higher if I was more of a shopper for these types of items. Do not avoid this location based on a 3 star review, prices are good and they sells quality items here. Visit with confidence.~~#~0
I was dying for some Mexican food. Unfortunately I am surrounded by nothing remotely yummy enough. So I get my #1 to jump in the car with me for a scavenger hunt of yumminess (yes that is a word ;) We drive up north because of a review about "life changing" tacos. Alas, we could not find the darn place even though Google maps assured me I was on top of it!!! Frustrated but not defeated we jump on the freeway and head back to the old stomping grounds (cenPho). As always we somehow manage not only to find a place, but a GREAT place!!! So upon walking in, I felt like I should be in Cali.. The psycho colors and trinkets all over are awesome.!! Now to the food. I got the mahi tacos and #1 got the steak burro. We shared the shrimp skewer and I got a marg! Kids this stuff is no joke. It's so yummy! And the prices are ridiculously low. To top off all the wonderfulness (yes it's a word also ;) of this place ( the great food. cartoonish atmosphere. Service with a smile. Salsa bar. Endless chips.... I got a free Teddy bear! Well bunny actually !!! His name is Don Julio De Cervantes (see pictures) and is quite the cutie pie!Go grab some grub. You will not be disappointed, I promise. This is one of those places where you want to try everything on the menu.Enjoy!Xoxo~~#~0
Hmmm, I think I need to return once/twice more before I see what these other reviewers have seen.  Coffee houses are difficult though because they are SOOO much alike.  House coffee?  Better than Starbucks (but not as good as mine).  I would, agree, however, that the service at Jolta Java is terrific!~~#~0
when i was 11 my mother taught me how to use an Abacus. i felt like i was given "ancient chinese secret". which is odd, because how the hell did my mother get an ancient chinese secret. she was a white woman from Rhode Island..but anyways..i was all into this thing..doing my homework, keeping track of how much money my friends owed me, took it with me when i was buying groceries at the store.sadly, i got out of practice...now i look at the damn thing like every other american and wonder. wtf it is that thing.Lunch Specials are affordable, food is pretty good. nothing all that special. it's just  a catch all american-chinese food place. if you in the area and are looking for lunch options give it a try. if you are looking for great asian food, give it a pass. i think i paid 7.50 for lunch. 10 with tip.~~#~0
Yesterday afternoon I dragged one of my friends along with me to check this place out.  After reading Mr. K's review down below, I'd have to say nothing has really changed because I had generally the same experience.  No one wants to read the same review twice so I will keep it short.  A few things:-The rice was sprinkled with cinnamon.  I've never experienced such a thing and didn't enjoy it.-The decor is ridiculously tacky.-The credit card machine was not working, and he didn't mention this to us, so we had to run across the way to QT to get some cash.  He didn't seem very worried that we would not return, and was apologetic so I wasn't really mad.  It was a pretty hilarious situation.  When we both came back with $20's, he was afraid he didn't have the change for us.  If you are wanting something a little different and in the West Valley (and not in a huge hurry), you should check this spot out.  It appears as if it is a one-man run business and Yelpers seem to love the mom and pops, so check it out!  Bring cash just in case!~~#~0
Food:  Good to OKService: Good to OKOysters; YummyLike Dottsy Z., I haven't been blown away by anything, and I've tried probably a third of the menu.  Everything has been at least "good". but considering the prices, I'm on the edge as to how enthusiastically to recommend the place.  Service has always been courteous, which goes a long way with me, but a few times the waits have been oddly long at times that weren't busy.The French onion soup is a hit for me, although I'd like slightly less brioche.  Served in a mini-tureen, the gruyere is baked perfectly, overflowing the sides in crispy yumminess.  The pate plate is interesting, but much to my disappointment it's not a liver pate.  The frites are almost British style - hot soft and limp, fabulous if you like that style, which I do.  The outdoor patio is lovely, but can be crammed with tourists toting mewling babies and screaming tots when the weather is nice.~~#~0
Average Target.~~#~0
OK, so we went back tonight for dinner.. I have to say, I was pretty peeved that they raised their prices.  So, now when I ordered just ONE shrimp taco, it came out to 4.90 with tax and all - are you flippin' kidding me!?!?!  It's about 5 shrimp, chipotle cream salsa, red cabbage, and corn tortilla for FIVE DOLLARS.  No way... I mean, they're pretty damn good tacos for being hundreds of miles away from the shore, but 5 dollars for ONE taco?  That's a bit presumptuous. Like I said before, I'm not expecting .99c value meal prices.. but I'm also not paying Scottsdale prices for a taco.~~#~0
Great quick bfast bite. I was staying across the street and I just wanted a quick lite bite before hitting the pool and this was a winner. Practically in hotel dining.We had the french toast which is more like a casserole and a scramble.~~#~0
Okay, this should be 3.5 stars - but I rounded down because of the price uppings on the menu...which I understand - but the duct tape was a bit tacky. They could have at least gone with some masking tape. :)Food was good. I even branched out from my normal 'Bertos ordering of the carnitas plate ("It just happens to be my favorite, and I order it ... in every dive I go to in this country"...name that actor that I'm paraphrasing).I didn't branch out too much - went carnitas taco and 3rolled tacos with guac. Guac was good, a bit less chunky thatn I prefer, but not bad. Coulda been spiced up a bit...I suspect its more of an avocado puree than a true guac. Carnitas had good shells (2 soft/warm corn, like it should). Nice crust on the meat. Really seared it well. Can't remember what GF had...shredded beef tacos I'd bet. That's her 'Berto's go-to. All in all, not bad. If anyone can explain that wooden structure hanging below the drop ceiling for no apparent reason, I'd like to hear what your theory on it is. We'd stop in again, but there's a few other 'Berto's just as close (or closer) that we'd probably hit up first.~~#~0
I love the location and the food. The service is bad, it's like you should be grateful to buy their food if they are busy. Which they are in winter. The mocha's are great when done correctly. Is it worth a trip. YES. It is very European in the sense no customer service. I try hard not to give a bad review but whomever is training them probably is a family member.You don't know if you should pay first for the Ice cream or get in line because they change it depending on who is working. Hopefully they will figure it out because I love the food and I enjoy it there so I would go but be patient.~~#~0
I will only add to the many reviews saying that the service here is pretty terrible, but the food is pretty good.  But I will add that I went to the Pita Jungle location in Scottsdale and received better service.  Still not great, but better.Their falafel plate is great, the honey pasta salad is good but easily made at home, and their hummus is reliable but again, I could make this at home and not be ignored by indifferent servers as I wait 20 minutes for my check.~~#~0
Four of us stopped here for a late lunch on 3/19. We were all starving and our first choice, Zinburger in the same shopping mall, was closed for some reason. For a second choice, True Food was pretty good. It's like all the Fox Restaurants I've been to - open kitchen concept, young staff, loud music with a modern-industrial feel. The first thing the waiter told us while handing us menus was that one of the restaurant co-owners is Dr. Andrew Weil. He went on to explain how healthy and organic their menu selections are. Apparently this is their standard opening line to every customer since I heard it mentioned to other diners around us. My daughter and I had the raw fish special which was served sliced sashimi-style topped with a sesame-miso sauce alongside thinly shredded carrots and cukes. It was very good with an appetizing presentation. I had the wild ahi sliders. The waiter warns that it's cooked raw. It came with sweet potato hash. The sliders were delicious, slightly warm and very flavorful. The sweet potato hash was tough and cold and had probably been sitting around for too long. The shrimp dumplings appetizer (you get 6) were also very tasty as was the chicken pizza that our guests had. Hubby decided to go vegetarian and had the Miso Soup and Vegetable Caeser Salad, both of which were filling enough for him. They also have specialty drinks that weren't really worth the cost. Hubby's Cucumber Refresher was pretty tasteless and my Green Arnie was weak. The atmosphere was loud and energetic. The kitchen is right there and they don't care if they're banging pots, pans and dishes everywhere. We were there at the end of the busy lunch hour when the restaurant had emptied out and it was still pretty loud. Service was quick. Our food arrived within 15 minutes of ordering them and they all arrived at the same time. Our waiter was helpful and friendly and he did check on us a couple of times but took care not to hover. It's a good place to eat if you want "healthy" choices and don't want to think too hard about it. I don't know that I'd come back here again, especially if Zinburber was open!~~#~0
Corbin's is only OK. They can get overwhelmed quickly which leads to poor service. Their steaks are all right, nothing special. Their famous quesadillas are really more of a crisp. They taste great, but at $10 for a crisp, it's kind of a rip-off!The good thing about this place is that they have a lot of craft beers on tap as well as interesting drinks. Corbin's is a great place to have some drinks, watch a little football, and have an appetizer. Not really a place to go for dinner~~#~0
We really, really wanted to like this more and PLEASE someone correct me if I'm wrong. The food just tasted a little off. My partner and I have eaten a lot of Greek food, we love it. When we lived in Chicago, Greektown was one of our favorite places to have dinner. So, why does the food at Saba's taste so...different?The Avgolemeno Soup was good as was the service. We just weren't jumping for joy over the food. I had the Chicken Sultani and my partner had the Chicken Gyros Platter. Both were just okay and it really came down to the seasonings they used. They just seemed to be too pungent or aromatic.We might try Saba's again, but for something more mainstream like Gyros.~~#~0
I'm actually trying to decide if I want to give this review. This is a little known dmv.  I always get in and out in ridiculous timing. For that, I love this local secret.  But in the end, it's still a government facility with disgruntled government workers. Not exactly a great experience.~~#~0
This is one of the most overrated restaurants in town.  People rave about it - then you find out they know nothing about food.  The noise levels in the restaurant are deafening. The food is fine, but nothing special.  The wine list is ridiculously long.  Ask for help w/ the wine list and you'll quickly be directed to some overpriced wines.~~#~0
Decent Thai-ish place in Old Town. This place gets packed at night, so get a reservation if you plan on eating after 7 pm. I really liked the Burmai gao and duck shumai.  The jalapeño fried rice was a bit of a miss, but the chicken in it was very tender and kind of carried the dish. We had a stir fry seafood dish with squid, which was a little chewy and tasteless. I'd say stick with the stuff that doesn't include seafood, especially based on the previous review about poopy shrimp.~~#~0
My husband and I came in on New Years eve afternoon. The young man Aaron cooked us wonderful burgers however he was doing everything all by himself the so called manager appeared to be waisted and had very poor hygene. We felt sorry for Aaron this Manager couldn't remember our order or our drinks. Other customers were telling us good luck with him.when Aaron did make my shake the Manager had to be told by another customer my shake was melting. We would return if you get a new manager he made our first visit unappealing I wouldn't want him touching my food he looked dirty and drunk!! The stars are for the food and  Aaron.~~#~0
We came here with the local recommendation of our hotel concierge. Good place to get tequila with delicious tacos, he said. We came during lunch on Saturday so no happy hour and no drinks to vouch for. We ordered the Pollo Asada Burrito and Tres Tacos combo. The burrito was good, not spectacular in the marinade. They kinda went light on the cheese and guac, but the black beans were delicious. For the tacos- we ordered Lobster, Mahi mahi, and shrimp. The shrimp tacos were my favorite. Extremely flavorful, and cooked perfectly. This place can add a little more lobster to the taco, and the mahi mahi was okay.The service was quick and all the ladies were very nice. Food was mediocre though.~~#~0
Very nice office and friendly staff.  Dr. Ferrall was also very friendly and knowledgeable.  After reading the previous Yelp reviews on his other listing (http://www.yelp.com/biz/aztmj-scottsdale) I was sure to ask them how much my insurance company was going to cover and how much I would have to pay out of pocket.  My total for the initial office consultation and scan thing came to $120 which was the exact amount they told me it would be when I asked over the phone.  If they were wrong about my insurance and send me a bill I will update this review.The only downside is that they refuse to do anything more for you at the initial consultation if you don't agree to injections or put down a ton of money for a dental appliance.  If you are in pain they refuse to give you a prescription for muscle relaxants or an anti-inflammatory medication.Another thing that put me off was that if you are hesitant to plop down $500 on the spot for the dental appliance, they try to negotiate the down payment like a car dealer and even offer you interest free financing.I'm going to get a second opinion from a dentist to see if Dr. Ferrall's treatment plan is legit and worth $900 out of my pocket.~~#~0
Had 6:30 reservations for A Saturday night and arrived at that time.  We were told there would be a wait.  Grrrrrr!  After waiting for several minutes, we were told a table would be ready in minutes.  Oops, sorry there is another party ahead of you.  Grrrrrr!After complaining, we were finally seated.  The waitress came over and put 2 bread plates on the table.  Since the appetizers were uninteresting, we ordered a couple of beers.  Several minutes later she came by and said the bar was backed up and she would go check.  In the meantime, she came back for our dinner order.  We both ordered different schnitzels.  Finally beer came, along with the soup.  Grrrrrr!After a couple spoonfuls of soup, here comes the entrees.  Timing and service was terrible.  Food was average.  Never figured out what the bread plates were for.  I had also advised the waitress it was my son's birthday thinking she would send the Oompah Band by, but no.  This was the downer of our otherwise wonderful trip to AZ for Rangers Spring Training....~~#~0
I really wanted to like this place, because the decor was okay, there was ample space/lighting, the employees were really nice, and they had a separate vegan menu, but it fell short of expectations. The iced soy latte was probably the most bitter espresso drink I have ever had in my life, and the vegan breakfast burrito tasted like I was consuming solid air (aka, like nothing). The sweet potato hash was okay, but not enough to save the meal. My boyfriend had the mushroom/spinach vegan scramble and it had a really weird, stale taste. It cost us $24 for two people, which isn't cheap for what you get. Perhaps the non-vegan entrees are better, but if you're looking for vegetarian or vegan options, maybe try your luck elsewhere. But nothing against the place itself because they had great service and were genuinely friendly!~~#~0
We stayed here for 2 nights and were happy with our stay.  The room was clean, in my experience the staff was friendly and the air conditioning worked very well, keeping us cool in the triple digit heat.  Microwave and mini fridge in room was nice.  There is a pool, we didn't go in but it looked clean.  My only real complaint is the bed was hard and not the most comfortable thing I've ever slept on.  The breakfast was cereal, heat and serve pancakes, scrambled eggs, toast, juice and coffee.  Overall I would stay here again when in the area.~~#~0
LIKE:- Friendly, personable *customers* - Friendly, personable *staff*- Best place to find Mojo back-issue CD comps.- Good local music selectionDON'T LIKE:- Unbelievably crowded parking lot. Really sucks. :(- No paper zines (Hoozdoo doesn't count.) And it's next to a bookstore.- No Cocteau Twins, no This Mortal Coil, no 80's-era 4AD.- No Syd Barrett-era Pink Floyd. All of which has been reissued.~~#~0
Today, Papa's was offering a large cheese pizza (with up to 8 additional toppings for free) to acknowledge the Arizona Cardinals 4 touch downs and win in yesterdays game.  What a great deal!!  We placed an order on-line several hours ahead of time for a 5:30 pick up at this store.  I arrive to get the pie and it did look wonderful as they always do, however my request for a square cut was not done.  The cashier graciously asked if I wanted to have another pizza pie made but I declined as there was not enough time in my evening schedule.  When it arrived a the house, it was still hot and everyone enjoyed it as always.  They really do make one of the better pizza's, two very enthusiastic thumbs-up for the taste and value ratings.  My overall rating for this store is only 3 stars as their on-line system has made mistakes in the past and this was no exception.  It has already been addressed with the corporate offices and I am certain it will be addressed and corrected. Bottom line:  Great Pizza...great price, locations everywhere.  Take advantage of their specials as they cannot be beat!! Be cautious of the on-line ordering. ENJOY!!~~#~0
So, my mom was in town and I needed a place with coffee, a conscience, and wireless.  Bunna, basedon on Bonnie's review, seemed to be a good match.  It also isn't far from Wildflower (a mom-fav).  So we marched on down there with laptops, I made her proofread my personal essay for a felloweship application, and we munched on scones and drank our drinks.  The coffee surpassed my test:  it did not suck and it did not upset by digestive system (as Starbucks is wont to do).  The place was chill, the barista (who I think is also the owner) pretty much knew everyone there (except us first timers).  It was cheery and not so hipster-y as to scare away my mom. and they weren't irritated that we sat there for sooo sooooooooo long.  I might make this one of my Saturday spots when I have to do work but  don't really want to but really need to.  Why three stars?  I kind of wished they had a lunch menu.~~#~0
Yes it's true, it's worth all 5 stars. A quaint little place out of a home renovated into a restaurant. Every server greeted us, asked about us like we were old pals, just wonderful wonderful customer service from the moment we walked in, to the time we left. We had an order of the traditional fresh spring roll which was delicious and fresh, however I do wish they would serve more than just one that's been cut in half. We ordered a lychijito and mango fizz drink which were ehh...okay at best. But We had ordered the spicy shrimp (I forget the actual name of the appetizer), which I could eat all freaking day omg!!! Unfortunately they were out of the pork when we wanted to order the crispy spring roll which was a bummer, but the spicy shrimp was an excellent dish that we forgot all about it. However, if you have a low tolerance for spice, this is not a dish for you cuz it is spiiiccyyyy. Lucky for me, I love spicy foods. Then onto the pho dish itself, now I've had many a bowl of pho, and I'll say it's one of the best bowls of pho ive had. You can literally taste the difference between this $10 bowl vs. your $4.50 pho at a grumpy Vietnamese noodle house who just stare you down as you sit down, and stare at you when you say thank you when served your food. The beef tastes much cleaner, and more delicate. The broth is a good beefy broth that has not been watered down, and even the noodles are of better quality. Yum! Yum! If you're going somewhere else for pho, DON'T!Came back a 2nd time, not so blown away maybe it was the service the first time that was so awesome but ehh not so much the 2nd. The egg roll has NO flavor and for some reason the Pho here was just not as up to par the first time around. Not to mention it is twice the price as a regular Pho place we just end up eating at Pho thanh on 19th ave and camelback instead.~~#~0
3-Stars only for FnB???  Relax..  This is just a courtesy heads-up for the fellow Yelpers.  I don't think another review is needed for FnB.  And plus, I didn't eat there.I'm a big fan of saddling up to the bar for a drink at restaurants.  I was walking around old town the other night and walked by FnB, glanced in, and decided to do just that.  Oops.  So you know, what you see in there that looks like a bar to sit at is not a bar to sit at.  Instead of drinks being made behind what was the bar before FnB, is now where all the cooking takes place, so there is no "bar" to casually sit at.  Just letting you know that the spots at the bar are reserved seating.I only give it 3 stars because I didn't eat, so I can't judge the food.  However, the food looked awesome.When I walked in and told the guy at the door I was just going to "grab a seat at the bar for a drink", he explained to me that it was all seating and they were booked full.  I initially thought he was joking, but then that's when I realized that isn't a bar, it's seating around the kitchen.  I mean, you're literally 4 feet away from the gals (and one guy), cooking.  I looked and said, "oh.......".  And just stared at this little space.  He was cool though, he said, "hey, how long you gonna be?"  I said, "seriously, about 20 minutes".  He got me a seat at the "bar" where I had a glass of wine, watched the food being made and served and got a general feel for the place.  Just know that you can't step in for a quick drink.  But I appreciate him being accommodating.I plan on going back and trying the food.~~#~0
My husband and I were pretty underwhelmed with our experience at Lola on Saturday night (note: do not go on the night of the APS light parade...it makes getting to Lola near impossible). We really really wanted to like it, but the whole experience just came up flat for us.The intimacy and decor of Lola is great; it's not big enough where it will get very loud and the whole long tables to allow for community dining is nice. The color palatte was soothing and did not distract from the main focus which is the food. We were with a group of nine that evening, and from our perspective (not sure how our fellow diners felt), I thought service was spotty. Sometimes we would have to ask three times for something and it wasn't very crowded most of the time we were there. It was just like the waitress forgot. Apparently before we arrived, our group had ordered the olives which never materalized at the table; luckily we were not charged for them. Also, I really don't appreciate when waiters and waitresses cop a small attitude when you order a soda and not an alcoholic beverage. I know it's crazy, but even I don't want beer or wine with every meal!I thought the food was the most disappointing part of the whole evening. The menu is pretty small, which surprises me for a tapas restaurant. Isn't the whole idea variety? Also, some of the dishes were good to share among four people, and others we had to really ration out the portions so that everyone who wanted a bite could have one. We also had to order four plates of the special since it was so popular with our table and to ensure everyone got at least one whole piece. I liked the tortilla espanola, but the one at Sol y Sombra is much better (and larger!). The special was also very good, but seriously how can  you go wrong with toasted baguette, goat cheese and onions? My husband tried the gambas (he likes the shrimp dish at Caffe Boa better), the steak and the pork and he said they were nothing special and were very unmemorable. My last complaint about the food is that there was no chicken dish at all on the menu!!! I'll admit I can be kinda of a picky eater, but even my husband commented on the lack of a chicken option for non-red meat or seafood eaters.My husband and I decided that we enjoy Sol y Sombra much more and do not see ourselves making a special trip back to Lola in the near future.~~#~0
I finally got around to booking an appointment at Maiya's Nails; I learned that it's best to do so after being denied twice without having an appointment. Save yourself the disappointment and call 15 minutes ahead to see what's available.  I walked in and was immediately greeted, and nail tech hurried over and told me to come sit. Yikes!  Hardly time to pick out a color!  There was no nonsensical chit-chat or gossip and my toes were perfectly polished within 30 minutes.  I felt a bit rushed through the entire service--my feet could've used more scrubbing with the pumice stone, and the massage would have been better if she took her time.  I noticed the nail tech glance at her watch a few times too.   I did not see an autoclave machine to properly sterilize the tools.  I noticed the nail tech cleaning her tools with a cotton ball and rubbing alcohol as I approached the pedi chair.  She swiftly placed them in a plastic box...I couldn't help but think of all the germs lurking inside...ew. It's a nice place to get a quality pedicure in a speedy fashion, but I'm still looking for my "go-to" nail salon.~~#~0
I don't know what it is about Chipotle I've just never liked it.  The food is good, average to me.  The staff is always friendly which is always a plus.  I don't know if its the decor and/or food.  Who picked the most uncomfortable seating?  And it's in every location.  I really have nothing further to add.~~#~0
Given that I went to the Downtown Phoenix Public Market without any caffeination whatsoever, I was in a pretty gnarled state by the end of my tomato buying excursion. I wanted to sit and cool down somewhere and have some coffee. I immediately thought of all my regular coffee joints, but since I was already in this neck of the woods, I thought I'd check to see if Fair Trade was open.Now, it's not the first time I've attempted to go to Fair Trade. I've tried several times before on weekends, and they've always been closed. And I'd forget their hours and then try again and...still closed.But today? Open! So for all you people, at least at noon on Saturdays, this joint's doors are unlocked. I walked in and surveyed the scene. I definitely got a Berkeley earth mother vibe, which I didn't really expect to get in downtown Phoenix, but this town never ceases to surprise me one way or the other. I can't remember all the stuff they had to offer for sale besides their coffee products, but I do remember it appealing much to yogacentric ladies (not that there's anything wrong with that).Ok, survey over, I still needed caffeine. I looked at their menu. The sizes for their coffee drinks: large, grande, venti. Are you kidding me? Why would a coffeehouse, called Fair Trade Cafe of all things, choose to label its cup sizes after Starbucks?  Beats me."I'd like a small hot coffee and a large iced chai. And I want the chai with soy, if you can make it.""Sure, no prob."Now I know it sounds bizzarre to you, but I needed the hot coffee to wake me up (iced coffee does nothing). But then I wanted something to cool me down. Plus I saw people drinking iced chai at the farmers market and it looked good. And I never drink chai at coffeehouses, hot or iced, so I thought why not today?I then sat down with my two drinks on the couch and read the NY Times. In a relaxed state. And tasted my drinks.I'd say the coffee was good, but the iced soy chai was excellent. I kept switching back between sips of each. I guess I'm weird. Or maybe I was just hot from walking around in 100 degrees for an hour. Who knows.I sat there for a while reading, and I noticed out of 9 patrons there I was the only guy in the entire joint, so maybe it is an earth mother establishment after all. No Sarah Maclachlan on the soundsystem, though. Actually, no music at all. I know that there's no rule governing coffeehouses and whether they should have music (either live or on the stereo) on at all times, but it did seem a little silent, apart from the quiet chattering at the other tables.I'd say all in all Fair Trade is a good place in a great location and uses best practices to obtain quality coffee (including Pura Vida Coffee and Just Coffee, which comes from a co-op of 50 families in Chiapas, Mexico), but man, if they were only open throughout the weekends and into the evenings, downtown would definitely benefit. I'm not sure if the adjacent Trinity Episcopal Cathedral actually owns the cafe or not, but I didn't get any religious vibe from the joint while I was there.So, 3 stars for now. Maybe I'll bump up the star wattage in the future. Whenever I find them open again, that is.~~#~0
For the last several summers, Gayle, my son and I have made our annual trip to the Heartland. We fly into Des Moines and the combination of convenient flights at a decent price is sometimes limited. Past choices featured United through Denver and Northwest through the Twin Cities. Delta through Salt Lake City is also available, but Gayle doesn't like the air turbulence that sometimes comes with using that airport. This year's winner was US Airways through Phoenix. US Airways was a 2 Star flying experience flying out and a better 3 Star trip coming back. All 4 flights were on time and the attendants did a good job of making the trip bearable, considering the tight quarters and the cattle car aspects of modern air travel currently practiced by many airlines. Interestingly enough, the original cattle car airline (Southwest) is the one I currently enjoy best for clean airplanes, on time performance, and a service model that has never wavered. Before arriving at Sky Harbor Airport from Oakland, our connecting gate to Des Moines was announced. This information matched what was printed on our ticket and what was displayed on the TV Monitor. And after the maximum walk from one side of the terminal to the other, we arrived at our gate and settled in. After awhile I got the sense that something wasn't right and asked the gate agent about the flight. She informed me that the gate had changed and that we better "hurry" or we'd miss our flight. When I asked about any previous announcement, she curtly informed me that this was my problem, not US Airways! Then when we finally got on our plane, the attendant announced that there was a problem with the toilets and that we would have to "self flush" if we needed to use them during our flight. We all thought it was a joke until a few minutes later, we watched the attendant carry several water bottles back to the bathroom. I don't think there was a single trip to the back by anyone on the plane during the entire trip!~~#~0
The key thing about pizza from this place is your choice of crust.  The thin crust pizza is actually pretty good.  Not great, but good.  It won't rank up there with Grazie or anything like that, but the sauce is respectable and the crust is nice.  However, as another review wrote, it is a bit chewy.The pizza with "regular" crust is only so-so (meh).  Kids like it, so we pick some up with regularity, but it's nothing special.On the plus side, they do have a 14-inch $5 large (regular crust) pizza.  I don't think I've seen pizza priced that cheaply since college.  The place is family-owned, so we support it when the kids are in the mood for pizza.If you want a cheap pie to couple with some cold beverages, the this place is a good bet.  But if you want great pizza, there are better options out there.~~#~0
I really like their thin crust pizzas. Parking at this location can be a pain.~~#~0
Don't get me wrong, this place is tasty, but goodness sakes, did I seriously just pay that much for a hot dog that tastes like the $1.50 ones at Costco down the way?~~#~0
If I have to choose a bar on Mill Ave. to goto, I goto Rula Bula. They've got a good selection of beer, food, and plenty of space to chill. I can look past the $2 weekend cover, because I guess compaired to some of the 10-25 dollar covers I've experienced while living in AZ, this ain't so bad.  Sometimes (forgot which days) they have nice live music here. There's a couple that comes in and one of them plays the fiddle really well (They have other non-irish performers as well). I still say they should get somekind of Irish/Celtic jukebox that continiously plays Irish drinking songs or something. I mean, it would be a big improvement on the random mix of hip-hop/techno they do play (when their radio is actually working). I guess asking for more Irish music in an "Irish pub" is pretty silly of me.~~#~0
Ambience was fine even though we sat on the deck outside. The sweet potato fries are "the bomb.com" and the sliders were just "eh".  Service was great the waiter was very prompt with acknowledging when new people came to the table and assisting them with finding seats. Overall it was just ok, probably not the first place i would consider going for happy hour but its not bad.~~#~0
I give them three stars for being within walking distance, and having a pretty good happy hour food menu.I wouldn't consider trying anything exotic hereHowever, for 2$ salmon nigiri, Ra does a good enough job.The drinks are still pretty expensive, even during happy hourThe crowd is full of d-bags, but I usually just ignore them and sit on the patio in my own happy little world :)~~#~0
My better half suggested I eat here when I visited Phoenix. I think he likes it so much because he has memories here.The food was ok. The cheese crisp is really good. The best part of Rosita's was the prickly pear margaritas.~~#~0
Film bar is a great concept but the uncomfortable seating knocks it down a few stars. I have been here a few times just to grab a drink and it is always dark and usually dead. When there is a show going on the place lights up and the bartenders seem to get overwhelmed with the crowd. Service seems to be particularly slow when you are in a hurry to take your seats for a show. There are also no signs or helpful employees to tell you where to pick up your will call tickets. We walked around a bit lost before we finally figured it out. I went to see Scandalesque and they over sold the show and I had to sit on a pillow on the floor. I didn't get too upset, but after paying $20 for a ticket I at least expected a seat. Thank goodness I was wearing pants. Had I not been, the women on stage wouldn't have been the only ones showing off their panties.Good concept but it needs some work.~~#~0
Let me just say, in general I love Subway, always have. Used to work at one as a matter of fact, during my college days back in Austin - the one on the corner of 29th and Guadalupe next to Toy Joy, the best Subway EVER. The problem with Subway is the lack of consistency from store to store. The good ones can be really, really good - super fresh veggies, generous helpings, clean inside...  and the bad ones can be just as bad. Well, this one - the one in the Fry's shopping center on the southeast corner of Ray and Rural, is somewhere in the middle. Can't really rave or complain about any of those things.What did bug me about this particular location were a couple of the employees who insisted on giving me a hard time for not eating meat - especially when I ordered the veggie patty. They made faces when pulling it out of the wrapper, ask me what was in it, get grossed out when I told 'em... and then pretty much challenge my quasi-vegetarian views, which wasn't really why I was there, you know? I just wanted my damn sandwich, no questions asked. Now, that being said, I do have to give them credit for even having the veggie patty on their menu in the first place, as not all Subways across the valley are considerate enough to do so...~~#~0
LOCATION: Not in a shopping center for once! Stand alone grocer.PRODUCT: What irks me about this place is that EVERYTHING even the produce is pre-packaged in plastic bags in set portions. What a waste of plastic bags. OMG. Can't they just put out the produce like every other normal grocery store? Not impressed with this place in terms of quality and price and definitely not on the list of grocery stores on my usual grocery store route. PERKS: You will find good deals in the discount section but you have to go in the morning to get the good stuff. Good sandwiches, pasta dishes, fruits, veggies, meats to grill that day. Awesome deals actually and good quality. They even had fresh figs one time!PARKING: No issues in the grocer parking lot. CONCLUSION:  Good to stop by once in a while to check out their discount section for excellent stuff but other than that nothing spectacular compared to other grocers in the area.~~#~0
I hit this place up in hour 2 of my 5 hour wait for my flight and ordered the quesadilla.  Came with nacho chips, salsa, guac, and sour cream.  Everything was GOOD.  My final bill was under 10 bucks (I didn't get a beer or anything) and I left very satisfied.Perhaps my favorite part of the establishment was the staff.  The bartender was very nice and outgoing.  We talked sports and stuff.  He's probably used to making small talk with all sorts of weary travelers.  Anyways, it was appreciated.~~#~0
I have been selling these guys my old CDs and DVDs... you don't get much back but it is better than nothing.~~#~0
I have been shopping at this Fry's as well as another  one off of Shea and 92nd St for over 10 years now. I have to say the Fry's on Indian School is way over due for an internal remodel  of the  whole store. The bathrooms are not ones to use unless you do not mind using a dirty, very lightly cleaned bathroom. The produce is  overpriced compared to Sunflower's that is right up the road and less than 1/2 mile. The customer service desk staff has always been a bit grouchy or rude but I go to purchase money orders and they are 50 cents a piece so I go to  Fry's rather than my bank for these. They have some staff that has worked there for years and is friendly to customers. You can run into weirdo's there like one other poster I noticed exclaimed but you will run into some crazy people just about anywhere nowadays.~~#~0
I recently had the chance to go back to Old Pueblo Cafe and found that its a bit more industrial than original.  On this visit, my dining partner had a fish enchilada with rice and beans.  It had the appearance of being hand assembled and she claimed it to be quite tasty.  The beans were good and assisted in making the rice a whole lot better when mixed together.  My meal was that of a Green Chili Beef Chimichanga.  The same rice and beans were served and they were palatable when mixed together but the Chimi seemed like something that was taken from a frozen food locker and warmed up to be served.  There was nothing fresh made or original about it.  Yes, the filling was flavorful but the presentation and appearance looked pre-packaged and not fresh made.  This is a huge issue for me as Mexican food is very cost effective as well as simple to make in any kitchen.  The pricing is a bit high as well, especially for food that is pre-made and just warmed up.  Maybe the rent is high in Litchfield but not enough to pay almost $11 for a frozen Chimichanga.  Cocktails....we both had the house Margarita and while it was tasty, I think $5.95 for a non-call-alcohol made drink at happy hour is a bit much.  The size was OK but the overall quality for the value is still not there. Yes, I will go back on occasion as I am local and its about 200 yards from the house but if I am looking for authentic Mexican food, its time to look elsewhere.~~#~0
Service was slow, but the staff is knowledgeable.~~#~0
I worked in the same plaza as the one on Mill and used to frequent it for lunch (and enjoyed it) so when I discovered they opened one up close by, I was stoked.My ''go to'' at the Tempe location had always been the Pollo Fundido...not ''authentic'' mexican food by any standard, but it was always a chickeny, cheesy, gooey flavor bonanza that I enjoyed thoroughly.  Feeling nostalgic, I went ahead and ordered one.  Renata K mentioned that the chicken was ''watery''...she was right.  I  cut the guy in half and a bunch of liquid came pouring out.  Of course that immediately turned me off because not only was it gross in general, it started sogging up my Fundito (it's deep fried...basically a chimi)  That watery chicken had no flavor at all...basically a very tasty shell with very tasy Fundido sauce filled with chicken textured nothingness.Might have been an off day...since I've had the Rod Burro and the green chili burro and they have been good...afraid to order the Pollo Fundido again but a friend did once while we were there and looked like the same issue (he's not picky AT ALL so he said it was good).2 things that I always liked a lot at Someburros: the rice and the hot sauce, were both still awesome at this location...just won't be ordering my ''go to'' there....sadly.~~#~0
Overpriced for what it is. The atmosphere is great, which is why it still gets three stars. The food is so-so at best.~~#~0
Happy hour sausagefest apres 6 pm weekdays. There must have been 30 guys and maybe 5 chicks on two different occasions. Whoa! I like the specials and love the Malibu accessories spread across the walls. Way to get my attention!!~~#~0
Not the best taqureria.I prefer amados late night or Rivas.but its close to my house after a late painting session or working in the garage,if you order simple you,ll be fine,preferably if you have a maxi can buddy to order for you,you probably wont get the squirts,haha~~#~0
I'm not exactly a fan of thin crust, but I gotta admit, Oreganos crust is pretty tasty... this coming from a pan/deep dish loving girl! It's probably because of their inventive toppings. My favorite is the El Picasso... Crisp tortilla chip topped pizza? I AM THERE!I also like to eat there wing and salad style, split with a friend: Mrs. G's Spinach Salad and Italian Gold Wings, the latter is thanks to a friend and fellow wing-lover of mine who moved away. As it is made with mustard--I hate mustard--I would've never thought to order it, but she told me they were her fave and we had a wing night and I agreed! I've even made a noodle dish with the sauce--it is THAT good! My fave prior were the Wong's Wings, but alas, they have since deleted it off their menu. I can heartily say, even if they were still on the menu, the Italian Golds still win the Gold!Another thing I miss off their menu are the waffle fries. They recently changed their fry option to Bistro sweet po's... but couldn't they have both? I know Sweet potatoes are better for you, but I LOVED the crispness of their waffle fries paired with an order of wings to share. Now I have to go to Ticoz for the Crisp Waffle Fry fix--the only alternative is Chick Fil-A... but theirs are mushier.And as the sweet ending? The Triple Vanilla Scooped Chocolate Chip Pizza Cookie, of course!I've had other things off the menu through the years... The Frisco, Pesto Pizza, Original Salad with that Raspberry Dressing... but they are just okay.My only complaint is the wait... when this place gets busy, it gets SO busy--Even for to go orders! I had an experience once where it was a 45 minute wait to eat there and a 1.5 hour wait for a to go order... WHAT?! And even when dining... the wait is pretty long... but I don't notice because I'm usually enjoying the company I'm with... so, if you bring great friends and lots of time, you will be fine!~~#~0
Stopped here for a beer Sunday evening, and while this place has an impressive list of interesting beers, I couldn't get past how depressed or hungover the staff seemed.  Maybe their questionable decision-making was leading to their lack of any interest in what was going on.  Who knows, chalk it up to a case of the Sunday nights.  I'll go back.  I hope everyone is in a better mood.~~#~0
Jimmy John's convenience appeals to my geeky tech side. Hellman's Mayo, jalapeno and bbq chips, pickles, bread and cold cuts tickle my taste buds.Whether its walk in location or at-your-discretion gratuity/delivery charge, Jimmy John's convenience can't be beat.--iPhone app--Website--online account lets me save my credit cards, delivery addresses and phone numbers, and i can even name and customize my favorite sandwichesMy favorite is #9, extra onion, light mayo, extra sprouts, plus cucumber.Jimmy John's is my quick fix for a great sandwich, NOW.~~#~0
3.5, rounded down.I come here a lot, and I always admire the beautifully arranged selection of jewelry, sniff the yummy candles, and lust for the clothes, but can't really afford anything.  Ever.  Even during the 50% off summer sale.Except the letterpress cards, which are always clever and lovely and original.  And, oh yes, quite affordable.~~#~0
Meh. Its good. I have been here before...its just not the best. I had a bad craving for a falafel sandwich, only pita jungle is a bit more of a drive from my work. So I called up Saba's and placed a pick up order. When I got there, I was promptly ignored and not greeted even though there were 2 people behind the cash register. The old man grunted at me and pointed at the order I just watched him bag up (I had placed an order for 4 people, nothing crazy by any measure) I asked if I could give him half cash and the rest on my card...I get another grunt (more of a disapproving grunt), this clearly put him in a bad mood. I said thank you I don't know how many times, but that wasn't enough. When i got back to work I was a bit disappointed. I ordered a side salad with my falafel and the house dressing was some really weird dressing I have never had, though the lettuce was very fresh and crisp...My falafel its self was ok. The patties were good, the pita bread got super soggy really fast and I was sad to see no onions or cucumber or hummus in it like pita jungle does. If my co workers wanted to go here again, I would most likely order something else and give it another try, but wouldn't suggest it if it was up to me.~~#~0
I actually really like this place. The portions are not small compared to the price and size of gelato spot. For 1.85 you gt the same amount that you would at g spot for 3.80. I had them dig out the base that they use for the fro yo. Surprisingly it is not that scary , natural for the most part the only thing I saw that was bad was corn sweetener. They ones with name brand candy bars in them have trans fat because the candy bars do. I would be weary of the peanut butter one too because most peanut butter contains partially hydrogenated oils. Almost all the toppings have it too. Thats why I prefer Sweet Republic as all there toppings are homemade. But if you want cheap ? I like the mango rasberry twist.~~#~0
Customer service here is really friendly and the fact that this place is always packed and caters to the Sun City crowd and snow birds really isn't Costco's fault, but it really makes shopping here a real pain in the ass. I have been to this Costco more times than I want to fess up to, and the last time I was in Arizona (the beginning of January), I had the "pleasure" in a 3 day trip of coming here twice.  Once with my mother and once to escort my 87 year old Grandma. The upside:Super nice employees-much more patient than I would be given the clientele. Optometry cleaned my Grandmother's glasses without a fuss.They sell Hebrew National salami, something we can't get up here.Electric carts for folks (like Grandma) who can't walk long distances without assistance.Lots of handicapped parking places.The downside:Even with all the handicapped parking spaces, there is never any handicapped parking available because of the proximity to Sun City.This place is always packed and when I say packed, I mean like Christmas or before Superbowl Sunday packed. Given the clientele, the bathroom placement is not necessarily convenient.This Costco has a gas station and all of the other bells and whistles-including a car wash (which I didn't use but saw the sign for). It is probably best to come here right before closing time because lots of the SS crowd doesn't drive at night...~~#~0
Wife and I had the Omikase and wine pairing.  Our bill was a whopping $500.  We sat at the counter and enjoyed our visit with Nobu.  Pros - the food was very good (except for a ho hum dessert which was extra I believe) and presentation was beautiful.  The wine and sake pairing was excellent and very generously poured.Cons -  the portions are small, tiny, minuscule.  Even after three hours of eating, still hungry.  Quality usually trumps quantity but this was ridiculous.  My wife does not like raw fish so she asked for the cooked omikase - this turned out to be just my dishes omitting the raw fish.  She got even less food and ended up being hungry and grumpy.Overall, the place is over hyped.  That's a lot of money to pay to sit at a counter and eat not a lot  (albeit mostly tasty) food.  Definitely a foodie "I must follow the herd" place.~~#~0
When you live in the hot desert, you get parched.  Carly's has the cure for  any kind of cottonmouth.  Mojitos, cheap beers, draft beers, coffee - if it's wet, they got it.  I've been to a lot of cold kitchens, and I have to say that Carly's does it better than most.  The hummus is kickin', the sandwiches are scrumptious, and the salads are put together better than anywhere else I've been too.  I take away two stars because on some nights, I've had to wait for over thirty minutes to get a menu and water.  It's too bad... a couple of years ago, CARLY's WAS THE BEST PLACE TO EAT IN DOWNTOWN PHOENIX.  I wish they would start hiring younger go-getters and not bartenders that were fired from other restaurants.  Some of my friends would even go as far as to call this place "Snarly's".  It's funny, but not accurate.  Back to the grub... If you order the hummus, get it with veggies or bread instead of the terra chips.  You will run out of chips before you run out of hummus.  Orzo is highly underrated and Carly's knows this - they offer it as a side to any sandwich of their menu.  The portion is small, but the light feta sprinkles on the orzo will rock your world.~~#~0
This place is good for pizza or pricey salads. The salads are really tasty though. Just don't order the stuffed pizza they are all cheese and very heavy and gross.~~#~0
I'm tough on pizza places. This place is good. I truly enjoy the ingredients, and preparation. Atmosphere and service are lacking.~~#~0
We stopped by Caminero Mexican Restaurant the other day for breakfast.  We wanted a change to the "norm" breakfast routine and we found it at Caminero.  They are open for breakfast, lunch and dinner and offer dine it and take out.  They are small and a "dive-ish" type of place but serve good food.  I had their huevos con chorizo plate served with re-fried beans, rice and a flour/corn tortilla.  It was a huge plate full of Mexican goodness all for $5.99.  We also had their Mexican omelet which is made using three eggs, green chili's and your choice of meat smothered in their green sauce and cheese.  It too was a lot of food and tasty.They are some what of a "fast food" place but with very good service and they use real plates for their customer's when dinning in, so don't let the "dive-ish" ambiance deter you from trying them.  You won't be disappointed. I'm looking forward to going back very soon for lunch/dinner.  Hope to see you there.~~#~0
So, I was at work last night, flipping through a magazine, and there was a photo of a pie from pizzeria bianco.  It looked delicious.  Mouth watering.For the next two hours all I could think about was that pizza, the deep red sauce, dollops of fresh mozzarella, sliced tomatoes and basil, fire kissed crust.  Mmmm.I, however, do not live near down town, so needed to find a closer option.  Enter Neapolitan Wood Fired Italian.It was close, they do take out, and it was about $30 for two huge pizzas, which I can handle.  The staff was friendly and my order was ready right on time,  so nice work there.It even came with some bread sticks and dipping oil, nice touch.No fresh mozzarella, sad face.  The sauce was OK, the crust didn't have that fire kissed quality I was hoping for, but it was good.Overall, not bad, in all fairness I was craving bianco, and who can really live up to that?~~#~0
This was my choice for lunch to go last Wednesday.  I have been in this location at least a dozen times.  It always seems to be pretty busy (and noisy).  Today I chose the Sweet Fire chicken and the Honey Walnut shrimp, both items are not on their standard menu.  As usual I got the chow mein with mine, it is easier to eat with chop sticks than rice.  The food and service were fine and I was definitely full when finished.~~#~0
This was the first Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale that I tried.  It was close to home, we had been shopping all day, and decided to try it for a late lunch. I was disappointed - not because the food was bad, but because it wasn't much different than most of the Mexican restaurants in Spokane.  I was hoping for something more adventurous, more authentic, and not the Americanized Mexican food that is prevalent in Washington.That said, the food was as advertised, and was good for what it was.  The lunch special price was pretty much standard for the area, and the servings were large.  I did look at the individual items on the menu, and noticed the prices seemed high.  But since this was the first restaurant that we went to in Scottsdale, I just figured it was the area. The service was good, and the waitress was very friendly.To show how unimpressed I was, this is only about a half a mile from my place, and I have yet to find a reason to go back.  Again, the food wasn't bad, but I would rather drive to restaurants with more authentic and adventuresome recipes.~~#~0
This place is tucked away off the main street (very near Sens) which was our destination but this looked tasty and there was no wait so we ventured in.  The food was decent- nothing special in my opinion, but not terrible either.  The place is small and cozy- with a different vibe.I had the plantain avocado spring rolls which were way better than my entree-but perhaps I didn't order "wisely" and get the best entree. I had the Curried Chicken and Dumpling and I wouldn't recommend it.  I wasn't too crazy about the sauce.  The banana and plantains were the best part of the dish. The whole wheat dumpling served with my dish was disgusting- I couldn't take more than one bite and left it sit on the plate!Overall, it's not bad for the price but not great enough to make me ever want to return...~~#~0
Oy, stop trying so hard. Cheesy uniforms, design, bathrooms all for some pho-eco wanabe globally conscious restaurant with mediocre food at Scottsdale prices.Nothing other than the wine and Kale salad were memorable. The Bass was really watery with no crispness to the outsides, the tuna special app was really boring and my mom's lasagna was equally unmentionable. All three glasses of wine i had were damn good; the Evolution, DXG, and one other i forget. Really everything was far over priced and just not worth it.  Our server was however super knowledgeable but a little fawning.  I doubt i would come back save for some wine and a cheap salad otherwise i leave this to the Camelback Corridor housewives on trendy diets and health kicks. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XMMLRvV4IMxIGyc4H37LxA?select=Jxmrw-IXVOHX3WgfL-r0Nghttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XMMLRvV4IMxIGyc4H37LxA?select=24YjhsAUDhX4Jeh9pEUQzghttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XMMLRvV4IMxIGyc4H37LxA?select=7SCnxk6-hBOpC_r1oNgo2Qhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XMMLRvV4IMxIGyc4H37LxA?select=IWd58vjnTO1LbcIeWKuJpA~~#~0
Fairytale Brownies were amazingly professional and went above and beyond to try and make good for me as an unhappy customer.  Their service is unparalleled that is certain.I received a replacement batch of what I had ordered.  This time there was more carmel in the carmel brownies, more chocolate chips in the chocolate chips, etc but I confess as much as much as I wanted to love them it really wasn't IT for me.  I still think they need to be more moist but the company is clearly top notch and I am sure they will hammer it all out.  I really cannot express enough how impressed I was with the customer service.This matter was handled back in 2009 and I just never got around to making the update so I hope their product has improved to match the quality of their staff and the rest of their business.~~#~0
I had surgery here a few years ago and it went well.  I had to stay overnight so I got to taste their food... It was not that bad for hospital food.  The nurses are friendly and took good care of me.  Admitting and check in went very smoothly without any hang ups.~~#~0
Excellent breakfast selection and great dinner choices. I would recommend trying their crispy French toast for breakfast while sitting outdoors underneath the umbrellas with the Mummy Mountain scenic view! They also have yummy fish tacos and a nice artichoke appetizer to compliment your meal at dinner.~~#~0
My husband and I were driving through Phoenix on the way back to Las Vegas from Tucson and we needed some nourishment for the rest of the ride. I spotted a sign for Whataburger, which they do not have in Nevada, so we decided to get lunch there...Whataburger is good because they allow total customization of the burgers. My husband likes jalapenos, Whataburger has them on the menu. The actual meat isn't anything to write home about though, just a basic, somewhat boring burger. Service was friendly and the bathrooms were clean, so thumbs up for that. I still prefer In-N-Out though...~~#~0
Its yogurt, about 12 flavors. Nice and clean place.~~#~0
Great location and history here.  Overall a nice place but has really never blown me away.~~#~0
I've driven by this Filibertos many many times, considering I live right around the corner.  I finally got around to stopping in.At first, it looks like a mexican sonic.  seriously.  they have a walk up window, a drive through, and some tables outside to eat at.  I checked out the menu, and decided that I wanted the breakfast burrito...the Macaba or something...I got mine with shredded beef.  Holy crap was this thing big!  HUGE!  It was only $4 after tax, and I was STUFFED.  Plus, they made it while I waited in my car, so it was fresh.I really liked it here.  I like thier menu and they have lots of options.  Prices are great, and I really feel like you get a lot of food for very reasonable prices.  No, this place is not fancy, and its basically drive through Mexican, but its tasty, and very filling.~~#~0
there's nothing bad to say about zipps.  always a good burger that isn't going to cost you $12-$15 - like at the yardhouse or other place in old town.  great fries.  lots of tv's.  great place to slide in, grab a burger and a beer or three, and slide right out.~~#~0
No wifi and small TVs?! That should be fixed because the food and service are good.~~#~0
Went to see a movie last night here. The movie theater is nice but not as amazing as IPIC. Ordered a couple of popcorn's and my husband and guests complained they were stale. I took a bite and just thought it was cold. I returned it and got another cold batch. Oh well...the lady was nice and told me to come back in ten min if I wasn't happy and she would replace with fresh popcorn. My question here is why wouldn't you of just told me to come back in ten since you were making a fresh batch? Anyway seats are comfy and place is clean.~~#~0
Great margaritas! Really great. Strong. Too many will give you a headache though because they don't use the highest grade tequilla or anything. Still, it's a yummy buzz-giver. The chips and salsa are mediocre, and I assume the food is nothing special either... I haven't eaten anything here though, so I can't judge it on that. The ambiance is pretty nice - upstairs and downstairs is laid out pretty well and the lighting and furniture is comfortable. It's not too loud in there to have a conversation. They have a few crappy tvs playing basic cable sports usually. The crowd is slightly on the douchy side, but it makes for good people watching because everyone is pretty good looking.It's a good starting point to have a margarita or two before heading out somewhere fun.~~#~0
Not a bad airport, and the transportation routing makes it easy to get in and out . My only beef is that most of the restaurants, certainly almost all of the good ones, are outside of security. However, it's not hideous, it doesn't smell terrible, and stuff runs reasonably on time. I guess that's the most you can really ask from air travel these days.~~#~0
The food is excellent but the service is absolutely terrible. I've been going to this place for years and I'm on my forth time of telling myself to never go back due to the frustrating, slow service. Hey, I know that good food takes time to make but when I have to stand and wait for 15 minutes to get the food that I called in that I can see is just sitting on the counter well the blood pressure just gets raised too high to make the experience enjoyable. And the staff (other than the new guy that's now bringing out the food) don't seem to really care about the customers.   They hide behind the excuse that "good food takes time" but the hard reality is that they are just ultra inefficient and truly don't care to speed things up.  I'm sure at some point I'll cave in and return if I can't find a replacement deli but it sure would be great if they could improve the service.~~#~0
Z Tejas is one of those places where you know what you're going to get, you have a really good idea of what it's going to cost, and you know that pretty much everyone will be able to find something that they like.I have to say, I'm a sucker for the corn bread, and their Diablo Chicken Pasta is guilt-inducingly good. The Z has a wide variety of beverages, including their supposed killer margaritas, although if I'm being honest I've never really found them dangerously strong (they'll allow you to have a mere three).  The patio is the place to be, and while I'm not a huge fan of it being underneath the parking garage, it is a great place to do some people and Lamborghini watching.~~#~0
Use to love this place.  It was the place for me to go when I felt homesick from NY.  Not so much anymore.  Nothing tastes as good as it use too.  It wAs a much better restaurant at 32nd street.  Prices aren't very good either.  Not so much a fan as of lately.~~#~0
Old Country Buffett gets a bad rap but honestly to me their food (with the exception of the salad bar) is just as good as Golden Corral. The main difference is that this location of OCB and most others are terribly run down. I mean the atmosphere makes you feel poor for eating there. I like that they have a beverage bar here and you can get whatever beverage you want when you choose to (they have sodas, Icee's, and Cappuccino machines). The service is super friendly and accommodating, well worth the money- I just wish this place could get a remodel~~#~0
Nestled within Mekong Plaza, Chicken Noodle House serves up a pretty mean noodle soup.  The broth is very flavorful, whether you get a lighter soup vs. hearty soup, and the noodles taste fresh and are perfectly cooked.  Their other entree dishes, however, are less than spectacular.  Service, while very friendly, was slow.  On the upside, their prices are very reasonable and when we went they had a Thursday night deal where all the food was 1/2 price.~~#~0
They were late with my CT scan, but the associate apologized and stated that the previous appointment was late.  They sure were quick about getting the co-pay though, and then I could not get my detailed receipt for proof of service for my federal spending account until after.  Red tape, red tape, but the staff was really friendly.~~#~0
Bordering on 3.5.  It's all you can eat sushi and seafood for $16.The sushi was bland and dry.  The crab legs and cocktail shrimp were the best things here. They also have fried crab, fried shrimp, scallop on the shell, cooked salmon/white fish, bbq pork, short ribs, roasted duck, sausage, Korean bbq ribs, teriyaki chicken and grilled octopus.For dessert, they had 6 different flavors of ice cream, chocolate cake, strawberry cake, flan, angel cake and cookies -- all mediocre. This place is fine for the price and selection, but I doubt you're coming here for quality.  Next time, spandex pants.~~#~0
Dwaeji bulgogi was very good, a tad fatty but flavorful. The pan fried dumplings were much better in the sauce but were still kinda meh. Granted, we were there at lunch time and weren't able to get the full-on BBQ-at-your-table experience. The extras they give definitely gave you a tour of Korean cuisine, though I have to say their kimchi was kind of flavorless and didn't have any heat whatsoever. The large TV playing afternoon sitcom reruns did lower the class value of the place, considering I didn't see any kids running around, I'm not sure who all they had it on for.~~#~0
This review pertains to the lunch buffet only, I would expect a different experience at dinner.First off, the service was very "self serve" which is what one would expect from a buffet, but there are no self serve stations for water or tea refills, and the wait staff seldom made an appearance. The food was good, but I am not a fan of most buffets.  My friend informed me that the food was much better at dinner, and I intend on finding out sometime.~~#~0
I enjoyed Daphne's when I lived in Cali.   It was too bad they closed few locations.  I believe Scottsdale is the only location left.  I have ordered a Gyro to-go.  I was amazed how quickly it came out.  It was less than 5 minutes.  I was expecting the meat to be cold.  It was hot and delicious.   Of course another plus was that I had completed a survey from their website, and got a $5.00 coupon to use.  My Gyro was just $1.08, beats Mac'ds.~~#~0
I've been going to this gym for a couple of years now.  I have to admit, it ranks 10 times higher than the Pure Fitness gym I belonged to a mile down the road.  But, that doesn't mean that there isn't room for big improvements.Here's what I do like:Not too crowded and lots of equipment available for cardio workouts.The staff is friendly and seems to enjoy working there. The membership price is reasonable.Convenient location to my house.Cons...Last year the temperature in the gym during the summer was excruciatingly warm.  Imagine trying to do high intensity cardio in a sauna...that's what it felt like.  I know temperatures in gyms are supposed to be set at about 72 to 74 degrees.  The temperature readings I saw on the thermometers were consistently 78 and 79 degrees.  I mentioned this several times to management and all I got was those temperatures aren't correct and that they would look into it. (As you can see, this one is big for me.)Management doesn't seem to address concerns of members.Only one time have I seen a trainer or staff go through and pick up the area putting weights in their proper place and cleaning up any trash on the floor.  (Hey, they shouldn't have to clean up after members I know but...not all members have the integrity to put the weights away themselves after using them.)I watch some of the TVs while doing cardio.  Sometimes they have trash shows that do nothing to motive me on the TV.  When working out I need something to inspire me to keep focused and energized and not bring me down.  Jerry Springer and the news with all of it's negative stories doesn't do it.  How about a couple of sports channels, health channel, and some feel good kind of stuff?I'll keep going to the gym because of price and convenience but if another option became available, I would check it out in a heart beat.~~#~0
We went on a Saturday night at 6:30 pm and the noise was deafening. If you have hearing problems, it's not worth. Who wants to shout through your meal? The sound problem needs to be addressed. We enjoyed the  delicious spinach salad and our pizza was great.  Our waiter Jesse was very attentive and on top of things. We appreciated the flexibility to substitute ingredients on our pizza. We vowed to return only when going early, or if we can sit on the patio.~~#~0
While one of the healthier choices in Arizona, I wasn't impressed with their food, nor their service. I've only been to the one in Chandler.While the fare isn't terrible, I just don't find it overly flavorful. I've had the hummus, and the lavosh salmon wrap. The wrap was pretty disappointing for me.I'll probably go again just to see if something else on the menu will wow me. And if my opinion changes, I will come back & update.~~#~0
There are many varieties of herbal teas & assorted muffins.  My favorite is zucchini nut muffin which is closely followed by carrot.  The cookies are great, too.  Walking  to this location saves gas and it's a good workout.  My ideal lunch is soup and salad, or a quiche, or a sandwich or an omelet. Everything I have eaten here is quite tasty and, since I'm a regular here, I can't agree with some of the other reviewers. Generally the wait staff is efficient, friendly and helpful. Rating could be a 3.5 stars if they practice a smoother customer line formation and faster service on Saturdays.~~#~0
This is a Red Robin. If you want the typical American food joint, this is your place. We had a very friendly waiter and overall enjoyed our experience. I was very surprised that a martini was under $5! Compared to most places with food and drinks, the drinks were relatively inexpensive.~~#~0
The husband and I almost always order the baked chicken wings (no sauce), the Greek Salad, and the Puttanesca pizza. Oh, the Puttanesca pizza... yum. We've tried a few other things, but these are definitely our favorites. The happy hour drink specials aren't anything special, but all appetizers are 50% off. There are lunch specials as well, but we really like this place as a quick dinner spot. They have a power card, so every $100 spent, you get $10 off. This is nice and can add up quickly. For an Arizona chain, this place has some good gourmet pizza.~~#~0
We're just finishing our lunch from Touch of Thai now. On everyone's recommendation, we chose to order out, and I'm glad we did. The strip mall was horrifying (ToT is next to a biker bar), and the restaurant decor was almost enough to make us turn right back around.Our server was adorable. Cute high school kid, really eager, came over and chatted with us while we waited for our order. He was just effortlessly likable and efficient. Major points here.We ordered just the basics: the chicken satays, the pad thai, and the shrimp and pineapple red curry. The portions were what I would consider lunch-sized, though we ordered from the dinner menu. Thai food to me is about the spices- the portions can easily be bulked up with tofu or veggies or something.The satays were okay, nothing special, but done nicely. I've had better pad thai at Pei Wei. Blech. But the red curry... I'll admit to drinking the extra broth, it was just so good. It was creamy and well spiced and cooked long enough to bring out the flavor without tasting like it had  been going all day. It could have used a little more "meat"... even if not shrimp, maybe some veggies or tofu or something.We got everything medium hot, which wasn't hot at all. Spiced, but not hot. Next time (and there will be a next time), I'll ask for "Thai hot". The lunch prices on the menu were great. I wish we had gone then. As it was, our bill for an app and two entrees was over $30, which was a bit much.~~#~0
So I give it three stars.  It is really good pizza, but most defnitely not worthy of the best pizza in the country.  One thing I did not like was the lack of sauce.  There is NO sauce, "white pizza".  Not a whole lof of choices, but I guess they do that because they are always so packed and need to make sure they get pizza's out in a timely manner.  The caprese salad was really yummy.  They use olive oil instead of a balsamic reduction, so it is different.  I thought the crust could have used some flavor so I really didn't eat it (too burnt anyway), but I really like how they blended the cheeses, meats and vegetables for the toppings.  We had a party of 10, so I was able to try a slice from three pies, but I can't pick a best because they are all so very unique.  I will probably go back, but I thought a pizza, splitting a caprese salad and one glass of wine just for me, is a little pricey at 40 dollars.~~#~0
The place is wicked cute and homey... however, their coffee has a lot to be desired. A bit bitter with a strange after taste...~~#~0
I enjoyed the Fry Bread as the bread itself was very delicious especially when topped with beans and cheese with the bread being an above average size.  Prices have gone up as a Fry Bread with bean and cheese will run you $6.28 after taxes and if you want to add a drink to that you can count on at least another $2.00.For me the price isn't worth coming back on a regular basis.  The beans didn't have much taste but you can add salt and salsa to your bread if you want to add more taste.Overall, if you are in the mood for some fry bread this is a good place to get a quick fix.  Although, I would have to say that the fry bread sold annually at the State Fair taste much better.Special note, they have a child's size fry bread with bean and cheese with a drink for $3.95 plus tax.  Interestingly, the child's size is not too much smaller than the full size.  So if you want to save some $$$ you can always order take out and get the child's size fry bread !~~#~0
Went here for my bday and location was superb and staff was friendliest I've ever dealt with at a hotel.Basically, I give 5 stars for price and staff. 4 stars for location, atmosphere, and style. But only 2 stars for beds and room. We stayed in a dbl room, which I should have asked for King, but I wanted an extra bed just in case someone was too drunk to drive home. The full beds were so small! The room was stylish and hip and I liked it, but I have felt more comfortable in other places of the same price. It was only the comfort level that brings review to a 3-star.As far as others saying you could hear music all night, I didn't in my room. And there are a ton of clubs within earshot. I actually don't mind that at all. We spent a majority of our time around the fire pit and having drinks in the bar. I had more fun there then when we went out for a night on the town. I might stay there again, but definitely stay if you are looking for one night only. If you need to stay somewhere for more than one night, check out other places that are pricer because you will get more amenities and luxury.~~#~0
This place isn't awful but I don't think it's worth standing in line for either. I like the cake and the frosting, they are delicious but they're not "cravings" worthy. I had the vanilla hazelnut and you couldn't even taste the hazelnut?? It tastied like whipped milk chocolate which is fantastic if that's what i wanted. When i hear hazelnut is in a frosting.. i expect more of a nutella flavor explosion.  Im not saying I wouldn't return but I wouldn't go out of my way.~~#~0
I seriously love Pita Jungle. I've been eating at the Tempe location since it was a little hole in the wall but this location at Ray and Dobson is just too busy (I think). As much as I love the food I think the kitchen staff should take a little more time in preparing their dishes. The other day I ordered a lentil salad for lunch that was soo delicious but I'm 99% sure the rice was bad and I became violently ill right after lunch. Too bad... Secondly, I ordered a vegan version of a meal that did have chicken in it and substituted it for tofu for my vegan friend. I came home with the food to come to find chicken was in his meal. This could have been really bad if we didn't notice it right away. I just hope that someone from Pita can read this post and realize that a loyal customer just wants to give some constructive criticism. I love this restaurant but if I keep running into these situations I'm going to have to deem it another careless chain restaurant which is NOT what I'd want to do at all.~~#~0
I've stopped into Tony's Italian Delicatessen twice now, so I guess it is deserving of a review. It possesses that "real", not manufactured old world delicatessen that seems to be on the verge of extinction. The owners are very friendly and accommodating. In my two visits I've had the meatball sub and the hot pastrami sandwich, both were just okay. They were reasonably priced, so no complaints there, but they just seemed to lack the full flavor I was hoping for. I would def. stop here before a chain/franchise sub shop, but I have had better in the valley.  I still have plans on stopping in to try out their pizza, I'll update my review once completed.~~#~0
This place is defintiely a hole in the wall, but aren't all the best finds that way? Their horchata was delicious. Creamy and authentic, without being to cinnamon-y. I was also a HUGE fan of their papussas and empanadas. Amazing!. I did not like their take on chile relleno though. It was a stuffed piece of the palm flower they use and it tasted acrid. Maybe it's a flavor that grows on you. Also wasn't too impressed by how clean the place felt, but the old pictures of the Valley in the 30s were pretty cool.Overall, good food and totally reasonably priced, but i would've loved to have a beer with my dinner. Only juices and sodas at this place.~~#~0
As far as car washes without the annoying sales people is concerned, this place was okay. All the nasty bugs from my most recent road trip were cleaned off, and the dryer did its trick on my car.What was very amusing were all the pigeons and pigeon poop everywhere! Even the machine that spun had probably the largest collection of bird nests Arizona has ever seen! Pigeons were sitting here and there just enjoying themselves and completely not caring about the ruckus with the car wash machinery. Very odd. I only came here because it's down the street from Target.~~#~0
This place is aggravating.I think it's because when you hear of Mexican food in the Phoenix Metro area... this is place ALWAYS gets mentioned... and WHY?? ugh, aggravating!And then you go... and are like "Okay... I can see it, the duck pond is purty." and then u enter and are stared at by every half drunk person in the bar and are then shown to your table. It's a little busy and people seem to be enjoying themselves.... alright, another good sign of goodness to come. The chips and salsa are even decent.... and then the server comes. And she can BARELY speak a word of English... you try and try and still can't understand her and then u just give up and point to the menu like you're some drunken college student stopping off at Denny's before heading back to the dorm after a CRAZY night at the frat house! She writes some stuff down and then after what feels like an eternity, she plops down a HUGE plate of whatever you ordered and all it's rubbery good-less. *shudders*yup, aggravating. You try and try and become convinced that something isn't right. You think, what IS that flavor?? Nana never made anything that tasted like THAT!! But alas, your efforts are in vain... that's the horrifying facts of this would be chain. It's 90% processed foods. It's not that good. And it's what I call "safe" Mexican food. and it's very tourist friendly, it IS right next to a resort! And for some strange reason, it makes the list of places to dine when hankering for "authentic" Mexican food. Yup... aggravating.~~#~0
Good pizza - yes! The best pizza I've ever had - no. This place was more about the experience and ambiance than the actual pizza for me. Just like everyone tells you, you're going to wait 2.5 to 3 hours for a table for two. Sounds ridiculous, but just be prepared to make an evening out of it (and do not come starving). We sat at the bar next door during our wait which is a fabulously cozy, home. They have small shared plates and a nice selection of beer and wine to choose from while you wait. When it came to the actual pizza - yes, it was good but I think you can find better - or at least comparable elsewhere. Overall, great expereience but not worth the hype.~~#~0
I typically workout at Tempe YMCA, but while they had their parking lot redone, I tried out the Ahwatukee YMCA, since it is almost the same distance for me. The facility itself is considerably larger and more modern than Tempe and the staff will certainly mention it to you with no hidden pride. If you like to do cardio, they seem to have enough treadmills, ellipticals and bikes for you and a battalion of other cardio bunnies. All are new and in good condition. There also numerous weight machines, although none are duplicated. The free weights area is rather spacious. The squat rack is not adjustable, so people that are too short, too tall or want to use it for deadlifts or bent over rows are out of luck. Next to free weights area is a small space where 3-4 people can do stretching, yoga or whatever.There are two types of lockers. The ones in the changing area require you to bring your own lock or hope that no one gets into them. There are also very (VERY) small lockers outside where you can put your keys/wallet and the keys are provided. I found the setup a bit inconvenient, as Tempe YMCA provides keys to the lockers in change room. I've only worked out here in the evenings and the results have been quite varying. Overall, the most popular area is the cardio, of course. There are some people in the weight machine area and even less people in free weights area. Tempe Y has considerably more people battling for the bench press, squat rack, etc. Weights are usually decently organized, but at a recent Friday evening workout they were all thrown around at random or stacked in reverse order. Just getting the necessary weights was a workout in itself. Barbell on squat rack frequently disappear and none of the staff so far have been able to help me find it, so I resorted to stealing one from the bench press. Granted, the staff did not know what a barbell is anyway.In the evenings you get a wide range of people working out, from old to high schoolers. Most are polite. Some old perverts (as noted by another poster) are also around, so beware. As expected, they are cowards and getting them to stop is not an issue if you catch them. Weight machines are frequently occupied by  women that spend more time talking to each other than actually doing anything. I've seen two women spending 15 minutes between two of them to do 20 reps on one machine.I'd give more stars if the weights were better organized and if some of the people were more aware of the fact that other people use machines as well. Tempe YMCA has considerably more people using weights, yet it is not any worse in being organized. Still, I will be coming back to Ahwatukee from time to time just to enjoy working out among the native Ahwatukeans.Addition: Recently noticed that a bunch of 19-23 year olds have a tendency to wear t-shirts with "cut-off" sleeves. And by "cut-off" I mean missing entirely all the way to their trunks. None of them ever use towels either, so you get to enjoy their sweat on the benches while admiring their baby fat tires that betray their overdeveloped arms. YMCA does have a dress code, but I am pretty sure that no one gives a rats tail. So bring your own towel, may be even two and be ready to see more exposed nipples in the gym than in the pool.~~#~0
Try their "hot sauce" on your burger. Good!This particular five guys is fairly new.  My family likes the fries when they're hot.  The burgers aren't cheap, but they are very good and the toppings selection is also very good.The drink dispensers are a family favorite.  They love mixing flavors with their Sprite or Coke.It's a God-awful dirty mess in there with Peanut shells and dirty tables everywhere as they try to keep up.It's your typical 5 Guys.  if you like them, you won't be disappointed in this one.~~#~0
The Caramel Banana Pecan French Toast was just good, the best part of it was the brioche bread, it was sweet and buttery. What would I have changed? Instead of straight caramel sauce I would have made a caramel syrup. The syrup would have given it the feel of French toast and not made ne feel like I consumed a cup of caramel. Also the bananas we doused in the caramel which made them gooey, I would prefer fresh bananas on top. And lastly they just sprinkle plain pecans on top, they need to candy the pecans in butter, brown sugar and cream cheese. As for the biscuits, they were sooooo tasty, moist, unique and satisfying. The only downfall is it said jalapeño on the menu and there was not one hit of jalapeño. I was looking for a good kick in the pants spice, but nothing.  But still worth the eat for sure!!I definitely suggest going to Over Easy. They have a unique and classic menu and they taste so fresh. Next time I'll try the waffle dogs and the chicken fried steak!~~#~0
Uuuugh, Tempe Marketplace. An otherwise clean, relatively quiet (noisy college kids vs. screaming tweens), fast service providing, good movie showing theater that has the misfortune of being located in the mega-strip mall of Tempe Marketplace. This place has stars knocked off for accessibility and other issues tied to location. RIP Centerpoint, Mill Ave Harkins.~~#~0
I've never been here for dinner or a meal or anything like that, but I have been here a few times for karaoke. The first time I went, it was a little hard to see form the road as the sign was dim but I made it. The place is clean and the staff is nice. They stay on top of the bill and last time split checks with ease :)No matter how packed the place gets they're always there to make sure your glass stays full. When I was DD, I was never charged for my soda or water.. or if I was, someone else put it on theirs.The karaoke runs fairly smoothly, but the selection of songs is pretty lacking, at least for my taste.~~#~0
I'm really torn about Farrelli's. The concept is fabulous: lunch or dinner at the movies. And their Fall movie festival is fantastic, with classics like Breakfast at Tiffany's (which I had never seen before today), and the upcoming Beetlejuice, The Unforgiven, Forrest Gump, and the Wizard of Oz. I just wish their food was as good as their menu made it sound.We settled on the Baked Brie al'orange, and at first we thought the waitress had brought us out something quite other than what the menu described. Turns out the orange marmalade and candied pecans were a fine sprinkling on top of the cheese, under the layer of so-called puff pastry. The puff pastry was "dead," so to speak, as if it had been out and in the fridge for days. The brie was not very high quality, and the bread was stale. My burger was overcooked, and Hubby's veggie wrap was just ok, but we agree that the fries were really good and super crispy. The iced tea was good and strong, and the waitress kept our glasses filled. I wished we had gotten the popcorn, as we had when we came here before. God, I dream about that popcorn. Like what you would make at home on the stove, with salt and real butter- if you had the energy, that is.The seats were comfy, and the audience full of women kept pretty quiet, except the times when Holly's cat was in danger and nearly abused. We're headed back for "The Unforgiven", another classic I have never seen, but plan to choose other menu items. Maybe just the popcorn....~~#~0
"The Sub that Sunk"  A solid three stars for the customer service at this new location with friendly service with the staff that seemed to be enjoying there time working with each other.  I did receive my free sub for the grand opening of this location, however even though the deli meats were sliced in front of you to prove the freshness of their ingredients, my Italian sub was "A-OK."  I would consider going again because of the service, but maybe a second try with a different sub will satisfy my sub appetite.  I kept comparing it to Jimmy Johns Subs which are much tastier, however service is lacking.~~#~0
I wanted to love this place, it's close, convenient and it has different types of bacon.  It is because I wanted love it that it got 3 stars.  My guy and I stopped for breakfast Saturday morning, it took awhile to be seated but once we were the service wasn't bad for as busy as they were.  We both got eggs, hash browns, bacon and toast. I ordered my Applewood smoked bacon extra crispy, he ordered the jalapeno bacon not crispy.This is where the stars began to fall.  It took forever for our food to arrive.  Several people who came in after us had their meals and were finished by the time ours arrived.  The hashbrowns were hot, the eggs warm and unfortunately his bacon was extra crispy and mine wasn't even close to crispy.  I don't mind the food mixup so much as the waiting.  We will give them another try and I will update then.~~#~0
This place closed down a few weeks ago. Their website was down and their phone number was busy. I drove by and the place is closed and a chainlink fence is up around the building. It was a good place and close to my house. Now we go to Golden Canyon on Southern and Dobson for chinese food.~~#~0
Now. First and Foremost. Are you looking for food court eats? Are you looking for lunch, a snack or some dinner? If so, this Target is not the place for a food court meal/snack. When I think of going to Target, I don't think about going there to eat their fast food culinary creations. Skip the food court (your arteries will also thank you) and check out the rest of this Target. It isn't that bad but it's not amazing either. Here are some things this Target is good for:- Prescription refills!!!!!!! The Pharmacy is where this Target really shines - it deserves 5 stars. If you want to wait for your prescription to be filled, go here! They are faster than the speed of light, and they have tons of super cheap $5 generics. Also, I HIGHLY recommend it because the staff is incredibly friendly and they put customer service first. - Munchies, candy, gum, soda, beer & wine! They also have a good seasonal shopping selection too.- There is a Starbucks inside but since it isn't a stand alone store so expect to wait as it's manned by one employee.- Cheap yet fashionable clothing. If you have a great eye for fashion (be honest with yourself) you can find some classic wardrobe pieces here. BUT, if you don't have good taste in clothing, you could potentially walk out of here with something ugly.- Impulse shopping. Want to blow some cash? Go to Target and you can drop $100 in the blink of an eye.- I've also returned stuff here and I've never had an issue. It was fast and painless.This Target is conveniently located but it's also in a ghetto fabulous area of Arcadia. So lucky for us shoppers, there's a security guard to watch over us and our vehicles. How thoughtful of Target to employ someone who puts safety first, right? It's not the biggest or the cleanest Target, I wish the selection was a tad larger and it's not a Super Target with full-on grocery shopping like fresh vegetables - but it does get the job done. And I really mean it about the Pharmacy, it's awesome.~~#~0
I went here for restaurant week really expecting a great meal. There were four places I went during the week and this was the first one I tried. I thought the service was very good and a few of the dishes had a lot of flavor. I definitely enjoyed the beef tenderloin and the jack daniel's pecan pie. The pecan pie was actually very sweet and bursting with flavor, it was a good way to end my meal. Also the bread was great, very tasty croissants.However, there is obviously a reason I gave Vincent's only 3 stars....I thought the lobster bisque was very bland. I was very excited to try their bisque, but it didn't knock my socks off at all. The duck confit was very dry. It came with tasty scalloped potatoes, but sadly they were the highlight of the entree, not the duck. Overall there were a lot of good things I did try, but to me, my first and second course should be excellent, and the dessert should not be by far  the best course I had.~~#~0
I have been to other Good Eggs in the valley but this one is my favorite of all the locations. Maybe because this location doesn't have as much of the 80's country kitchen decor as others. Most likely it's due to the staff being very friendly and speedy. I had the eggs benedict florentine with country potatoes. I don't know if I was extra hungary but it tasted pretty good. It is not anything fancy but makes a decent hearty Sunday breakfast. I like that they give you your own  pitcher of water and an urn of your own coffee.~~#~0
They advertise authentic Indian fast food and have a very simple menu. I ordered the chicken curry, mild, which had a lot of flavor and even a little bit.  I ordered the combo to go which comes with rice and 1/2 naan but they forgot to include the naan in my order.  The dish was mostly rice with very little gravy but did have some large chicken pieces in it.  For $7.12 with tax I didn't feel it as that great of a value, even if I had received the naan.  The place just opened and you can tell they are still working out the kinks.  Maybe I'll try it again in a few months to see if things have improved but until then I'll stick to what I know.~~#~0
Wi-fi rarely works. Parking bus system is slow and frustrating. The terminals need a makeover.~~#~0
Pretty good but still not quite what I was hoping for. My family is Taiwanese and I miss my mom and grandma's cooking. So I've been trying to find a place that has Taiwanese style dishes to satisfy my cravings. I just haven't been able to find a place in Arizona that gets the Beef Noodle Soup just right. I tried the beef noodle soup here, it was ok, so far the closest to what I'm used to but still not quite there. I was also hoping for some yummy scallion pancakes but they didn't have them just by themselves, instead you can get beef wrapped in green onion pancake. What if I just want the green onion/scallion pancakes? Anyways, it was ok, just not super memorable.  Our server was really sweet and attentive. I will probably go back to try some of their other dishes and the ramen. Still looking for a great ramen place out here too.~~#~0
Try the lemonade with mint.  yummmm!     The food is very fresh, but depending on what you're looking for ......it's more asian than vegetarian in my opinion.~~#~0
1st visit had the lo mein...delish!  2nd visit had the teriyaki...fine if you like salt.  Ick!~~#~0
Great happy hour. Burgers are solid and mini pork shanks are delicious. Although we sat at the bar, the service wasn't great as they forgot about us. But could have been just one of those days. But I would definitely try this place out.~~#~0
great for parties for children. Fun place to go for the child who is obsessed with trains. Lots of open space/grass for games and running around. A good handful of places with covering over picnic style benches. Not sure if you reserve it or if its first come first though.Don't go in the summer because it is 90% outdoors and you WILL die if you go in the summer. The fall or spring would be perfect here.~~#~0
Bad News on the Last Chance Front, Kids... It has sucked the last two time I have been there. Let me tell you about the old days...long ago when a young woman , strike that, a lady went to Last Chance , she could walk away with a large bag or two chocked full of treasures and bargains...great shoes dirt cheap , shiny purses with a little shop wear, earrings for 1.97  , necklaces ,maybe, even a high count sheet  or towel ,  beautiful sweaters for 9.97 ... jeans  galore and always tons of tshirts.. but I miss those days. Now the goods are looking more trashed and the prices are on the rise..beat up shoes are 29.00 , trashed wallets 15.00 , t-shirts are still okay and managed to find 1 faux daughter some jeans  , but thats about it . The glory days of Last Chance may be over.~~#~0
Why?That's all I can really think. Why? Why do most people prefer generic chain restaurants over the local flair? Why is it that places like PF Chang's are considered "like, oh my god, sooo good!"? Why? I mean, the food is edible. It has flavor. The  menu offers variety. You get to eat your food in a comfortable setting with somebody waiting on you, refilling your glass, clearing the table... And then you get to go back to your ordinary lives.Ok, so maybe I'm being a little too hard on PF Chang's. I'm not the first person to diss chain restaurants. I'm not even the first to secretly admit to liking a few. I do. But, when given the option of exploring a local eatery that sells more than the "paint by numbers" entrees, I'll pick the original, exciting and off-the-beaten-path place 99.4% of the time.~~#~0
First, I think it's important to remember what L'Academie is: this is Scottsdale Culinary Institute's casual, bistro-style restaurant. As such, every encounter with staff is an encounter with a student, from the host stand to the table service to the kitchen. Last night, we spotted the fruit and cheese plate on the dessert table upon our entrance. You see, while the menu is seasonal (maybe to coincide with semesters?), the desserts are changed out more frequently to allow for creativity of the student chefs. The offerings are displayed along with some featured beverages which you are forced to pass as you enter the dining room... a great way to remind you to save room (wink, wink). I guess you could say we had dessert first!Our "starter" featured slices of Manchego, and wedges of blue cheese and a smokey brie bordered by walnuts, pistachios, dried figs, apricots and cranberries and halved red and green grapes. Only real complaint: there were too few pieces of crostini (although we were graciously brought more upon request) and some of the green grapes had browned. Overall, it was a nice way to start the meal.I had the five onion soup. A velvety potage, the soup's aroma was slightly better than its flavor. A bit heavy on the pancetta and worcestershire for my taste.The presentation of the crab cakes  was lovely. Three timbales of crab and peppers surrounded a small bunch of fresh greens bound by a tomato slice. The vinaigrette on the greens was a highlight.L'Academie has a notable wine selection. I was delighted to find Molly Dooker's 2007 The Maitre D Cabernet Sauvignon on the list! Deliciously oaked goodness!Truth be told, it feels like a cross between a classroom and an average American bistro. But, you know what? That's what it is... and, what better way to support young people who love food as much as we do and want to spend their career bringing it to us?!~~#~0
It was that time of year again, and I have to say that I'm still somewhat unimpressed. This place has such great potential, but its face just seems to keep writing a check that your stomach can't check. The devil is in the details, and for some reason, the details all fall short here. Its not that the food is bad...its quite good, actually. But for the price you pay, it should be perfect, not "quite good". Specifically, every bit of cooked meat that was offered was over-cooked and dry. Homemade chicken sausage looked delicious, but was nearly flavorless and seriously, I think I could get a more moist piece of chicken cooking it in the microwave. The fresh grill was lamb, which I love. Again, very very dry. That just sucks.And again, as with my last review from a year ago, if I'm spending the extra money on an entree, don't then give me an item on my plate that is readily available on the buffet that is included in the price. That makes me feel ripped off, and that your chefs are just plain lazy.So, for not fixing anything in the last year, I'm demoting this place by a star. I did, however like the new buffet and menu items. And, as always, the staff was friendly and attentive, professional and unobtrusive. Keep that up, but fix the stupid shit please! See you in a year.~~#~0
After receiving $35 in game cards for Dave and Buster's from my workplace for winning a contest, I invited my boyfriend to come with me last night for dinner and games. The dinner part was a mistake.We first approached the hostess stand to try and get a table in the main dining area (not the bar). The hostess seemed really clueless when we asked her how long it would be. She just said "ummmmm....." and turned around to stare at the dining room (for about 5 minutes). There were clearly a few dirty tables and some empty ones that were clean, but she told us it would be a 20 minute wait. So, we tried looking for a table in the bar area and found one immediately that another couple had just gotten up from. I hailed the bartender to ask if he could send someone over to clean the table. After waiting another 5-10 minutes or so, our waitress finally came over and cleaned the table for us. The service was fine; nothing to write home about, but I do understand that a) It was a very busy saturday night, and b) we were sitting in the bar area and not drinking, so I wasn't expecting stellar service. We did get everything we needed within a pretty reasonable amount of time, considering the previous factors. The food, on the other hand, was completely underwhelming. I felt like I wasted $40 on that dinner, to be honest. I ordered some kind of seafood and steak 'trifecta', and it was anything but that. It was kind of lukewarm, the steak was super tough and well done even though I asked for medium rare. Although they were small pieces on skewers and I do understand it's harder to cook those to a specified temperature, they were decidedly overcooked. I thought the shrimp were supposed to be in some kind of sauce and grilled, but they just looked like plain pink cocktail shrimp somebody had stuck on a skewer popped in the microwave for a few seconds. The best part of the meal was the rice pilaf it was all served over. My boyfriend got a chicken parmesan sandwich which he was pretty happy with, but I tasted it and thought it was kind of gross too. We skipped dessert and went on to play some games.The games were great, no complaints there! At the end of the night we earned 1450 tickets which got me one pretty awesome stuffed elephant and a shot glass for both myself and my boyfriend.Bottom line: Go for the games (and maybe booze); get the dinner somewhere else. There are way too many good options nearby to waste your money here on subpar food.~~#~0
We had pizza in the bar, and it was pretty good, but we were really impressed with the service.  Even though we were a bit concerned that we had walked in 20 minutes prior to closing time, the waitress (and even the busboy) was so friendly.  What we also noticed was that people were picking up carryout orders left and right.  Next time, we'll try that!~~#~0
Went back on my own to try again.  Have to say I still find the smoke to be overpowering on the meat.  Service was great.  Portions were large. Better experience, however it's not my kind of BBQ.~~#~0
I like this place.  It has so much potential.  The concept is 1/2 Fast Food & 1/2 Full Service Restaurant.....it's a 'Tweener'!  Let me explain......Fast Food Elements+ You order at a counter, menu on boards against the wall.+ They call for your number & you pick up your food at the counter....food is served on plastic plates & trays, like many fast food restaurants.+ Food comes out relatively fast.+ Self Serve Salsa Barhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/emtAyZPvp_0b40levOzcnA?select=bJL2f4dqLkQZePWU13UCswFull Service Restaurant Elements+There's bar seating w/Alcohol service.+ Food quality is a notch above Fast Food.+ Food prices are nearly the same as full service restaurants.+ Complimentary Chips & Salsa.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/emtAyZPvp_0b40levOzcnA?select=0LCjnbhWGXS6ZMtp_137eAI've been here a few times....being on my no Meat diet, I have some good choices here.Bean & Cheese Burrito, $5.49http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/emtAyZPvp_0b40levOzcnA?select=hJcWsnkgB9Br9ZnpFV7NLANachos w/Cheese & Beans, *Hint* Get the Kid's Meal for $4.99http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/emtAyZPvp_0b40levOzcnA?select=yrX3FWg6cyzFNi5HvQuwEAQuesadilla, $4.99http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/emtAyZPvp_0b40levOzcnA?select=OgFy34v2UTeOvSSc4ffy0gThe food is pretty good....not great.

The other big bonus for me is that they have Arizona Gunslinger Hot Sauce available here....http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/emtAyZPvp_0b40levOzcnA?select=FJbrO9TXOs5J-gp_psFn0wThis Hot Sauce packs a nice punch and I pour it generously on my food....yum!Overall, it's not a bad joint......way better than Taco Bell, just under Full Service joints.Return Factor - 90%~~#~0
Experience:::: on Friday Night,Atmosphere :  outside, nice patio overlooking grassy area, with band for some  fun entertainment  Waitress: 1st Impression : Zombie like, but does  manage at tip time to muster  a matel  like farewell, but we did get refills on our drinks promptly. Food : we ordered a forgettable  caesar salad, the dressing was more oily than creamy. MEH, MEH,Pizza : sausage, onion, garlic were the topping of choice. The flavor was good but the infrastructure of  pizza  was poor. Full on soggy, drowned core!   What happened to Crispy crust?   Well I guess nothing if I  was only counting the circumference of the pie. This place was going to get a  2 star, but I upped it to 3 because the manager came over later very gregarious & warm and asked how everything was? So rare now a days. We didn't complain but figured we might have experienced on off pie, anyway the ingredients were fresh & good quality.  Hubs & I are partial to  pizza we've  had in St. Louis, so far  the best ever by far.~~#~0
I shop here frequently for hair color and nail products because I live close by. I wish I had $10 for each time I received different coloring tips from employees; I'd be able to quit my job and retire to the Caribbean.Every employee with whom I have spoken in this Sally's has given me different advice; always the complete opposite of what I had been told before. Shouldn't employees at Sally's have to go through special training? Employee #1- "You don't want the red tones in your hair? You should get the 6N to neutralize the red." Employee #2- "You have red tones in your hair? You should get the 6NN. The 6N will give you red tones."What?! Needless to say, I still have coppery red tones AND a greenish tint in my hair.~~#~0
The food sucks... don't order the fried pickles, ever!It's a total dive... don't sit down in the restrooms, ever!The bartenders are good, the games are fun, and they have pool. What more can you ask for? I've been here a hundred times after work, and there is always something going on. It's definitely an "industry" bar if you know what I mean... always full of bartenders, waiters, and hotel people. We go here because it's cheap, a good place to wind down after work, and they have golden tee.~~#~0
Thai Basil would have won a 4-star from me if their service was better, because the food is delicious!First of all, the decor is lovely - it's modern Asian flair that isn't stuffy or over the top. I loved the bench seating style with the cushions - very comfy.The food was tasty - I was actually worried it'd be a bit watered down (this is my first Thai Basil visit EVER)  but it was actually good. It could have been a tad spicier (I tried to play it safe with the medium but ended up dousing my food in peppers anyway) but it was still enjoyable. I had lunch with 3 of my friends, and I shared pad thai with one (my favorite Thai dish - it wasn't the best pad thai I'd ever had, but I will go back for more) and I had the chicken panang. I like the panang to be a bit sweeter, but it was still delicious. As far as the service, I hate to say that it's your average small-time Asian restaurant service. Everyone basically seems rushed all the time, no one was personable, and they just did the bare minimum - take orders, drop off food, and I honestly can't remember anyone smiling. We sat without our waters refilled for quite some time and only had it refilled when our food arrived. There really wasn't much else to it.If the service improves, I'm sure the tips will too. But I'll definitely come back for the great food.~~#~0
This is a solid little sub shop in Westgate Center. The ordering process is a little different from most places. Instead of walking up to counter and telling an employee what you want, you grab a brown bag off the wall and mark what you want with a Sharpe. It seems a little odd at first, but this actually helps speed up the process (which takes a little bit of time since all of the subs are toasted). Like any sub shop, there's a huge selection of meats and toppings, and you can stuff any sandwich with nearly anything you can think of. The price is also pretty good at less than 6 bucks. However, the basic sub is not enough to satisfy a normal appetite for more than an hour or two. Your best bet is to either get a side of chips, or go for extra meat (dollar upcharge), or double meat (2 dollar upcharge). That's really my only gripe with Which Which. I would give it four stars, but once you start paying for the extras, you're getting close to gourmet sandwich prices, for subs that are significantly smaller than Quizno's or Jimmy John's.  If you're looking for something sweet, I highly recommend a shake or malt.  It's way better at Which Which than at most burger places!One thing to note, the employees here are always really friendly and cool. They deserve five stars. I've stopped by here a few times over the past couple of years, and never had a bad experience with any of them. They always seem to be having a good time behind the counter.If you're heading to an event at the arena or stadium, this a great spot to grab a bite before heading in to save some cash on concessions.  But Which Which certainly isn't a place that I would hop into my car and drive out of my to.~~#~0
Whoa, great-tasting-gyro-salad!!  I went here the other day as a sort of pit-stop before heading to Gold Bar when my friend and I realized we were all of a sudden hungry.  I had no idea this place was even here, but we discovered it just driving around looking for some 'refreshing' food.  (who really wants to eat a non-refreshing greasy pizza or fast food when it's freakin' 115 degrees outside?)  So glad we did!The place is clean, the food is good, the prices are reasonable (specials appear to be a daily thing here), and the service is pleasant and quick.  I'm sure I'll be back.~~#~0
My boyfriend told me that the sushi we had was the best he has ever had there and that we must have hit it on an ON night. We had the avocado suhsi and that INCREDIBLE... the california rolls were just so so. The people there were the most ridiculous part and made me feel as though we should have been heading to a frat party after our "date".~~#~0
I'd give this place 3.5 stars.  Its a little corner bar, good food, reasonable beer prices, seems like the kind of place a lot of regulars would belly up to the bar.  They have a lot of flatscreens around the bar.  The environment though is pretty drab and dark.  Needs to be redone really, its almost depressing in there.~~#~0
After a couple of frustrating days, my problem with DaVinci Green has been resolved.  I have decided to keep them on for granite counters and I hope to be able to give them 5 stars after the work.  Bottom line, they did step up and do what they could to satisfy me.~~#~0
Finally got around to checking out this place.  The building is new and modernized, placed on a large lot that was once a burger king.  While there is ample parking, it is located along a very busy stretch of Thomas road which makes it a bit of a challenge to get into.  My student-driver daughter ended up pulling practically around the block to get in here.  An experienced driver would still have difficulty.  Once inside, the dining-room is open and airy, with an industrial modern appearance.  Everything was clean and shiny.  We decided to order the "Caniac" ($8.69) so we could both share.  This meal comes with six crispy chicken tenders, two containers of "cane sauce", a small cup of cole slaw, Texas Toast, a huge heap of Crinkle-cut fries, and a large drink .  It took about 5 minutes to get our order, I guess because they make it fresh to order.  At least the chicken part - which was the best part of the meal.  While waiting, I wandered over to the drink bar which has the usual carbonated-sugar drinks and both sweetened and unsweetened tea.  I chose the unsweetened iced tea which was fresh, but weak, almost overpowered by the tap-water taste.  Three suggestions here - filter your water, brew your tea stronger and provide lemon slices/quarters to go with it.  Especially this time of year when you practically cannot give away lemons (at least in my neighborhood).  Eventually, our food arrived, packed in your typical square , partitioned styro.  As I said the chicken was the best part of the meal, but that is relative.  the cole slaw was uninspiring, just like any cole slaw served at another well-known fast-food chicken place.  Not bad, but not different.  The Crinkle-cut fries could be so much better if they were fried fresh and crispy, instead, ours were cooked appropriately, not very salty at all,  yet limp , indicating they've been sitting around a while.  The cane sauce is their special recipe, but it too didn't elicit any feelings of "I gotta get me some of that".  The Texas Toast is something I wonder about.  To me it tasted stale, but that may have been simply the artifical sweetener in the bread recipe.  I think that it is somewhat superfluous to the meal, more or less just a filler.  If you are going to do something like this, you gotta make sure the bread has some flavor or crispness to compliment the dish or you are simply providing filler for the waste can.  Finally, the chicken.  It was juicy, tender and the pieces were large enough to be substantial.  The coating was crispy but lacked much discernable flavor, beyond the browned taste of coating.  I think it would have benefitted from a bit more seasoning, at least some salt.  Considering that this is fast food, it wasn't bad overall, but I'm not sure I'll be returning anytime soon.~~#~0
My wife wanted to eat something spicy for lunch, so she said let's hit some local Thai.  We had never eaten Thai in the East Valley, so we went onto Yelp and read some of the reviews.  This restaurant is very close to my office, so we decided to give it a shot.Service was so-so, but it was a lunch crowd, so I think they were doing the best they could.  Our order was taken after a bit of delay, but our food came out in decent time afterward.  We both had Pad Thai noodles on the lunch menu, which came with a small soup, some fried wonton skins, and an egg roll.  Have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  The noodles were exceedingly tasty.  We set the heat at "medium" but probably should've bumped it up a tad.  However, at medium it allowed us to savor the flavor.For the two of us, the bill was $15 (we had water), so it was extremely inexpensive, and there was plenty of food.  Quite happy, we will definitely eat here again.~~#~0
---- Update ----Okay so me and a buddy went back to Pirate's yesterday and I have to say, I am saddened.  They have changed suppliers, and now the versions of their items are horrible.  The shrimp are just regular frozen jumbo shrimp, not the big globs of battered goodness as before.  Their scallops are about as big as my thumbnail and they looked horrible.  The fish is a square processed patty and the fries are skinny and cheap.They even hired a second employee.  A lady who is not only rude, but smug while she is laying into you about how the tartar sauce doesn't come with your fish.  NO TARTAR SAUCE?!?!?! Its a fish and chips place!!!! In the end, we had to 'trade' (YES I SAID TRADE!) our Pete's, oops i mean Pirate's sauce for tartar sauce!  WHAT A JIP!I am removing a star for this horrendous "make over". Because hey, if you're gonna change something, change the damn tables!---- First Review ----What can I say about Pirates Fish and Chips?  Well there are some good things and bad things (mostly good).  You could EASILY compare this to any number of fish and chip 'shacks' around the Phoenix valley, but this one definitely stands out.  It stands out mostly because of its cleanliness (compared to other shacks) and the food itself.  I have been to the location on Warner and Gilbert twice now and both times it was clean, and the service was fast.  Everything on the menu is frozen, mind you, but it comes in large portions.  The service is great, they will actually bring it out to you even if you are sitting outside!  The food has been super hot (almost too hot) both times, so be careful when biting into those delicious crabby patties!On the downside, the plastic tables are an eyesore, and should be wiped down more often.  They really don't fit well with the decor (Mural, flatscreens, etc..) and I wouldn't bring anyone to this place to impress them (solely because of the tables)~~#~0
Breakfast anytime ... and it's hard to mess up breakfast. It's a step up from franchise fast food (McDonald's, Burger King, etc.) on the road but not what I'd call a giant step. The big difference is that you get to sit down while they take your order (as opposed to standing in line at a counter). The coffee is OK but not what I'd call gourmet. Service is friendly and helpful.~~#~0
i am a vegetarian with vegan tendencies and i stopped here without knowing anything about it at the whim of a couple mates either to or from the hark a while back. i had been craving a burger, and so the pita jungle was a very lucky find. the burger was a bit dry, but i would eat here again due to how vegetarian-friendly the menu is; if you are vegan, you can find out what is vegan from their site (or just look up 'pita jungle vegan' via your search engine of choice).the hummus lasted for a while after i took it home (a week or two?). their hummus is très savoureux, and our waiter (?) was more than happy to give us a sampling of all three types- i recommend asking for extra pita.~~#~0
Simply ok. Their Italian Beef isn't bad but its not great either. Had more flavors than Lobbys but their hot peppers are weird (there is cucumber in the mixture?!?) and the bread does not hold up to the jus. I ordered an Italian beef not dipped, yet the bread was super soggy from just the meat jus. Additionally, I like grilled onion on my Italian Beef and that was not even an option on the menu. Even though i think Taylor Street is better, I would come here again because its closer and the hubby says he doesn't mind it.~~#~0
I love Pho. I love mekong plaza and its potential. Anyway- unPhogettable is a nice place to spend your Saturday after stocking up on Asian groceries. What I like about this place is how personable and amazingly friendly the wait staff are. Service was impeccable. The pho was great- me, my sisters and grandma got a variation of different noodle dishes. We did one with seafood, one with tendon, and one with rare flank steak. We also ordered thai iced tea and vietnamese coffee. All of those were good, but not the best. One thing that I didn't like very well were the fresh spring rolls. I am used to the pho places in Atlanta serving fresh spring rolls with mint inside, and with bigger pieces of shrimp and meat. So overall- food was okay, but service was amazing.~~#~0
Service - 3 stars. A bit of a long wait to order, but otherwise pretty good. Waiter was not overly attentive. Food - 4 stars. Well cooked tuna, beef steaks and lobster tails. Atmosphere - 4 stars. Great decor, crowd, music. Value for $ - 2 1/2 stars. Portions are small and about 25% higher than what they should be.~~#~0
This place is the definition of OK. Not great and not bad either. Good for a family, but not really a date place. If you want something hot, quick, low key and moderately tastey, then this is the place for you.~~#~0
I've had to travel through Phoenix a couple times recently because I was stupid enough to fly on US Air.Cons:1. It's huge and it seems like it takes forever to get from point A to B, which can be annoying when US Air cancels your flight and you're running around trying to find a way to get back to Seattle.2. I swear there are US Air employees hawking credit cards like every 10 feet.  It gets annoying.Pros:1. There is this place called the Blue Burrito Grill and it kicks the butt of all other airport food.  They're super fast and we had an amazingly good chicken burrito there last time.~~#~0
Brands: Not so many high-end brands then I thought there would be. A great majority of the clothes are from Kohl's and Target. Shoes from Shoedazzle and other non-department stores.Pricing: The prices are average to pricey for a consignment store. Age: I would definitely have to say that the clothes are NOT geared towards a younger demographic (40+).Customer Service: The customer service is not the greatest. They ignore customers as they come in. Consigning: 40% off of a purchase ONLY if something is sold. This probably has to be the worst deal for consigning in the valley.~~#~0
Went there for a few drinks and met up with my boyfriend and his best friend. Standing at the bar was actually more fun than being like every other lazy person there that 'had' to sit down. The noise level was okay, we did have to do a wee bit of shouting at one point. But hey, it's a bar! The female bartender was kind of slow and seemed a bit too into herself rather than taking care of guests at the bar. However, there was one guy behind the bar that made the end of our experience kind of fun. He was personable and funny. Cannot for the life of me remember his name. Thin build w/blonde hair. Said he was married I think? Anyway, kuddos to that guy! He was great!~~#~0
Az omelette, hash, pancakes all delicious. Food makes up for subpar interior but what do you expect from a "mom and pop" operation. They at least tried, but who cares the food was great.~~#~0
Like others have said, its just like Chipotle.  Jack In The Box's version of Chipotle (which used to be a McDonalds company).  Someone could give me a chicken burrito made the same way at both, and I probably would not know the difference.  Chipotle's chicken has a little bit more spice, but other than that I can't see much of a difference.They do have slightly more variety than Chipotle does in terms of the entree's you can get.  I see no point to drive out of my way to go to a Qdoba, when there are like 5 times as many Chipotle's around.~~#~0
I'm adding one star to my old review. A pair of my FAVORITE sunglasses broke the other week and I got them years ago so I knew it would be impossible to replace them. I knew I would be coming to Scottsdale Fashion and I remembered seeing a pair of shades very similar to mine in a magazine that were H&M brand. I came in and found them right away, and for $10 they are a steal. They feel very sturdy and honestly I almost like them more than my other pair that broke! I did see a long line for the dressing room again so it looks like they haven't fixed their technique on that, but I wasn't in there to buy clothes so it didn't matter to me.Thanks for the hot sunglasses, maybe I will come here for accessories only!~~#~0
Soup is my pleasure food! With that being said, the rest of the family loves their sandwiches!This particular one is closet to our home.So if we eat at Paradise this is the one we go to. The cleanliness of the store is good. Tables are always clean and kept up. Bathroom is clean and stocked.  Soup is normally good, unfortunately the bread bowls leave a lot to be desired :(Two out of three times the bread is stale.Sandwiches are good, Mac and Cheese is wonderful!~~#~0
Went here for Father's Day with my sister and dad to go see the new X-Men movie. I had never been before and had wanted a little something extra to make the movie a special experience. The downside is that it was a bit of a hike from where I live (many other theaters closer), but the great thing is that a matinee movie in a fancy theater like this is the same price as a normal theater.The seats were comfortable, there is seat side order service by the press of a button, and any seat is a good seat. The down side is they only have seats in pairs of 2. Purchasing the ticket online was kind of tricky to and it didn't show where our seats were so the ticket attendant (after sending us to the theater) had to run down and find our seats.~~#~0
Went there on Friday for lunch. The place was packed. And noisy.Stepped in and a young girl with shorts and flimsy t-shirt asked me "how many"? I was shocked to find she worked here. I would be ashamed to go out in public dressed like that. Sat at the bar since it was so crowded. Service there was good. Wait staff coming through was attractive and dressed nice. Good selection of beverages at the bar. I ordered the Honey Chicken Pizza, it was pretty good. Not over flavorful but decent. It was cut into 8 pieces and I could only manage to get 3 of them down, and brought the rest home. I would go back again. They must do something about the acoustics there though.~~#~0
While searching for a place for some drinks and appetizers in Scottsdale the other night, some friends and I decided to pay Loco Patron a visit mostly due to their spacious outdoor seating. In all, while not the best experience, the time was enjoyable.Star 1 - How was the service and atmosphere?After seating ourselves, my party was promptly met by a friendly server who brought out our drinks before taking our orders for several platters of appetizers.  Outside of being just the right amount of attentive, the atmosphere at Loco Patron was comfortable, with a diverse crowd of 30-somethings and a friendly vibe. Star Granted.Star 2 - How were the portions relative to the cost?Admittedly, and possibly for the first time ever, I didn't keep track of the costs of our drinks and appetizers, but we did take advantage of the Happy Hour menu that consisted of fried goodies and decent drink specials.  At the end of the day, after ordering a huge plate of nachos, smashed potatoes, hot wings, a quesadilla, roughly six (weak) margaritas and four beers, our final tab for our party of six was roughly $125 after tax and tip. While I suppose $21 is a bit steep for a sampling or two of each of the appetizers and two drinks each, it wasn't unreasonable. Star Granted.Stars 3/4 - How was the food?While I can't speak for the normal menu, Loco Patron's Happy Hour menu was satisfying, and particular compliments go out to the hot wings and the generous portion of nachos. As is common, this isn't anything fancy, but if you're looking for a quick appetizer, Loco isn't a bad option. Single Star Granted.Star 5 - Would you eat it every day if you could?Would I come back again? Sure, especially since Loco Patron is very accommodating for larger crowds; however, with so many options in the area, I can't say I'd make Loco Patron a regular spot. No Star Granted.~~#~0
Bev Mo is a great place to pick up most of your alcohol needs. Why only three stars?  With the idea of an inclusive liquor store, I had hoped it would be easy to find a few of my favorites. I've tried to find some guatemalan beer and some miller chill in cans and have so far been unsuccessful.  I have however looked up the miller chills on their website and they are there!  None of the guatemalan..  I also looked for tripel karmeleit but not there.Aside from that, it has pretty much whatever you need.  There is an impressive selection of bottled soda.  I am looking forward to going  back just for that reason.  And to brows through some wine and beer.~~#~0
At first I thought oOoh sushi and seafood buffet! Yay to all you can eat sushi and seafood for the cheap price of $15.88 ....then when I went to get my food - I took a look at the sushi station - hmMmM  it's a Wednesday night and not very busy...those rolls and sashimi looks like they've been out on the plate for a while.....ehhh maybe it won't be too bad....so I decided to get just a few salmon and mackeral sashimi and one - what looks like a yellowtail handroll.However, they have a pretty good selection of other foods - the seafood section had crawfish, king crab legs, fried crab, shrimp, periwinkle, scallop salad on the shell and cooked salmon....I tried a little of each and besides the periwinkle, the other is pretty good. The sushi/sashimi I had, however was not so good -- the salmon sashimi was warm, so was the mackeral sashimi, and the one hand roll I had was not really edible - it was chewy and I was a bit afraid to eat the fish cause it didn't seem so fresh after all. So I steered clear of the raw stuff - especially when it's not a busy lunch/dinner time and when it looks like they have been sitting there for awhile - I think the problem was that they didn't put ice underneath the plates that served the sashimi and the lights above it really warmed it up. The other food sections they had were meats - bbq pork, short ribs (good taste but chewy), roasted duck, sausages, korean bbq ribs, teriyaki chicken and some grilled octopus and zucchini. and some other food sections you'll see normally at this type of Asian buffet. As I walked around I noticed that they had a whole fridge of Dryers Ice Cream - 6 different flavors of ice cream...not that soft frozen yogurt stuff they have at most buffets...now I was looking forward to dessert! hehe The dessert section was fancy too - they had chocolate cake, strawberry cake, flan, angel cake and cookies but none tickled my taste buds like the cookies n cream and mint chocolate chip ice cream I had. ;) Overall this place was, to my surprise, not bad at all.....for $16 bucks I had a pretty satisfying meal. the service was nice - gave me a refill on my drink before I even finished my first one...and was quick to clear out the plates.~~#~0
Being from CA I learned about the rich and diverse history of AZ.  There are many excellent displays in the chronological walk through self-guided tour.  I was disappointed with the sparse coverage of the native american story and other finer details of other ethnic groups. There are some efforts throughout but I am left feeling like it is a history told from the conquerors. I think this perpetuates ignorance.  Because of this I feel compelled to give less stars because of this but I do think it is worthy of your $5 and time.~~#~0
Cyclo is like the cooler, hip younger sister restaurant of Khai Hoan in Tempe (They are literally sister restaurants, as stated on their menu).  It exudes the exuberance of youth, but doesn't quite capture the authenticity and depth of menu that Khai Hoan does.  The interior is similar to a funky little boba shop, with lots of bright, pop-star colors and design, and those that are unfamiliar with Vietnamese cuisine may find this as a good stepping stone.  The menu is very limited, and portions are smaller than Khai Hoan, albeit more fancifully decorated with flair.  Prices are also higher.  The papaya salad I had was good, and had a good balance of tangy, spicy, and sweet.  My husband's mixed grill entree was decent, but the strips of meat were slightly overcooked so they tasted tough.Justine, the owner, was here and she is charming, vibrant, and always has a funny story to tell.  I do give her props for creating a more welcoming atmosphere for those that are usually afraid to try different foods, but for me, I'll probably head to Khai Hoan for my Vietnamese fix.~~#~0
Darn good coffee tucked away in an unassuming location near ASU. Off beat vibe, kind of like somewhere that is trying to give the Seattle or more hippie Portland vibe to you in AZ. The drinks were solid, but not amazing. I had a better experience the times I went to Cartel in downtown PHX so I expected a little more here. Still, probably the best place in Tempe to come for a real handcrafted espresso beverage. And I can imagine if you were looking for study spots in the area, have the requisite Macbook, and want t be a cool hipster kid, this is as good of a place as any to plug. In and work on that term paper. But be warned, it gets busy and seating is limited.It's 3.5 for sure, but I don't round up for them because they weren't very friendly either time I was here...and that bugged. Especially when I tried to talk to them about their espresso machine. They recently upgraded from a Synesso to a LaMarzocco Strada (OH MY GOD) - and that deserves discussion.Also note, no big signs...just a smallish sign that says "Cartel Coffee Lab." Easy to miss. Come check 'em out of you're over in Tempe, otherwise try the downtown location.~~#~0
Nice people.  I'm not crazy about being served pre-prepared food that's not "slamming".  It was just ok for me.  I would go back for a group lunch or something, but the suggestion would not come from me.~~#~0
Stopping in for happy hour drinks and apps.  Great patio, service as so-so.  Would return for happy hour, but menu was not appealing enough to come back for dinner.~~#~0
Fast service on our order...we called ahead and it was ready to go when we got there 5 minutes later. Free wifi. while you wait. Got the salad with chicken on top and onion rings. **Krunchy** onion rings!~~#~0
This place was recommended by shaking up UrbanSpoon on my iPhone. The goods...super fast service...lots of salsa (both hot and mild) is provided and the tortilla chips were delivered warm.  Iced tea tasted fresh.  The glass was refilled quickly (I sat at the bar).  Very cool building, the blue windows are very cool, looks like a spaceship.  I order a chicken chimi, which was decent.  It was delivered so quick, I didn't think it was possible to fry up a chimi so quick.The not so goods...The chimi had a bit more tortilla than I usually like.  The mild salsa wasn't bad, but wasn't great.  It was a bit pricy for a lunch stop (for me anyways), not the best value.I'd go again, but only if I was in the area.~~#~0
Been here a few times. I usually get the tacos, (hey it's in the name), but this last time I got taquitos. They pretty good, albeit small. I also asked for no onions or tomatoes in the gauc, and they came with it anyway, but whatever.~~#~0
The coffee here is incredible, as are the vegan goodies, but the service is so slow and sometimes there aren't even vegan goodies!  It's kind of a drive for me to go there, so I always call ahead to see if they have treats for me, but answering doesn't seem like a priority for the people who work here.  Slow service would be fine if they had vegan chocolate chips, but I am not taking the gamble again, its not worth a 15 minute drive for a toddy.  I will make one here at my house.  I will continue to try and call, and if they one day miraculously break away from their ping pong games (seriously I heard a barista use this excuse for why the customer waited 5 minutes at an unattended bar) to answer the phone and tell me that they have something more to offer than a toddy, then I will go back.  Until then, find me at Lux or the new Cartel.  They don't have vegan goodies either, but the service is fantastic.  I know you guys are "conspiring" or whatever, but it's a business, and brand equity matters.  Your competition is thick and you provide a service that is an easy "skip" in tough financial times.  Might want to step your game up.  Being nice isn't quite good enough.~~#~0
When they said it was the White House, they weren't kidding! white walls, white lights, white balloons and apparently the evening we went alot of people were wearing white. My friend Dani mentioned that she felt she should have worn white coz she felt that she stood out, lol. I like that there's bars on opposite sides with the dance floor in the middle. and yes, that giant ass disco ball with a midsized raised platform for the ladies to pop lock and drop it. I'm a fan of old town clubs that are not really the scottsdale crowd. I'd say this was like a dressed up mill ave crowd that's partying in scottsdale. Nothing wrong with that. I like the fact that there's no cover, and plenty of tables, chairs and couches. Downside is the patio where you can't bring your drink but I understand why coz it's not really an actual patio, it's like a makeshift patio that's set up on certain evenings. I now understand the whole ladder thing and the dj. I mean wow... the dj booth above the entrance with the ladder. It's cool and all but maybe they should have designed it like the dj booth at az88. my complaint with this dj is that altho he had an ok mix it just annoyed me that he wouldn't finish the good songs but rather play the chorus lines, or the song for a minute and then mesh it with a different song. It was sporadic at times, and it didn't seem to flow that well. I do like the electro hip hop tho =)Overall it's a good club on craftsman court. this part of old town is not on the club circuit but I'm glad it offers a different scene other than acme and dos gringos. Good mixed crowd, drink prices typical of old town scottsdale and the tokyo teas are strong! I will be back!~~#~0
I like Arizona Center, but the parking situation leaves much to be desired. I found it confusing, over priced, and inconvenient when I wanted to see a movie. It was raining, I didn't know where to go, or to take my parking ticket to get validated. It ended up okay because my ticket was unreadable so I did not have to end up paying to park after all, but I would have been pretty irritated for $1 every 20 min after a 2+ hr long movie!I also think they could advertise more or something. It's always seemed like a secret. I was taken here by a friend some 7 years ago, but I didn't know my way around down town yet, and I never heard of it again to be reminded of where it was until recently.It has potential, but definitely underutilized. I agree that while its nice to walk around, there isn't enough substance to keep patrons there for a long time.I was also excited about seeing Corner Bakery there, but again, that's not too long of a visit.~~#~0
Maybe my expectations were super high since El Chorro Lodge is like an Arizona institution, but after experiencing a meal at this restaurant, I can't bring myself to give more than three stars.  Don't get me wrong, it was "A-OK," it just didn't blow me away.The history of this place dates back to the 1930's and is pretty amazing.  You can read about it on their website.  The outdoor dining area is huge and has great views of Camelback Mountain.  The live music provides for a nice ambiance as well... at least live music when we were there on a Saturday night.  And our meal got off to a nice start with the relish tray and sticky buns - yum!  But the service was really slow and the food was nothing to write home about.  We found it to be overpriced as well.I'd consider returning to El Chorro for brunch or lunch or drinks or just picking up sticky buns "to go" sometime, but I wouldn't recommend it for dinner.~~#~0
Cool vibe, nice servers, sweet decor, decent (emphasis on decent, not oh-my-god-I-was-totally-blown-away!) food. Not amazing. But worth a trip to see and be seen :) Sit at the bar and it will make you feel hip.~~#~0
Where's the beef...?I used to like Wendys. It was my go to for fast food. Everything just seems to be ok now. Nothing jumps out to remind me to eat here again. 1/4lb burger (before cooking) is now the size of a small JR burger and the JR burgers might as well be vegan. Seriously there was a spot on the bun where the meat should be. LOLThe Chili was great, the side salads were good. I think I am over fast food.~~#~0
I have been to many mediterranean restaurants and this place is below average.  Chicken was dry and the bread was not fresh.  This would have gotten much a much better review if I hadn't been to so many other restaurants serving this type of food.~~#~0
A couple of visits now under the belt. The first one I had an Italian beef and it was alright I suppose, but I am hard to please when it comes to this item. On a recent visit for lunch, tried the char cheddar dog. It was nicely charred, the bun was spread with a good amount of the sharp cheddar spread like Merkts which I like. However the bun was not steamed and the cook was a bit over enthusiastic with the celery salt, as a little goes a long way. I also sampled the sliders. Same issue as with the dog, the buns were not steamed whatsoever. The mini burger is certainly priced right but the cheese and condiments were both understated here. Charred burgers are nice I suppose, but not steam grilled like a true slider. Better versions across town. On the plus side lunch was pretty cheap at around ten bucks. I am thinking 2.5 until I get back here and put another taste on this place. One odd thing I found about the service was that receipts had numbers, yet the expediter delivering food to the masses would call out what the items were instead of just calling out a number. Also the dual flat screen monitor menu boards are difficult to read, lots of glare and they change images. Most people I observed picked up a take out paper menu to place their order. Kind of defeats the purpose and made the ease of ordering more difficult and slower than it has to be~~#~0
After passing Grand Lux Cafe about a hundred times, I finally had the chance to check it out. Knowing it was a sibling of Cheesecake Factory, I expected a similar menu. Upon entering, it had the same feeling as a Cheesecake. We sat down and the second the menu opened, realized, the menu was about as detailed as well! From sandwiches, to dishes from every culture imaginable, this restaurant definitely has something for everyone to choose from. As the friendly waiter welcomed us, he told us about the menu and mentioned that Grand Lux focuses on serving different cultural cuisine from pretty much every region around. In one sitting you could try Thai, Chinese, Mexican and Italian. Yet, it wasn't actually as weird as it sounds. It really just depends on what your taste buds are in the mood for. However, the waiter did warn us that portions were large. How large? I was about to find out. With so many options to choose from, I ended up going with the spicy flat bread chicken sandwich full of corn, avocado tomatoes and freshly grilled chicken. We had the chicken lettuce wraps to start. The second my meal arrived, I realized that friendly waiter was definitely not kidding when he said the portions were large. I think my sandwich equaled 2-3 full meals. The sandwich came in quarter flat breads and equaled nearly one full sandwich per each quarter. And they gave me four of them! The french fries heaped on the plate as well. I managed to eat one quarter of the sandwich and felt wasteful for not being able to finish the rest, but my waistline is already in a fight with me and the one quarter completely filled me up. However, when we sat down, friendly waiter mentioned the desserts (we should have just skipped right ahead) and said that they took a half an hour to prepare because they were freshly made. Who can pass up an opportunity to eat freshly made dessert so beignets it was. True to the theme of overly portioned items, they brought out eight (!!) large fist sized beignets steaming hot and oozing with freshly melting powdered sugar. To accompany them, they gave three dipping sauces. Heaven. That's all I can say. It was worth every bite...of the one I had. With six remaining, I wonder who could possible finish eight large beignets unless you are with a group of eight! After visiting Grand Lux, I definitely think more highly of it then I did the hundreds of times I passed it and I would absolutely go back again. But, I know now to listen to the man when he says the portions are big! So I'll just skip right ahead to dessert.~~#~0
I had my hair cut by Jackie yesterday and she was absolutely adorable!  She did an amazing shampoo and condition, a quick and beautiful trim and then took her time blow drying my hair.  The only down side to this place is that it's a little out dated and kinda dirty inside, but the staff was wonderful.~~#~0
I was starving so I gave in and decided to check this place out. Small place, nothing special inside (which really does not bother me) but good service. The hummus was very good and the pita bread tasted very fresh. They do have a very large menu and prices are very decent as well considering the large portions. My entree was meh- like I said I was starving so it did the job. No alcoholic beverages of any sort. Entree did come with either soup or salad (large salad) and either rice or fries. Had the rice and salad which were both alright. I did leave with leftovers but couldn't tell you if it was because i was just too full or my taste buds just weren't really diggin' what I was throwing in there. Heard about it, tried it, don't have it down in my datebook as of now to head back.~~#~0
I've never purchased anything here, but want to briefly note that this is a TERRIFIC place to get rid of things you don't need. Seriously, it couldn't be any easier - just come around back, stop, and some nice guy will come out even in 105 degree weather to unload your stuff, whisk it away, and offer you a receipt for your tax deduction. Easy and pie!Inside, it is a pretty typical Goodwill. This one isn't very clean or orderly, but the people working are friendly. Basically it's a mixture of crap and with some useful stuff and hidden gems throughout. But it's a damn good place to go when you're moving, cleaning out, downsizing, whatever.~~#~0
Airport prices! 2 eggs, toast and potatoes. No drink. $7.65! Very average breakfast for an extremely above average price.~~#~0
Went here Saturday morning...  Was a little hungover and didn't feel like knocking elbows at some of the other breakfast joints around town.  I wanted a nice cozy atmosphere for my breakfast.  Got it!  This place has a very western feel to it..   IE: saw dust on the floor, lots of antiques and western memorabilia all over the place.  Very cute place I'd think to take children if you have them.  The place was quiet and a little dark, which was perfect for me... hehe... (hungover).  Our waitress was super friendly and very good at getting us set up with our meal.  They have traditional breakfasts here around the same price's as Denny's.  Food was good, just had an egg, sausage, and biscuts and gravy... nothing fancy about it.  I've been to this place for lunch and dinner on other occasions and the prices are really good,  but their food is just OK....  nothing sticks out in flavor originality.~~#~0
Great service. Scary bright interior decor.Fries were meh at best.Gyro was good. Creepy man ahead of me in line who kept turning back and giving me his million dollar smile with missing teeth was not helping my appetite.If someone were to say, Hey! I want a gyro, I would more than likely take them here. Good job Niro's!~~#~0
One thing I'll appreciate at any gay bar outside of New York City/LA and occasionally San Francisco...the drinks are cheaper (score!). So, the boys and I, after a VERY unfortunate first attempt at exploring gay phoenix/tempe/scottsdale on a Thursday night, were very happy to run into Amsterdam. Nice decor, lovely outdoor space with the ever so classy tequila bottle lights, and good service. They play good music and the guys are cute...although, I don't think I've EVER seen so much hair product in my life. It's like woman and their chest as they get older and using a bra....I think gay men fear that their hair will start to sag over years of fighting gravity, so they have hair product to give it support (but even I know when a push up bra is pushing up just a little too much)! Also, kind of a negative point...definitely sensed some attitude at this bar. The guys here seem VERY into themselves. Just an observation, take that and do with it what you will. Some helpful tips...on Saturday night, I believe it's no-cover before midnight...they serve plastic cups at the outdoor bar instead of glass (not really a deal breaker, but in case you're curious), and the dance floor is kind of unimpressive.~~#~0
Not good nor bad. Personally inn & out burger is better as well as five guys. I wasn't all that impressed. There is nothin I hate more then eating super dry meat. And that's what this burger was, I don't think I'll go back well maybe to try the ice cream.~~#~0
At-One may be your studio if you're into highly active Vinyasa flow classes. If you're looking for a wide-selection of more gentle, restorative, or even beginner classes, this may not be the studio for you. However Mary Bruce does teach these classes here and is amazing! I've gone through yoga teacher training with her and she's great.Even though I've had good experiences at the studio, and taken classes with a couple great teachers, I've been to a couple classes that left me more than disappointed. The price is just way too high for drop-in classes, I think around $20. That's out of my budget, and I think it's out of most people's budgets. I've noticed At-One attracts those with more disposable income, at least those who come frequently. Also, many of the classes place a huge emphasis on music. It can be hard to go inward when there's so much outward stimulation.The studio is beautiful. I like the rounded corners of the rooms and the nice lighting. You can tell they've really put a lot of thought and effort into making the space gorgeous.~~#~0
This review is primarily for the car was that I use a couple times a month, though I do typically fill up here because I have some weird alliance to Chevron gas...There is a no-touch car wash at this Chevron that is a pretty good deal. It's a 4-5 minute, touchless wash that is only $8 for the top end wash. I think you get a slight discount on gas if you purchase a wash, though the two have never overlapped for me. I always get the $8, top end wash, and it does a good job. You park in a stationary place and the machine moves around you, complete with wheel cleaners and a lot of soaps and rinses. The dryers don't do a great job, so I bring a couple towels with me and park by the vacuums to get the excess water (of which there is a fair amount). Vacuums are $1 in quarters, and gets you a few minutes. Vacuum quality isn't anything to write home about, but it gets the job done.This wash is also right across the street from Chipotle, so it's a great location for a lunch time car wash.~~#~0
This is another place that came from Iowa City that I ate at all the freakin' time in college. This place is like Chipotle but I think this has better ingredients: tastier meat, fresh pressed tortillas, creamier cheese, and a quesadilla option.However, I don't think they captured the magic of the Iowa City versions. I think the owner needs to come and figure out what's going on. I still would rather go here for a burrito than Chipotle.~~#~0
I have been here a lot. They are cheap and on my way home. They have great lunch specials. It's not the nicest of places but it's more of one of those places you go to get food and take home. In a old taco bell location this place is very small inside. It is family run and the owners are always there working and cooking. I like supporting local family businesses and I will continue to eat here. The Chow fun noodles are my favorite and you can't go wrong with beef with broccoli.~~#~0
I'm reluctant to give this 3.  More of a 2.5.   Me and the lady friend had an awful time / experience here.  First, and this is a big warning to anyone driving in, there is only ONE WAY into the stadium, and that's on Camelback Road.  Between the freeway off ramps, waiting on Camelback road and confusing parking, we lost an hour + of our lives, and we missed the first inning.  I hate missing all the hoop-la (even in Spring Training) before the game starts...  I will say we went to a night game & rush hour didn't help!Anyway, once you park, it's a long walk through the practice grounds to get to the stadium.Once you are inside, things got a bit better.  I woofed down a dodger dog, a staple of Dodger food in L.A. - a footlong dog with yellow mustard, but the beer selection stunk!  The dodgers share this stadium with the Chicago White Sox, and between the two, there were no local micro beers or even any good ones from anywhere else.  There was even a "special beer area" on the program, but it was sponsored by Budweiser.  No thanks.The outfield doesn't feel like there is a lot of room for fans, but at least the fans that packed the stadium were into it.  Dodger fans are all about their team, and it was energizing to be around people watch the game because they love it.We did walk around, and the building itself is amazing.  But, architecture will never trump experience at a ball game.Final note - I was born a Cubs fan.  I might be a little bias about anything the White Sox play in...* This spring training, I took on an aggressive goal.  Go to all 10 Spring Training Parks & see all 15 teams in one spring training season, and do it all on the weekends (FRI-SUN).  This review is a part of 10 total reviews.~~#~0
If you have an itchin for some mexican food and are close, this place will do the trick. We usually stop in on a sunday morning for some menudo, ask for extra corn as they usually load up the meat, get there early for breakfast because its not too big and not many places around so it gets busy fast....~~#~0
i've eaten at several pei wei restaurants -- which are all about the same -- but i've chosen to review this one, because it's special for a couple of reasons:- it's closest to my home- it was after a lunch meal here that i decided i would be plenty happy if i never eat at pei wei againthis is my fifth review on yelp, and it's my first review of a chain.  there's a good reason for that -- i spend much more time and money at mom and pop stores than chains.there's nothing wrong with pei wei -- but there's nothing really right about it either.  the recipes are solid, but the ingredients are average.  the service is acceptable, but you know nobody really cares.  the decor is cool at first glance, but it lacks depth and character.all of the pei wei pieces are right, but when you put it all together you still end up with an impersonal chain restaurant that's nothing more than a series of business decisions, by committee.ok.  with that said...if you've never been to pei wei, you should probably give it a try.  i'm no fan of chains, but these guys pull it off much better than most other cookie-cutter eateries. you'll probably enjoy at least your first 1/2 dozen or so experiences. the lettuce wraps, spicy korean, and blazing noodles used to be favorites of mine.so there's another reason why i picked this location to review...it's also right next to Tott's, which is everything i imagine pei wei would be if it wasn't a huge corporation, was run by a hand-picked staff, and was paying someone's mortgage.  it's an excellent example of why privately owned, mom and pop, and smaller, can be so much better.  just try the bourbon chicken there and see if you ever go back to pei wei...~~#~0
7/22/11Came in to redeem my complimentary birthday drink- chose a large Very Berry Refresher, a green coffee-based black raspberry drink rehydrated from a mix.  I enjoyed it very much, but I doubt I'll order it again, now that I know it's a rehydrated mix drink...  Service was very friendly, and the two women there were very patient w/ my questions about the new Refreshers.  I appreciate the free birthday drink, and I will continue to come here once in awhile for hot or iced black coffees!  :)~~#~0
150 whiskeys on the menu, nice quiet patio, attractive servers, very chill spot.  Burgers are their specialty and everyone at the table raved about them.  I was impressed with the knowledge of the menu from the staff.  One thing that I didn't really like was how the bill was kind of confusing.  There was a gratuity % charge and a service charge?  It was like the tip was already taken out I think?  Several people ask about this the server mentioned.~~#~0
The food was very good, well prepared. The servers are a bunch of college kids who like their jobs - they constantly push the hot sauce! Atmosphere was like a dinner, a nice casual place to eat good Thai food. I'm going back!~~#~0
Dos Gringos is rarely a planned destination.  Usually, it's an accident.  Sometimes I have a lot of fun and sometimes I have a drink and leave.  I went there again this past weekend and again it was an unplanned stop.  My friend wanted to go next door to BS West and after some guy spilled a drink down my entire back, I decided to go over to Dos where at least I wasn't wasting my outfit on men who would rather critique it than rip it off (note: that sentence sounds way sluttier than I am, so don't get all excited).  It's almost my birthday, so the bartender made me some sort of shot in a plunger.  Classy all the way.  Also, there were a bunch of Slutty Santas to help give the place a festive feel. Now, I am going to give you ladies a tip about Dos Gringos.  Don't expect to meet any quality men here.  For example, I met this hot Croatian guy on my last visit.  We had a lot of fun until I discovered his friend was actually his girlfriend.  Don't you just love it when guys refer to their girlfriends as just friends, but then the girlfriend reveals that they're dating and you stand there looking like an idiot and try to find a polite way to exit.  Well, I sure do.  What's up with that?  Talk about uncomfortable.  I am starting to become convinced that only guys who are looking to cheat on their girlfriends go to this bar... that or I only attract men with girlfriends.  Either way, please stop hitting on me taken and/or married men.  Thanks.~~#~0
My boyfriend and I came here for restaurant week this year hoping to try some of the fine dining in Arizona. This place is quite fancy! It has the dim lights, cloth napkins, the whole cute dinner date ambiance where you feel you can only speak in little more than a whisper. The waiter was very friendly, helpful, and service was excellent.I can't exactly remember the food except for the fact that everything was very very salty! I'm a person that can handle my salt and even I thought it was too salty! I was so surprised because of the great reviews this place has gotten and the overall environment. Maybe it was a bad night or something but it was so salty I drank about 5 glasses of water!~~#~0
This is a no frills delicious place to get some quick mexican food. The food authentic and fresh and I have never diliked anything i have gotten there. You can't go wrong. The salsa bar is only okay and i am a salsa whore so this but this is probably a big point for a great mexican place.~~#~0
Solid 3 stars. Very casual. Salsa not very good. Rice good. Chimi average. pollo con quesa not bad, better than chimi. Overall your average  American-Mexican restaurant.~~#~0
This is a great place to eat "except" they are hit and miss with food quality and level of service. On occasion when my wife and I stop on for lunch, there always manages to be some issue with the food in one another's meal. Given there are 2 of us? That translates to them hitting the mark 50% of the time. The menu selection is awesome. The dark molasses indian bread with butter is worth the trip and if you can get a great service, try the appetiser salad of pecan, endive and blue cheese. The take out cheese cake cant be beat.~~#~0
I went here the other night for the first time when I was near the mall, hungry, and wanted to try a new place. My boyfriend got the club sandwich (delicious) and I got the chicken philly melt (not so delicious). I got a soft serve cone while I was waiting (a tiny one, no judging!)The boy had a brownie for dessert, which he said was delicious.So overall:Yay! Club sandwichBoo! Chicken Philly Wrap thingYummy! soft serve and brownieOh and our sandwiches came with pickles, which were also tasty. :)I'd probably try it again but get a different sandwich.~~#~0
Pizza for breakfast! Hooray!Guy at the counter was very friendly. A nice thing to see when you're on an early morning layover.Had a Margherita... it wasn't the usual CPK quality, but it was TONS better than any other pizza that you can usually get at the airport.I won't say that this is definitely where I'd eat if I were at PHX again, but I wouldn't rule it out.~~#~0
Ok maki, but everything else kinda sucked.  Went about 1 to have the lunch specials with my hubby.The good: The rolls were great, like I said. The tempura, not bad.The not-good:Spicy tuna rolls were not tasty and a little warm.Salad in the bento box was crap.Edamame was not warm or appetizing.Spicy chicken may not have been chicken and was not very spicy either.My vote, skip it.~~#~0
A wise man once told me, "Don't teach the 'gwei lo' new tricks."  I never understood what that meant until I ate here.~~#~0
This place was a nice hotel.  It wasn't as nice as the Hyatt in Albuquerque, but that's not a knock at all.  The atrium was nice, and the location was great.  Everything was close by.  I got it for $60 through Priceline, so the price was solid.  Again, I was given a high floor, which was very nice.  Phoenix has an amazing skyline, and it was really nice to have it.  My only real complaint with the hotel is that the elevators sucked.  They had 5 elevators - but it seemed like only 1 was working at a time.  Everytime I needed one, it was at least a 3 minute wait (not long, but come on - 5 elevators at non busy times!).~~#~0
me:  "Do you have Arrogant Bastard?"him: * blank stare * then, thinking...me:  "Any other micro-brew type beers in a big bottle?"him: "Oh, a bomber? We have Fat Tire, Guiness, Heinekein, (yada yada)...me:  "Great, I'll have the Fat Tire."him:  "That'll be $3.50"This was the actual conversation today at the LIQUOR STORE across from The Vig on 40th St. and Indian School.  I've been meaning to go there and today was the perfect day since the Jeep's thermostat read 97 F today.  The Drive-Thru is the bomb, perfect for a quick beer in a brown bag.  Normally, I skip the bag. You could always go in and shop around, they have Liquor, Beer and Wine.  Arrogant Bastard is a great beer.  I love it when any product starts off the description by telling you that you're probably not going to like it....~~#~0
After reading all the reviews bought a Groupon anyways, I'm willing to give a place a try to form my own opinion. It wasn't over-the-top awesome but it wasn't awful either. Our drinks and food arrived in a timely manner, though the waiter did seem to be a bit of a space cadet. We had 2 cheeseburgers and the ostrich burger, everyone ate up with no complaint. Won't go out of my way to eat here but wouldn't avoid it either.~~#~0
5 nights recently for IAAO Conference.Hotel is new and rooms are excellent.  Front desk staff was very nice and helpful and was able to check us all in 7 hrs early!!!Gym is great, but I only used the 100ft lap pool which was excellent and salt water. $13 a day for wifi has to end!! (free in lobby area)~~#~0
Yeah, this place is a total dive and I wouldn't want to be there during certain times of day but it does have a few gems in spite of being dead. I like it. I go. But only for certain thing.~~#~0
Matt's is pretty good breakfast. I am glad that when I went we had no wait whatsoever. Not sure how we pulled that off on a beautiful Sunday morning...happy though!Definitely overrated. No question there. However there is a certain extreme eating quality to eating at a place smaller than my living room with other guests. I might go back if i spy the line is nonexistent, otherwise...there are other places down the block that are better and you can walk right in and eat!~~#~0
Went for breakfast and everyone around us was sending back the food because it was not hot. I had the Lox and bagels which was good but it seemed not a lot of people enjoyed their food. But good prices and decent food.~~#~0
Great price for the lunch buffet......The food itself tastes good.....The selection is not what we expected.....they have to much "americanized" foods......If i am hungry for Asian food then that is what i want and expect....The staff, although friendly, need to work on visiting the tables a bit more......~~#~0
Lux is SO bi-polar. Half the time the music is unbearable- industrial and LOUD and the service is little more than a grunt from the guy taking your order and your money. The other half of the time the music is Jazz and very conducive to drinking coffee and talking and seemingly more appropriate for the environment. Every once in a while there will be a semi-friendly face at the register, but not very often, in fact it is rare- I once made the mistake of ordering a small drink and they snarled at me that they "only pull double shots" which I had read only moments earlier on the menu but had already forgotten (mommy brain) but they definitely could have handled that a little more nicely. They have books and other kid entertainment so I know they WANT to be kid friendly but the loud industrial music has got to go. The coffee is good and the environment is cool. The pastries are heavenly. I would have only given them 2 stars but the owners are pretty cool and I have hope that they will become more consistent with the music and service. I haven't been there in  a while, mainly for fear of a bad experience but I will give it another chance. I hope they become less focused on being "cool" and more focused on giving customers a genuinely well rounded- good experience.~~#~0
2.5 stars.  Wok-Fired Chicken and Lettuce Wrap was really good, but everything else was blah.  Artichoke dip was like melted american cheese.  Chicken marsala was dry and didn't have a simple marsala sauce (not a good choice on my part, but I figured it's a simple dish, so would be a safe item.  Lesson learned!)  Not sure what we had for dessert, but it was a small scoop of ice cream buried in a ton of whipped cream.  Loud.  Server was good about refilling water.~~#~0
I'm back in AZ again this week and just had some pretty dang good pizza. 12 of us filtered into this place and they handled that pretty well. you order at the counter, prices are decent, calzones are gigantic, the pizza was huge, and my sandwich was good. the beer was flowing like wine. i'm sleepyand boring~~#~0
12/10/09Attended Yelp Office Hour here today.  Had the latte w/ a few chocolate chip cookies that Sarah G. had made.  Lovely space (and delicious latte)!  I'd give 4 stars if the coffee was served at the table, but for now only 3.  I like the nice furniture, both at the dining area and the working lounge.  I hope to be back soon to have another latte (and a pretty one, at that!), catch up on writing Yelp reviews, and just hang out!~~#~0
This place would fit right into Scottsdale with its upscale looking decor.  Decent lunch options, although the lack of a broiled mackerel option is a little annoying (it's one of my favorites).  The fish was ok.  Decent for the desert, but nothing I can't find at a better price at a place with a little less ambition.~~#~0
Sports Chalet seems to have a better selection of gear than the typical Sports Authority when it comes to specialty areas like diving, camping, climbing or hiking gear (except boots). It's worth checking if I need something quickly and don't have time to order on-line or trek out to REI in PV. Prices tend to run to high... especially on some clothing lines. That said, I've seen some good sale/markdown prices on occasion (recently on larger Camelbaks like the Cloudwalker). If you just need the basics, go to the Big 5 sports behind this store near Golds Gym or the Super Walmart up the street... you'll save $$.~~#~0
The constant up sells are a bit annoying, but to an extent I expect it. They didn't honor my $5 eValpak coupon because it wasn't printed (which wasn't stated on the coupon), but after pointing out that they give away $4 coupons after every wash anyway, I was given a $4 discount. I've learned to check the details that I have asked for such as resetting the oil meter after an oil change and vacuuming the trunk, but it's corrected if I point it out.There can be some good deals of getting a free car wash with an oil change, but beware of the up sells and be knowledgeable about the appropriate items that need replacing and when and you should be fine.~~#~0
I love that you are always there for me, all hours of the night, less than a mile from my home. I always get the bean and cheese burrito with extra cheese. I am no thrill seeker here. I really really dislike just about all Mexican food, but the bean and cheese stays close to my heart. I get bean and cheese burritos every time my husband drags me to one of these shady little Mexican establishments, and I would say that Filibertos does not do it best. This particular location is one of the biggest I have seen, but still a little too sketch for me to sit and eat there. Also, the drive thru takes FOREVER. Just run in - it will be much faster. Good burritos, and I will always be back for you, Filis!~~#~0
I took my girlfriend to see "Young Frankenstein" at Gammage last night. Great show, by the way. It's the first time I stepped foot in the place in years, and it's the best spot in the valley to catch a production of any popular traveling show. Having said that, it's actually the only real place where you can see a show like this in the valley, and unfortunately, Gammage would be considered a poor auditorium if it was in a city like New York or Chicago.Parking was good and easy (especially considering you're on ASU's campus). I had no problems getting in or out. But like a previous reviewer mentioned, Gammage could use some renovations inside. It's been unchanged since I was an undergrad at ASU.  It felt old back then, and not in that classical way. Although I do like how roomy the aisles are. You don't have to get up every time someone passes you to get to their seats. Some of the acoustics were pretty bad, too. There was one performer that I had trouble understanding from time to time during the show. Gammage has a really strong lineup every season. It would be nice if some shows would stick around longer than they do (some are only scheduled to play for a couple days). The valley could use more auditoriums, and a little more culture, but since it's all I got and it's not bad, I'll take this.~~#~0
Tasty in that oily, gonna-mess-you-up-tomorrow sense of the word. Inexpensive and generous portion sizes. Had the family meal of 3 entrees, rice and lo mein for 4 people for $20. General chicken, pepper beef, and pork spare ribs - not the most authentic perhaps and maybe that's why I'm only so-so on the place, but we've only ourselves to blame for the selections.~~#~0
After reading about some of the reviews I was still optimistic that some people were over critical.  The food was decent.  I got the Eggs Benedict and it was pretty good.  I got bacon but it was over done, burnt and dry. It came with cut large cut pieces of assorted fruit which as very much welcomed.  The busboys I think make the place happy.  They were always really polite and never reached without asking.  Most of the staff were either groggy (it is the morning I can understand that) or just not happy to be there.  I asked where the restroom was and a server bascially looked at me, looked at the direction to go, pointed and turned her back to me.  I asked a general question to managment and he directed someone else to answer it for me.  I felt a little offended by this gesture.  The food is good but I will say it would be nice to have staff that are bit more oriented towards customer service.~~#~0
I have been using this company easily for 15 years, before they changed to the current company name (sold I think).  I travel probably 6-8 times a year these days, but used to be much more frequently.  They give discount for AAA, which is good--makes it same as most coupones.  BUT finally, I am changing.  Some drivers are good, some drive too fast and agressively, and it's hit and miss what kind of service you get.    Generally, the pickup is fast at the lot and at the airport.  I do not like the reservation system for covered parking--it should be first come, first served--this is my final frosting on the cake.  I am changing and trying a different company today when I travel.  Too many times not so great service.~~#~0
Food was good. Service slow. Children screaming and pulling on curtains was distracting when trying to enjoy a nice meal. Would like to see management address parents to control their kids before it ruins the experience of other patrons. This has happened twice now!~~#~0
All my veggie friends love this place.  Offers gluten free meals too.  Enjoy their summer squash casserole.  Tried their corn and hatch chili pizza w/kale pesto which I enjoyed.  Somewhat noisy and always crowded.  They comp'd us a flourless chocolate cake for a birthday we celebrated.  Nice touch.  Lunch & diner menu is the same.  Get here early or you'll find yourself waiting.~~#~0
For some reason Extreme Pita isn't able to top the food at nearby Pita Pit. It's not that their isn't a good amount of pita selection ranging from those with beef to all veggie, or that they don't stuff those pitas full with lots of vegetables like they should. It's because I can't taste anything in those pitas! Today my pita was filled up with all sorts of nice veggies, humus, hot sauce, feta, and tzatziki . I caught the tzatziki but everything else just kind of transformed into cardboard in my mouth. Must be the large chain syndrome.Still, thanks for filling me up, and it's always nice to have a healthy fast food joint nearby.~~#~0
It's right next to REI!     And there's a picture of.. um.. I guess Cortez or Don Quixote or something but it's also a picture of.. uh..     They have pretty good coffee for a taco joint and their salsa is tasty.     If you've been to a *bertos you probably know the drill in general.    No surprises.~~#~0
The chicken shwarma, kaftta and hommus deluxe are excellent. The garlic sauce is so good I want to drink it. Can you smell my breath from here?Awesome staff and a cool store in the back. Try the cookies and the baklava, they're delicious.~~#~0
Cartel coffee seems to be the trendy place to hangout in Tempe complete with urban artwork made from left over bicycle parts, news clippings and artsy posters.  The furniture is equally eclectic, the chair I sat in was from an old hair salon and the table was just a couple of wooden boxes with a glass top.  If you're looking for a trendy place to hangout with your fellow mac users this could be it as long as you're willing to over look the damaged walls, peeling painted concrete floors and shoddy bathroom.~~#~0
I was passing by and saw this place and decided to come in cause my toenail polish was jacked up and I had about an hour to burn. The place was very nice, but I didn't think they had a huge selection of nail polish to choose from and I didn't really the massage chair they gave. Overall, my pedicure was nice and so was the lady that did my nails. I think the price was good enough that I'd come back here the next time I'm too lazy to paint my own toenails.~~#~0
Good service, tasty margarita, so so food. I went in on Tuesday night to have dinner and a couple of margaritas. I was by myself and I sat at the bar to eat. The bartender was busy with other customers when I came up, so it took him a little while to get to me which is understandable. Apparently it was Taco Tuesday which meant  $1 beef tacos and $2 Tecate beer. Unfortunately, I am allergic to onions and yeast, so both the attractively priced specials were off my list of options. I decided to go with the fish tacos, which the bartender recommended....I've had better. In fact, I've had better fish tacos at both Rubio's & Baja Fresh. The fish tacos came ala carte and were $4 apiece. $8 seems like a lot for two breaded fish sticks, sauce, and cabbage, each in a single flour tortilla. They weren't horrible, they were just OK, so so, mediocre...and they just weren't worth the price I paid. I would say they were $1 quality fish tacos. The bartender was fantastic and really friendly. My margaritas were also delicious. I thought they were priced a bit high at $8 each. They were served in what seemed like a smaller margarita glass, and as a previous reviewer mentioned, my glass was also filled to the rim with ice. When my drink was gone it was still filled to the rim with ice.So the good points were that the place had a friendly, laid back atmosphere, friendly and personable bartender, tasty margaritas, comfortable to hang out at, and I can ride my bike there. Downsides were that the margaritas were to small/over iced & a little too pricey, food was second-rate and over priced for what you got.Bottom line, it was a nice place to hang out at, and I would probably go back again just for margaritas at happy hour when they are half price.~~#~0
I almost always get the chicken swarma.  I have traveled the world and have tried chicken swarma in about 8 different places.  By far Dooby's swarma suits my taste the best.My kids enjoy the food here as well, they love sitting on the floor.  They also love the yellow rice and ask for yellow rice where ever we go to eat.The only ding I have is Dooby has raised prices and given a recesssion and that rice prices have reduced since they raise prices I have to say they have ventured into the high side for lunch.  They do allow for BYOD which saves drinkers money.Enjoy the food- too bad I don't eat there as often largely due to increae in cost.~~#~0
I can't tell whether the reason I haven't liked Irish bars in Cenpho proper is that I was spoiled by San Francisco and Galway or whether they're actually just not that good.  But that's my dilemma with Rosie's.  It's not bad, per se, but I don't know any bar that I would consider "bad".  It's just a little...disappointing.  Great Irish knick-knacks on the walls and a good variety of Irish beers.  Passable pub food and an oft-occupied stage complete the picture.  But something about it seems lacking.  It doesn't seem to have that homey feel that I always look for and something about parking in a Toys R Us lot is disturbing, especially on one's way to toss back a few pints.~~#~0
I had to come here, it's a West Coast tradition right? I was more excited to visit Phoenix for the food than to go to the Blackhawks vs. Coyotes game. I was biased based on my In-N-Out Burger experience, it has been on my wish list for YEARS. We passed a Jack-In-the Box and figured why not? This place is kind of like a Wendy's mated with a McDonald's but with the quality of a Burger King. There are a decent amount of options, enough to please even the pickiest of eaters (or someone who just has no idea what they want, story of my life). I went with just a plain chicken sandwich, after maxing on In-N-Out Animal Style can you really blame me? It was good, consistent, and not too greasy. The fries weren't mushy, which I appreciate. Nothing is worse that a gushy, mushy fry. On the way to the airport, this place was the perfect stop. The service was fast and efficient. I'm not sure if I would make the conscious decision to eat here again, but I'll try anything once!~~#~0
Good food.  A little overpriced.  Service was ok a little obnoxious but better than unattentive.~~#~0
I stayed at the Boulders Resort for 4 days, and I enjoyed escaping to the El Pedregal for a few meals.  It was an added benefit because we were able to charge it to our room.  There where a handful of stores, most of the store fronts where empty.   This could have been because of the off season, not quite sure but it wasn't a whole lot of shopping to be done at El Pedregal.We stopped in a quaint, and dainty store that had hats from long ago when ladies used to dress and go to church and wouldn't dare be seen without a hat as well as some one of a kind pieces.  She had a great jewelry stand shaped as a high heel shoe that could hold rings.  She also had some great shoes with simi-reasonable prices.  My companion and I both remarked that we could just google the retailer/designer for the shoes and jewelry box and get them for signficantly cheaper.  I googled later that evening and her items were only priced 25% more than amazon.com without factoring in shipping, so she really did have nice prices.There was a holiday store selling everything Christmas, and a salon complete with a mini boutique.  We left on Sunday morning, and they were setting up for the evening of jazz.  I would have definitely loved to stay because several people recommended it to us.I enjoyed the design and the architecture, and we took several nice pictures of the grounds for our scrapbooks :)~~#~0
I didn't really expect much from this place, but I think that the Ono's and other Hawaiian BBQs have this chain beat. I have to say that they at least saved me from spending way too much money on a light dinner when the rest of the restaurants were crowded and overpriced at WestGate.~~#~0
Got the crawfish boil...yum!  Good spice mix, but I would have loved to have it spicier.  The oysters were mediocre, not the best quality.  I prefer Ocean Trail for my oysters.  It was super busy, luckily I got there at 5 and didn't have to wait.  I'd really only come here for the crawfish--everything else was average and not special.~~#~0
This is a bowling alley, I don't frequent bowling alleys often but when I do its usually because I'm intoxicated, at a birthday party or a combo of both.  This bowling alley is not amazing but its not terrible either and they do have cosmic bowling if your into that kind of baloney, that being said I was there to cosmic bowl.. yeah.  Also you may of noticed an option on this yelp review for "Good for dancing" NO, NO ITS NOT THATS THE DUMBEST QUESTION EVER~~#~0
This place can either be 2 star or 4 star, depending upon the quality of the veggies they use. Sometimes the veggies are nasty and seem expired. Other times they are fresh and crisp. They offer plenty of sauces to flavor your dish with. However, the meat here is nasty as hell. It is frozen, nasty crap. I stick to veggies here... Overall good place if they keep their stuff fresh.~~#~0
Yummy cupcakes, but not all that to be honest. I still treat myself to a velvet cupcake everyonce and a while, though.~~#~0
I've decided that I need to get out more downtown for lunch and happy hour after work, since I'm so close.  A group of us went here for lunch.  Most ordered salad's which were huge everyone liked.  As a vegetarian, I found that the menu didn't have many options for me.  I could have order a good wrap or sandwich minus the meat, but $15 for the lobster wrap minus the lobster is a little steep.  All the main dish salads had meat too, which I was disappointed to see.  Service was pretty good , although the place wasn't busy.  They did bring out a yummy strawberry shortcake thing for a coworkers birthday, with plenty to share for 7 of us.  All in all, I probably won't be back because of the menu, but the atmosphere is nice.~~#~0
Have been waiting to try this place for weeks. Cozy little cafe and a cute little porch to sip mimosas (momos') on. The tables sit very close to each other so be prepared for ease dropping, at least I know i was doing it. First off, a guy by himself was sitting there and gave the most disgusted look when he had his eggs delivered to him and they were not cooked to a hard poached style he liked. Once he left I felt better about my day Lets talk about booze first. Loved that they give you a little bottle of champagne to refile your momo. I loved the fresh orange juice and orange wheel. Cute touch! BF ordered some ice coffee and also enjoyed that. For the day, I was feeling adventurous so I ordered the Monte Kristo. Stuffed with Gruyere and fresh strawberries, I was hoping it would be battered but it was all in between to soggy pieces of french toast. I think other people will like it as I have read in other reviews but it was too bold for the morning. Sweet potato tots were creative and yummy. Needs some sort of dipping sauce besides ketchup. BF ordered and egg white veggie omlete...first off, I don't even know how that would be good, cooked anywhere. pleh. We left with a lot of food on our plates. This place would be safer to go with breakfast staples like eggs, and bacon or maybe go for lunch.~~#~0
We all know what the decor is about.  The food is good, not great.  The large Pork Nachos is definitely large.  Pork was good, but they put diced pickles on there.  Not a pickle fan and the menu doesn't list the toppings.  The waitress just said pork, beans and cheese.  They were still good, just picked off tiny pickle pieces. The burgers are OK, 4 peaks does a much better job.  The beer selection is not listed on the menu and the waitress couldn't find her cheat sheet.  She had to keep going back to the bar to find out what they had on tap.  The best item was the apple turnover dessert.~~#~0
We discovered this place in the current Phoenix magazine today. The place has a great look outside, upon arriving and inside was just as pleasant. It has a great patio out back but goodluck finding it. I read that one is to follow the Paw prints on the floor...could not find the Paw prints and had to ask for directions. I did like that they provide Dog biscuits and water out back.We sat down starving, when our very friendly server, Hillary, immediately arrived to welcome us. Being our first time, we were eager to hear about the food but she completely assumed we were there to just drink. Are you pushing the brew here folks or the food? At least ask us why we are there first before you go on and on about the beer.We started out with the Garlic hummus, which was good but it came out rather quickly. I question whether it was freshly made or from Cisco Foods. The cucumbers that came with it, were dried out, gross and rubbery. My partner ordered the Green chili stew Tacos and I had the Barbecue hamburger. Both were ok..it's above average, Bar food and need improvement. One of the tacos had a big piece of gristle. Don't you check your meat chef before you send it out? Complete lack of focus and concern for the quality of the food being sent out. You might not care for my review but if you care about your brand and what you represent...not just your brewery...you will take our first visit review seriously.I know this may sound harsh but I must remain honest. People may come for great brew but they also for great food.~~#~0
After a weekend of St. Patrick's Day fare - decided that we wanted to go to Garduno's for their brunch.  We get to the restaurant and it's a totally different name.  What is this?  Shrimps?  Fish?  :)  We walked in half expecting EVERYTHING to be different.  It wasn't.  Everything is the same.  The brunch is still offered.  The only thing that's changed is the name.  It's been at least two months according to the hostess.  The menu according to her has changed just a little bit.  Today's visit didn't allow for us to review what possibly could have changed.  We were there for brunch.  For the most part service is still there.  I think wait staff tends to let us do our thing because it is brunch.  Never an empty water glass.  Refill on chips came right away.  Our waitress even offered to stay with an infant while the g-ma went up and got a plate.~~#~0
The worst service ever, EVER! The food is delicious though, service is literally a joke.~~#~0
Really cool place but sadly our service was horrid!! I have never seen such a rude waitress. I was a waitress and usually defend staff but she was snotty, unknowledgable, and rude. It was inexcusable.~~#~0
had a rainbow roll and spider roll.  much smaller rolls.interesting setup you order like a fast food restaurant and the food comes out to you.  i stood in front of the restaurant for like 10 minutes waiting to be seated and nobody came to help.  then finally someone came in and knew what  they were doing and just went up to the register in the middle of the room and ordered food like a mcdonalds.~~#~0
Just had drinks here, but seems like it would be a fun environment as the night wears on.~~#~0
Had some penne pesto and added some Italian Sausage.. the pesto was ok.. lacking a little salt and probably need to add a little more basil to the sauce.. but it was good.The pizza was better though for sure, but nothing amazing. Everyone there seems pretty nice and friendly. Will try it again and order something different to see how the rest of the food is.~~#~0
The Red Jade Chicken and Pork Quesadilla were good but the Pork Fried Rice was forgettable. Cookies were OK, but what do you want for free? Counter person was quick to offer help in how to order and a free sample if meat.~~#~0
One of the best values in a happy hour- both food & drink are on the reduced lunch plan. Fried pickles, ahi tuna salad and several big cold beers for under $30 including tip. Me likey. The fried pickles not the sliced kind you get at Hooters- these are fried whole, and they are worth the trip.Vibe here is a little dive-ish, and there was a mix of families in the section furthest from the bar, off-track betters & Phoenix hipsters at the bar, and plenty of non-descript folks here on the Friday night I attended. I'm a big fan of a mixed crowd, so I'm also a big fan of Armadillo.~~#~0
Love the history - architecture and original finishes (copper elevators!) are awesome. Outdated finishes (old carpet, really small bathrooms, shower water that randomly changes from cold to scalding) are not.Location is excellent - walk to anything you want downtown, train stop is a block away, adjacent to Seamus McCaffrey's and Ghost Lounge.We stayed one night and didn't have any problems with thin walls or cleanliness.Pool is up on the 3rd floor, which is cool.Price is really good.Overall, if you ever want to stay downtown and save some bucks, I totally recommend the Hotel San Carlos. Hotel San Carlos, if you are reading this, please please modernize the hotel somewhat (see Hotel Valley Ho) and I guarantee you will immediately draw a crowd.~~#~0
This place could probably be really romantic on the right night, but I haven't gotten lucky there yet.  Something's always felt just not quite right at The Roosevelt.  There are plenty of dark nooks and crannies in which to secret yourselves away, but unfortunately, the wait staff seems to lose track of you if you're too well hidden.The menu is mediocre and the booze is a little overpriced for the surroundings.  They were quicker to chase us off the front lawn for smoking than they were with our drinks, which is always a bad sign.  I think some warmth from the staff would go a long way--and I understand the place is run by wonderful people, so that shouldn't be a problem.  Hoping for better luck next time, as there aren't that many bars of its type downtown.  Yet.~~#~0
You have to love a place that still cares enough to use half a stick of butter when they cook your meal.  Throw in some Bourbon candied sausage and you have a real old fashioned breakfast cafe.~~#~0
To put it in one line Fleming's is a 3-star restaurant posing as a 5-star restaurant.The issue for me at my visit to Flemings was service.  The hostess was rather unenthusiastic.  It seemed was just her job to point us in the correct direction, which was the bar to wait as our table got prepared.  For a 5-star place, a reservation is a reservation, and the table should darned well be ready when advertised.  I expect to wait for a table at Outback, with the little buzzing and flashing beeper, but Flemings isn't Outback.  Right?  And as I will state later, getting the food orders correct was an even larger issue.For background, I was part of a large group (11 people) for dinner.  The bread served before the meal was absolutely delicious; fresh, hot, with a crispy crust, tender middle.  Drinks and salads were ordered.  I got a Caesar salad, and all I can say is that it was adequate. I have had a better Caesar salad at my employer's cafeteria.  But, I'm not there for the salad.  Fleming's is all about steaks.  The server moved around the table and took orders.  Our server was cheery and tried to make small-talk conversation with the table.  She took the orders where overall there were 8 steak orders (some of the couples got one meal and split it) and various sides.  I ordered the prime rib-eye; whenever I go to a steak place, it is my benchmark meal.  When the food arrived I had a very nice, although I would call it a bit small piece of Filet Mignon in front of me.  A very nice cut of meat, but it wasn't what I ordered.  Also, one of the couples at the table was not brought any food.  So, doing the math, the serving staff has a 25% chance in bungling your order.  The staff re-took the incorrect/missing orders and about 5 minutes later the manager was by to apologize.  The couple who had the missing order was offered a shrimp cocktail; I was not.  Maybe that is why I'm the odd person at the table.  I started munching on the community sides watching my other friends enjoying their steaks.  As for the sides, they were adequate like the Caesar salad; nothing to see here; although the Fleming potatoes were better than average.About 15 minutes later, my steak arrived, a bit rare for medium rare.  Gee that would make it rare.  I was hungry, and I ate it anyway.  The steak was very nice.  Tender and tasty, the way a good rib-eye ought to be.  To be honest it was one of the best rib-eyes I ever had, although slightly undercooked.  Much more tender than ones in those cowboy steak places.  There is something about the flavor of fat from a good rib-eye, and that is why it is my benchmark steak.  I was not alone on the notion under-cooked nature of the steak.  I guess from a management standpoint, undercooked is better than overcooked.  But I am of the school nothing goes back unless I am always within eyesight of my food.  I've seen the movie "Waiting".  We got desserts, and did them community style.  The walnut turtle pie seemed to be the best liked.  I didn't do the walnut turtle pie.  Walnuts are a bit bitter for my tastes.The timing for delivery of food was a bit slow.  This was "European" dining.  Reservation at 6:30, offered dessert 9:30.  So, in a way we owned the table for the evening, or maybe the staff realized they were not going to turn the table for another customer, and with a large group tip was set, so there was no need to hustle for the tip.  Slow service is fine, if that is what you expect.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed chatting with my other friends at the table, but this was not typical "American" dining service.  On the good side, the water glasses were filled with great regularity.  Water glasses were 12 oz glasses, and these glasses never got below half full.  Service from the bar was not as good.  I ordered a glass of Shiraz before the salad, and the glass arrived after the salad.  So, about 20 minutes to get my glass of house Shiraz.With respect to the food errors, the manager did deduct the two meal errors from the bill, and that was very generous from Fleming's management.  But mistakes like this will crush high end places.  From a profit perspective, that's $80 that Flemings management isn't going to get, and a not so stellar review on Yelp.So for me, I give Flemings a 4-star for food, 3-star for service, and a 2-star for value.As for me, I'm not a high end restaurant guy, but from the small amount of travel I do for the company I work for, I have seen some higher end restaurants.  I was expecting penultimate experience, and I received an Outback level service experience.  Ultimately, the question is: "Did you get what you paid for"?  For my money, it is a resounding no.  But Flemings is in the business to appease business types with expense reports and such.  It is sufficiently snooty enough to impress your customer, so the corporate sales guy can give the impression to his customers that the company he represents "cares".~~#~0
I had no idea that this place was a large national chain because, surprisingly, it has more of a 'local-bar' feel, complete with all the tools and townies in here who think that they will hook up with a waitress because he ordered a Hoegaarden instead of a Miller Lite.  Its a totally cheesy bar, but its not bad as a gamewatching spot for a game that you aren't completely invested in, maybe catching a beer, some chicken tenders, and a couple of quarters of the game before moving on to Home Depot across the street or something.  Writing this review, I'm actually surprised upon recollection how many times I had been here.  We used to come for Suns playoff games, which was virtually impossible for seating purposes (at this point they start having table-waits) and parking.  The atmosphere was better than your average Valley sports bar however.  People seem to really care about sports here, though I wouldn't really classify it as a 'sports bar', rather a neighborhood type bar with screens.I also used to come here for poker nights, which I doubt they still do as too many 'bags came to drink iced tea and wouldn't tip the waitresses.  Maybe someone can inform if they still do.Then, we used to come after soccer rec league games, which was kind of a dweeby thing to do in our footy kits, but whatever.  It was a few years ago, anyway.  Still, this is the type of place that gets people right from their beer guzzler rec leagues and into the bar still in their Mark Mitsubishi (Mark Mitsubishi) sponsored baseball tees.  This is the primary reason why you won't want to stick your hands into the huge barrels of Gardetto's mix, despite the unreal temptation for a dabble.  Overall, i suppose I can't really hate on this place too much.  Its kind of weak, but it is a decent option, particularly in the 'Took, where there just ain't many other options.  Just don't be one of the wanks who tries to pick up a waitress for the love of God.~~#~0
After spending two hours looking at (and listening to) some wonderful instruments, Violeta and I decided to meet up at the cafe.The place was hoppin'!  It was 1pm, and there were actually two sections in this room.  While they had the same furniture, one area felt like a coffee shop, with the rounded counter adorned with cookies and deli cases filled with bottles of water and juices, and I don't know what else, since we decided to sit in the other section, which had a more "open" feel to it.  Large glass windows that allowed nature to envelope you, at least a little bit, and, I would have to say, it felt like a bustling bistro.  A bustling tree-hugging green bistro (and I type this in a loving, respectful way).  Wished there was more than just one busser, though.  If there were more, it certainly looked like there was only the one.  Waited for awhile for tables to be cleared.  Finally, I had to walk up to him to ask if he'd clean up ours.  If I hadn't felt rushed to sit and relax while waiting for the food to arrive before leaving for school, I wouldn't have minded the wait so much.  I liked the organic, high-end feel to the place, and the busyness of the line cooks, who looked more like they should be cooking at a fancy steakhouse, and the presentations of the menus and food make you feel like you're really paying for quality here.  The menus allude to the usage of local produce and the occasional organic item, but I'd like to see higher-quality oils being used-- say no to GM soybean, canola, cottonseed, and corn oils!  I enjoyed my 6 oz. grass-fed burger and perfectly-crisped and seasoned sweet potato fries.  Next time, I'm going to have to check out the desserts.  Some looked absolutely devilish!p.s.  Didn't like having to retrieve my own cutlery or napkins.  The atmosphere calls for cutlery enfolded in cloth, and on the table, not sitting in metal holders, like you're at a buffet or at the cafeteria at work.  The paper napkins were of high-quality super-absorbent material, though, I must say.~~#~0
I will start with the disclaimer that I love independent coffee shops. I'm not a Starbucks girl. So I think I wanted to like Mama Java's better than I actually did. My co-worker and I headed there one afternoon to do a little work. We walked in and there was nobody there (but it was the middle of the afternoon on a weekday). The barista must have been hard of hearing because even though it was pretty quiet in there we had to repeat our orders several times. But he got them right eventually so I guess that's what really matters.We sat down at a little table near the window and over time the place did start to fill up. But there was just something about the vibe in there that I wasn't feeling that day. I can't put my finger on it but it just wasn't the comfy coffeehouse feeling I'm used to at other places. Maybe it was just what I was working on.I would go back but I wouldn't rush back. Sorry!~~#~0
The boys and I were out at the Papago jump park; working up an appetite. We decided on something with A) beer and B) between our two places. We all had never been to Kitchen 56, so we thought we give it a go. When we arrived, the place was dead. However, the waitress and bartender were both ignoring us and it took about 20 minutes to get drinks. I was stoked that they served pbr in the can. The lunch menu looked amazing and we all got something different. I ordered the chorizo burrito which was tasty and not too greasy and the beau ordered the pulled pork which was delicious minus the generic bun. Our friends said their food was excellent but the service was slow and in an almost dead restaurant that is unacceptable. Our waitress came back about 30 minutes after our food arrived and we were all through our beers and would've ordered more if there hadn't been such a long delay but at that point we just wanted to get on with our day. Next time, we'll just order take out and skip the poor service.~~#~0
Those who like serving themselves And then paying for it. Will love this place. Once you retrieve your food. You will enjoy the smokey flavors, of the half of chicken, brisket and pulled pork. Too bad about the  Mushy corn bread  Liked the the fresh veggies healthily grilled.   Nice options for wine by the glass, too.  BBQ is back and this is the place to enjoy it.~~#~0
Low on pretension, high on kitsch factor.  It's not a bad dive bar to hang out at on a First Friday (or any other friday, for that  matter).~~#~0
Have gone to X Tapas since 2006, never had a bad experience.Food is priced right for what it is.Won't blow your mind but won't make you wish you had Chipotle.  On par with Valle Luna, just a few $ more than the old Luna.~~#~0
I love this team, but really.  Someone needs to help them, big time.~~#~0
When you walk in, you're assaulted with a decor that some people think represents Hawaii: surfboards, pineapples, a smattering of "exotic" words and sayings, twangs on a uke overhead, and bold splashes of green and blue. Very, very slick and expected marketing. As you can tell, this is a turn-off for me, because it's inauthentic. It's a little much. But the food is decent. The grilled mahi mahi plate is actually good because the fish tastes fresh (for AZ) and there is a brown rice option. The mac salad is a little bland (cardinal sin for locals) and the dipping sauces simply confuse me. They bring nothing to the items on the plate. I've also had the katsu (breaded fried chicken) which was ok, but didn't remind me of local kine grinds. I think Moki's is worth a shot. But I'm actually disappointed that they had malasadas at the Aloha Festival but don't have it at their restaurant - because that would be one huge draw for me. It's great they have kalua pork on the menu.  But I'll personally only go now if outvoted. Because for real authentic Hawaiian (without the tackiness), I go to L&L. And then Ono Hawaiian.~~#~0
Ehh.  Average food.  Fun tropical atmosphere, however.~~#~0
Neat, modern shop. Restaurant was very clean. Frozen yogurt and add-your-own topping selection was large and I was offered samples shortly after walking into the place. The yogurt quality was fine, but certainly nothing spectacular.My biggest complaint about this location was the absolute lack of available parking. I arrived shortly before noon on a Monday and had to circle the parking lot twice while fighting for a parking space. What was more surprising is that in spite of the over-crowded parking lot I was one of only two customers in Zoyo.The yogurt was fine but definitely not worth the hassle.~~#~0
Good food but nothing to drive 20 miles for.  Guy Fieri helped bring a lot of business here and now their prices show it.  I dropped $17 on a burger, fries and chocolate shake.  Not bad for once a year but I can think of better ways to spend nearly $20 on a meal.This is a small establishment with walk-up ordering and call your number when finished just in case anyone was expecting something more fancy.  Don't leave without getting the garlic fries.  Practically worth the entire meal itself.~~#~0
We are big fans of Paradise Bakery..we eat there at least 2-3 times a week (it's down the street from us..can you blame us)?!Much like Paradise Bakery, there is a soup and salad/sandwich combo offering.You get a whole sandwich, AND a lovely chocolate dipped strawberry (disappointing for my husband-he really loves the cookie thing at Paradise Bakery).I had a pulled pork sandwich (great) and the Yucatan Chicken soup (sooo good) you can even sample the soup! How fun is that?!My only complaint, is that it feels a tad claustrophobic at this location. The tables are all jumbled together and there is this "recharge your device" thing in the center that is really very wasted space. If the tables were spaced out more, I would definitely give this 4 stars. Someone else mentioned the awkward feel of the ordering area. I'm going to agree on that, though I felt that way with Paradise bakery. It can feel a little chaotic when it's crowded and you're not quite sure what to do.~~#~0
The best thing about this place is the atmosphere.  They really do have a nice setup in there, and the food is stylish.Unfortunately, if you're going to the restaurant to eat (but really, who does that?), it's nothing special.  I had the Chimichangas (which they for some reason spell with a 'v'), and while it was certainly edible, and enormous, it didn't really have much flavor.  It seems they think dousing something with spicy hot sauce is enough.  I like spicy food as much and anybody, but spice alone is not enough to make a good dish.The portions were more than enough, but I'd rather have great tasting food that satisfies my hunger than a boat load of passable food.~~#~0
The first time I went here, I got the shredded beef burrito ($6.29) and thought it was just ok (it was HUGE).  However, I LOVED their warm chips ($.99) and guacamole ($2.69)!  Although I've revisited this location, I haven't tried anything else off their menu...I just run in for an order of chips and guacamole.  My mouth is watering just thinking about the lightly salted chips and tangy guac.BTW, although I prefer Qdoba's chips, for burritos, I prefer Baja Fresh.  As others have mentioned, Qdoba is just like Chipotle.  It's even located across the street from Chipotle...go figure.~~#~0
Family owned thai restaurants are incredibly consistent.  I have yet to have a bad Curry, Pad Thai, or Stay.  It is always very vibrant and flavorful.  Thai Spices carries on that tradition of consistency as everything was good and to our expectations.  Nothing more, nothing less. The location is diverse and clean.  While it had the customary pictures of Thai royalty on the wall, the decor was decidedly different and contemporary urban. All in all a good spot.  A solid candidate for the best thai in Mesa.~~#~0
This bike shop was okay, but I preferred Tempe Bikes more. Also, even with clearance prices, they still seemed a bit pricey and I know I can find the same things a bit cheaper at other bike shops. Still a nice selection of bikes and parts and the staff was nice.~~#~0
Overrated. I had a $17 bowl of ramen. Food was pretty bland and uninspiring. Not terrible, just not worth the prices. I had a smoothie also, which was also meh. The desert tasted like a cliff bar with some stuff on top. The appetizers were ok.~~#~0
Fresh fish in Phoenix.Say that 5 times fast. Maybe it'll come true. Or maybe, just maybe, you'll find yourself at The Fish Market. For lunch, I had their smoked salmon and tuna. I also ordered the artichoke heart. Mmm. I was anticipating something mouth-watering - a lunch meal I had to rave about later. What I got was pretty okay. The fish was cut up into chunks (yes, chunks) and the artichoke was pretty bland, despite how super yummy one can be, if prepared right. Price was reasonable. $5 for the 'choke; $8.50 for the salmon/tuna order, that came with some interesting sides: tasty pesto, crunchy crouton bread-thingys and this white stuff i had no idea what it was (no, it wasn't tarter; i tried it).The menu is large. It's hard to decide. Crab. Oysters. Fish tacos. Smoked Salmon. Shrimp Salads. Oh my.The service was decent - the type you appreciate at the time but can't really remember a day or two later. We got warm, fresh bread brought to our table, too, and plenty of drink re-fills. Overall, a good lunch. If I ever went again, I'd order something else. Too bad Phoenix lacks fresh fish options. Because, if this is as good as it gets, I better pack my bags tonight and hit the road for Seattle.~~#~0
The food here is pretty good and very traditional.  They have a very large menu of all sorts of sushi and all sorts of other Japanese dishes, including LOADS of noodle dishes.  The sushi selection is awesome and the menus have pictures of everything.  The price is very reasonable.Why did it get 3 stars?  The service.  I've had to wait a VERY long time to be seated and the wait staff doesn't come around a lot.  The sushi cooks are kinda rude and didn't talk to us at all.  But if you can get past the horrible service this place is worth a visit for the food.  The price is good too.~~#~0
I just had lunch at the Phoenix City Grille. The food was pretty good, but the service was not the best.  I got the Green Chile Burger, and it was pretty good. We were served quickly, but the waitress didn't come check on us for several minutes. I needed mayonnaise for the burger, but I had to wait at least 10 minutes for the server to return to ask for it. I also had a mimosa. It was good, but the server never asked if I cared for another. The server only asked me if I wanted more water when it was time to leave the restaurant.  It also seemed to take awhile to get the check and pay for the food. The restaurant was only moderately busy, and it seems like they only had a few servers working. I really don't fault the server. It just seems like she was waiting on too many people.~~#~0
I went here over a two day period for seminars. Didn't stay in a room so I can't speak to that. The facilities are a little dated, but nice for sure. The wi-Fi is pay only for guests.~~#~0
This is such an awesome concept with so much potential! I like the idea of a trendy, downtown bowling alley with a hip bar and snazzy feel. (I also love old school bowling alleys as well- especially the bars...top notch!) Anyhow, Lucky Strike looks really cool. The main point being "LOOKS". When you actually touch something and focus, this place is made of complete crap. It just looks nice because it is new. The balls are cheap and generic. The floor, lanes and light fixtures are worse than Ikea. They have little plastic stools that probably cost a buck. Give this place a little wear and the poor quality will start to show. There also aren't a lot of lanes? The bar/restaurant area is bigger than the actual bowling alley portion. Hopefully the entrance is finally completed because we had to walk up some creepy closed in stairwell strewn with old food. If you are going to charge over 20 bucks for two hours of bowling and attempt to be snazzy and upscale, then commit to that. We went around happy hour time and they had some "deals" if you want to call them that. The glasses of wine were so very tiny. About a half a glass each. Our server was nice, but really slow. So we would order another drink as soon as she brought one so it would time out (about 15 min between). I don't really get it either since we were the only people bowling. Better hope you aren't a Vegetarian because your only option on the menu we had was soft pretzel sticks. At least they were really tasty and had nice presentation. This place has good potential for sure. Come and enjoy. I just don't think the quality is worth the cost. .~~#~0
Ah yes, American sushi.    White, frat boy sushi chefs.   The server was under 21 so her friend had to drop off the drinks as she followed here to the table.It's an alright place, not bad for ASU but that's where the buck stops. The asparagus app. was good. The rolls were good.  We didn't get sick, good.Smoking hot Asian hostess..... arrrrrrrr...............~~#~0
I've wanted to try this buffet for a long time, since it's close to where I live and I pass by it all the time. Got my chance today, and was it worth the visit? Well, I did enjoy my meal but It wasn't something to write home about, either. I would say it's a moderately good Chinese buffet, not great. Some of  the dishes were just OK, some were good, a few were great. Recommended dishes: their fried chicken (just lightly flour-dredged, not thickly battered, and very tasty), the Singapore rice noodles, and the shrimp dishes. Other dishes, including dessert, were about typical for a  large Chinese buffet restaurant.  The restaurant is very spacious and the servers were very friendly. My meal here was not spectacular, but pleasant and satisfying enough.~~#~0
The good: the atmosphere was nice. Weeknight shopping then girl date with BFF YL. The mediocre: The food is just average. First off, stay away from the sushi. YL and I didn't get sick, it just wasn't good. The calamari came in a large portion for an app, but it was too crusty and overdone so it was too chewy. We also had the clam chowder which was just okay. The bad: Our waiter was a bit spastic and came back way too often and way too quickly. I swear he only gave us 45 seconds to look at the menu, we asked for more time, and the he returns less than 2 minutes later. Grrr...~~#~0
Okay burgers. Unlimited toppings for no extra charge.  Awesome fries. Cool soda machine.~~#~0
Devil's is overpriced, the crowds are so awkward and the the bouncers are rude. Frankly, I've been there on Halloween and recently, and it hasn't impressed me. Glad to have been there to know, but won't go back.~~#~0
After finding a fabulous fro-yo shop in Newport Beach, I've been on a quest to find something at least semi-fabulous closer to home. This one's not bad.Compared to other fro-yo shops, I like the flavors at this one: refreshingly sweet...but not so sweet that you'll go into some over-the-top richness coma. And if you are a topping junkie, you have choices...lots of them...but the other reviewers are right -- it's not a little yogurt to go with your topping -- it's a topping. The shop is also neat and clean, which is a big deal in my book.Here's the catch: sometimes they are busy and sometimes they aren't. What this means is that the one person they have working there is ready to assist you when you walk into the empty store...but if there are a few people in line ahead of you, you'll be waiting awhile.~~#~0
The resort is pretty nice.....We had a nice room with a view of the golf course. The hotel charges a resort fee of $19 which pays for your use of the facilities such as the pools, tennis courts, and fitness centers, but here's the thing we arrived late in the day around 7pm and were leaving first thing in the morning and had NO time to use any of the facilities so I can't say much about that. It sucks we had to pay the fee after not using any of the accommodations but oh well.....The room was clean and beds were comfortable and feature a small table for two, two queen beds, two desks, and a flat screen TV. The hotel bathroom offered 2 bath robes which was nice to wrap yourself up after a shower. And of course the hotel had free WiFi so I was happy.~~#~0
Once a 4-star mall, thought of by many to be more of a 5-star amenity to the area, I was really quite disappointed on my last visit to Chandler Mall.  Not only does it look like it's going downhill, but it's just a less pleasant experience altogether.For whatever reason, they have removed almost all the directories (and no I'm not just paranoid or blind -- the guy at the security counter confirmed this).  Why in the world would they do this?  Maybe they're catering to the ages old tradition of mindlessly wandering around and spending money at every stop, but I thought that went outta style like real estate bubbles.  So for those of us on a mission to find what we need and get out, this is rather infuriating.  I may have wasted a total of only a few minutes before finding an information counter, but it felt much worse.  I now hate this mall and have no plans to return to it any time soon.Chandler Mall is a pain, and I now refuse to deal with it.  And I'm sure I am not the only one.~~#~0
Pretty good but small portions~~#~0
A nice dependable alternative to the ubiquitous chains that dot the PHX landscape.  Service varies on day and location.  I find the Central Ave. restaurant to be the better of the few in the area, plus it's around the corner from my place. The decor is a bit suburban-Midwest soccer mom, but the food is solid.  I usually get the Monterey, Bacado or Old Pueblo skillet.  A neighborhood joint - you're more likely to see gay singles on weekends than the seniors.~~#~0
I like Saigon.  I usually get the chicken w/ lemon grass, can't remember the number.Downfalls are the facility, dated and dingy, and the quality of the meat.  At the prices they are charging, you aren't going to get all white meat chicken or the better cuts of beef and pork.~~#~0
One of my favorite locations because it is conveniently located across from my work building. The parking is good - even better for me since I can walk. The concessions are cheap - $4 for a hot dog or soda. A combo pack of a hot dog, drink and popcorn for $11. The views are good and provides good access to players if you want to try for an autograph. As another reviewer pointed out, there is no outfield grass, which is a disappointment. Another thing that is down is the feeling in your ass after sitting on the metal bleacher style seats down the left field line  - but for $7, good parking, nice location and cheap concessions, I am a fan.~~#~0
This place scares me, and I'm a sample-sale/50%-off-at-Goodwill's expert. I haven't experienced here any of the grabbing or poking or pushing over that I've had happen to me at sample sales in New York or at the Barney's Warehouse sale (or Black Friday/Boxing day sales). But this is a whole different breed of sales shopping. Clothes are sorted by size and style (sweaters. outerwear. dresses. long-sleeve tops. etc.) so the racks are jumbled and messy. The women's shoes section is frightening because there is just so much product and not enough room in the aisles to check things out without bumping into someone. There are a few big labels in the mess, but a lot of is broken. I found Miu Miu flats that were hideous but still $99. I found a pair of Valentino heels that were missing its straps. I found Jimmy Choos that were missing pretty much every embellishment. Most of the stock is from mid-level brands, like Kate Spade, Stuart Weitzman, and high street brands like Steve Madden (tons!). It takes a LOT of digging to unearth anything halfway decent and unbroken. And you will find other stuff, like 5-inch rhinestone platforms, that will make you think "Oh but this is such a deal!" except once you get them home you will wonder where on earth you'd ever wear them. And by then it's too late, because returns are not allowed. I'd recommend going here if you know exactly what you're looking for and won't be easily swayed by something you don't need.~~#~0
Went to this Restaurant Sunday for lunch.  From the outside the place looks clean and a nice place to stop and eat.  We walked in and I walked around to see if there were any servers or if we just ordered and picked up our own food.  I found someone that worked there and they said just to sit anywhere.  I noticed the place was pretty empty on a Sunday, only about 3 other tables were full.  We sat for a couple of minutes when our waitress walks up and hands us some menu's and takes our drink order.  A couple minutes later our drinks arrive and a basket of chips and two types of salsa are served.  Right away I notice the chips are fresh, seemed like they were made that day.  They were nice and hot and just seemed really fresh, very salty but I like mine that way so I was good.  Looking around the surroundings looked very colorful, lots of different colored walls to look at.  They have booths or tables to sit at, and the place looked clean from where I was sitting.  I ordered chicken flautas al cart and a soda.  My husband got a beef chimichanga and their flavored Ice Tea.  Our food was served pretty fast and was hot.  I got a couple of flautas served on a heaping bed of lettuce with a side of guacamole.  My flautas were pretty good.  The chicken tasted fresh but the flavor needed a little boost of something, can't put my finger on it.  But it was pretty good.  I tasted my husbands and it was good.  The prices at this place were reasonable, $7-$12 a plate.  The place was a quiet sit down place on a Sunday afternoon.~~#~0
So many tragedies on Camelback Mountain, like this one today.   http://www.azcentral.com/community/phoenix/articles/20121029hiker-dies-after-falling-from-echo-canyon-cliff.html~~#~0
Ok...I wish you could do a 3.5 because that's what my rating would be...but since you can't...The subs are really good (specifically the #5) and they're usually made quickly which is nice..my only complaint is that for some reason, they can't do ingredients on only half of the sandwich or just put them on the side altogether for those of us who don't like onion. This really makes no sense to me so maybe I'm missing something but it's kind of a pain in the ass. Other than that, the employees are friendly. I'll keep coming back most likely but it might be something that should be considered.~~#~0
The first time I ate here was when my in-laws visited two years ago.  I had the teriyaki glazed salmon, and found it to be just okay.  The garlic mashed potatoes are whipped so I didn't really enjoy that either.After the food situation at ZooBrew was a bust, Dottsy Z and I with our plus ones zipped over here for dinner on Friday evening.  First off, we had excellent service, and there was free live soft porn for entertainment.  Stay tuned for Dottsy's review--she had the best view of the "action."  We started off with the toasted ravioli with meat.  I didn't think it was great, but I would have preferred the cheese.  My husband had a steak which he said was very good.  I went with the smoked salmon appetizer for a light dinner.  "Light dinner."  There are two words that usually aren't next to each other in my vocabulary.  With the salmon was warm pita, a horseradish mousse, and capers.  I couldn't detect the horseradish which was fine with me.  The plate was a nice combination of flavors.  A little green apple or cheese might be a nice addition, but I enjoyed it.I might have bumped Frasher's to four stars had Dottsy's plus one not found a piece of plastic in his sandwich (supposedly from the turkey).  As it is, I still can't say that I'm a fan.~~#~0
Good service and our waiter was super nice and helpful with suggesting items because it was our first time having Cuban food. Everything was good, but not great. I did love the garlic rice though. I couldn't stop eating it.~~#~0
This was a good restaurant to try once I moved here but I probably wouldn't go back again. For being names "Sauce" its sauce wasn't too great. The menu is tiny but everything I had was pretty good. It is a great place to grab a bite but not one to rave about.~~#~0
This place has an awesome deal on Thursday nights(not sure if it's all day)!  This is the only time we really go to the movies because the price is better than paying for a student ticket priced at $7.  So for a better theater than harkins or AMC thats a great deal!  I like how far the chairs can recline back but i don't think the regular seats are anything worth bragging over or highly recommending because they feel kind of cheap like a fake leather and definitely not LA-Z boy status.  just a nice theater seat spruced up and not as cushiony.  service cannot really tell you because i have not gotten much interaction with anyone. My boyfriend hands me my ticket we hand it to the ticket stub person and off we go. No customer service to review/critique.From what i can remember the better chairs were okay not on Ipic level but better. is it worth the extra money on a Thursday if you could upgrade id say yes. but on a regular day no.~~#~0
I have to agree with the rest of my yelping friends that Churn rocks I've been here on several different occasions because like Amy D. I live close enough to walk....... out of my visits all have been fine but one........ I however have never thought that it was any better than the rest of the trendy Ice cream, soda pop, coffee shops that seem to be popping up all over and it's even harder for me to justify 16$ for a sundae for me and one for my friend I rather walk next door to Windsor and get a couple of beers and a great appetizer for the same 16$...........  Til next time~~#~0
Pizza is okay. The cranky woman usually behind the counter who answers the phone and takes orders is rude and unpleasant - if not for her, might add a star.~~#~0
We've been to Saddle Ranch a few times on the weekends for a late breakfast and have been pleased with the food and service on both occasions.  While far from upscale, the atmosphere is unique and has a nicely put together "wild west" theme.  The food is inexpensive (approximately $10 for a breakfast entree) and as such, the quality is nothing to brag about, but the meals are a good value for the price.  I've had the egg-white veggie omelet and the huevos rancheros, both which were flavorful and not greasy.  The hash browns are a bit bland, but edible.  They also offer $3 bloody marys and mimosas.  The death valley extra spicy bloody mary has good flavor, but the mimosas are a bit heavy on OJ and light on the bubbly, although what do you really expect for $3?  This isn't a place that we'd be likely to try dinner at, but we'll be back for another breakfast or maybe try out lunch next time.~~#~0
Craving lamb kabobs we tried MBFGR.  My guest ordered the lamb kabobs that come with roasted potatoes and a broccoli/cauliflower mix.  He loved the lamb, nice portion.  But the potatoes and vegetable mix were unremarkable.  Passable.  Perhaps a little garlic on the vegetables might have helped.  I had a pork souvlaki.  It came with a greek salad.  Pork was perfectly cooked and delish.  I am glad I didn't have the full dinner only to  suffer with the potatoes and tasteless veggies.  Management:  fix those veggies.  Do something!  We found the desserts to be overpriced ($7) so we didn't partake.~~#~0
I've had pleasant experiences eating here.  The food is pretty good and greasy.  The price...can't beat it.  My only concern is cleanliness.  The last time I ate there the bathroom had crickets dead and alive all over the ground.  Not appetizing!  I've also heard from certain folks (more than 3) that they have found bugs in their food.  Well, it's under new management now and the place has really shaped up!  Give it a chance!~~#~0
Typical college bar.  Have never been there at night, never want to go there at night...Average average average.~~#~0
A-OK is a "depends" rating ... for little kids the fields are fine.Super dusty and the raised areas between fields is odd.Artificial mounds -- I understand WHY they use them, but it's a disadvantage for baseball beyond 10-12 year olds.I like the multi-purpose layout and options -- batting cages, ball fields, play areas for kids, sand volleyball.Was there in November, so didn't need any air conditioning and shade for cooling off wasn't much of an issue.  The field lighting was great!~~#~0
Oh the Lodge.  Very casual.  Very stinky!  Life size Jenga game in the back! Awesome, drunk board games (even better when life size) are so much fun!Lotsa seating.KITCHEN WAS STILL OPEN EVEN LATE!!! Score for the food!That's all.~~#~0
Guacamole Bacon Six Dollar burgerThis ranks amongst the few fast food burgers that really satisfies the craving for a big chunk of ground beef with enough stuff on it that it is guaranteed to come apart before you are done and make sure you are wearing some of it too. Price was reasonable at $7.49 for a combo meal.  With fries that comes to 1360 calories, mostly from fat.  And 3000mg of sodium.  I'm going to have to eat a bunch of rabbit food to counter that. :-)This location has been there 4 or 5 years and while I have eaten from there many times it is the first time I have gone over there and eaten in.  The floor paint is the only thing I saw with any real wear to it.  Everything was nice and clean.  The "new" concept of service where you order at the counter and they bring it to your table has been around at Carl's Jr and Whataburger for as long as I remember.  They even came to clear my table just as I put the last bite in my mouth.~~#~0
THE GOOD: A great place to kill an afternoon or evening. Great place to buy used books and music. They also have stuff for gamers.THE BAD: Its in mesa. the nasty part. tweekers trying to sell stolen stuff. So just know its a rough crowd.TRADE: they take a fair amount of stuff I bring in. Make sure stuff is in good to very good condition. Store credit they offer is fair. the cash payout for stuff is not. ALWAYS take the credit. Also realize that religious books are very common so don't get mad when they don't take all of your stuff.BOOKS: this is there strongest point. They really have everything. I mean everything. I also love that everything in the store is used.MUSIC: is way over priced! The vinyl prices are so high. the condition of the LPs is scratched. However I've scored some treasures using my credit form trades. In light of that its still worth looking if you've traded with them.~~#~0
Modern Steak is probably not the type of place where you would normally find me. I had read great reviews about the sliders at the pick-up window (a.k.a. Modern Burger). So when a friend and I ended up going on a Fashion Square for an adventure lunch one day, we decided to give the restaurant a try. The decor? Uh, if Z' Gallerie, Liberace and New Orleans Square at Disneyland had a love child, this is exactly what it would look like. It's a festival for the visual senses. (Check out the bathrooms.)We ended up grabbing some comfy seats in the bar area, noted the mirrored ceilings and ordered up. I was a bit disappointed to see they didn't have sliders on the menu, but I ordered Kobe burger and it turned out to be a more than worthy substitute. After ordering a Blood and Sand (it was either that or a Pimms Cup) from the drink menu, my pricey lunch was complete. The only distracting element--well, other than the fact if you look up you can see yourself--is the female bar staff are apparently asked to wear uniforms that consist of a navy shorts jumper with a very wide belt and Ugg boots. This reminded me again of Disneyland, and how these poor souls had definitely pulled the short straw in the uniform department.It's Scottsdale, it's Fashion Square, it's Fox Restaurant Concepts--you def have to be in the right mood for it, but if you are...enjoy.~~#~0
great place to shop 24/7.  2 Red boxes located right at the entrance.  Usually stocked, clean, and good produce compared to the other chain stores.  This is a FOOD walmart only, only go here for your pantry items, no clothes, car parts, etc., here.  Has self checkouts to speed things up if you don't have produce, can be a pain if you are buying your veggies and fruits.Another interesting point is that this location has a table dedicated to markdowns, sometimes you can get a deal on products without couponing :)~~#~0
When I buy from a truck I assume it should be a good value as their overhead is low with out a building etc. However I think I am paying more because the are only open a few hours a day and need to be sustained on those limited hours. This hold true with uprooted, I paid $8 for a spinach, and tempeh bowl, it had some walnuts and blue cheese. At a normal casual counter style place for this size it would be $4.50 for this salad. Value aside the food was good, and healthy as I was hungry about 12 minutes later.My cynicism is really directed at the food truck craze and not this trailer as they are on part with the lack of value~~#~0
After hearing a bit about Five Guys online, I decided to give them a try.  First impression walking in was very positive.  I liked the decor and the free self-serve peanuts.   Unfortunately, that did not last.  My jaw literally hit the floor when I saw the prices.  Over $5 for a hamburger from a counter-service (i.e. fast-food) restaurant?  Worse yet, I had my three kids with me and Little Cheeseburgers are over $4 each.  I have to say we almost walked out, but I still wanted to try it.   So we proceeded with ordering. I got the hamburger with french fries.  The hamburger was very good.  No doubt about that.  The french fries were okay, but nothing special.  If the burger would have been $3 - $4, I'd probably say it was one of the best I've had in that price range.  At over $5 though, there are many just as good if not better options.Bottom line: good food, but way overpriced.~~#~0
It's a pretty airport. But it's pretty spread out. Maybe it's just the US Airways gates or something ... I don't like how both times I went through here on my connecting flights I had the walk of justice to get from one gate to another on the same airline, 1.5 hours apart. I don't even have that problem at ATL.Also - I can never hear when their employees speak over the loud speaker. It's supposed to be LOUD isn't it? I always stop and think, "are they talking to me?" You never know what they are saying.I haven't had a problem with any delays or cancellations or anything. I just don't like the layout.~~#~0
I liked Teharu better, but this place does have greater variety and is much closer to home. It'll do when we get the craving for sushi lite and don't have time to drive.~~#~0
Wow, look at some of the horror stories for THIS ONE!  So Mike C. & I got our cells queued up to call the paramedics & lurched in through the door.     :-OIt turned out that the worst thing about this Buffet restaurant is that it's just east of the fabulous "The Buffet" at Harrah's Ak Chin Casino.  How to you go here instead?  It was hard!     :-)Ok, let's get the authentic bad news out of the way first:*  They open at 11 AM, but didn't have all of the 40 main food items out until around 11:30.  Not ok!*  There was salad dressing, but no salad!*  They just put out a little bit of each food item at a time, so everything kept running out!SO, 1 Star & whip over to "The Buffet", eh?  Well, we're here already, so...  ?So then there was GOOD NEWS!*  The decor is simple but clean looking, & offered a choice of comfortable booths or table seating.*  The food was good!  (That's one thing, isn't it?)  I particularly liked the fried chicken, the the very mild tasting White Spring Salmon, & the Stuffed Scallops, but everything was tasty & offered up at the right temperature.It's 3 Stars for this place that needs a little fine tuning but delivers up a good Lunch Buffet for only $5.99!     :-)~~#~0
This night club use to have a way classier crowd. They must of switched promotors.Now it's just ghetto. Love the music they play and all but the crowd is awful. There is not once where I have gone there where there wasn't a fight or a shooting of some sort. I recently gone there on New years eve, my friends and i decided to stop by. One of the waitresses there was awfully rude. In fact she was cussing at my friend because my friend was in her way, but if you go to this club you would know that it's rediculously crowded and you can barely walk. So I asked the waitress what was wrong and she swung her hand out and punched me. I fell over and slipped. So disrespectful. My friend and i got kicked out all because we wanted to know what the problem was. Horrible. that was rude and disrespectful of and employee to treat their customers this way. Bad business.~~#~0
I'm an out of towner...east coast that is...so what do I know? I travel alot and rely on yelp for ideas regularly. Craving Mexican type food I found Filiberto's was highly rated and nearby.I ordered the following:- Carne Asada taco- Fish taco- Green Chile burritoLong story short....Carne Asada was ok...I mean better then taco bell but not hot & fresh. The fish taco was a total waste of money unless you like cabbage & onions. Now, the Green chile burrito was from a different place. It was hot, fresh, saucy and tasty. Maybe a tad heavy on sodium but hit the spot. So, save your money, get the green chili burrito for $3.72 call it good.~~#~0
It was a thursday night and pretty crowded, so I would be curious to see how this place is on weekends. The crowd seemed half ok, half douchey or just plain scary. I'm not sure if they are actual thugs or just posers, but I'm pretty sure there was some drug dealing going on in the parking lot. Maybe it's just the ASU crowd but the girls were dressed pretty slutty for a dive bar on a thursday night. The bar has two sides: the live music side seems more sketchy, whereas the beer/whiskey room is well lit with a good amount of seating and two bar sized pool tables. I heard they have cool shows, so I would like to come back to check that out. Bathroom on that side is surprisingly clean.~~#~0
Comfort food... Basic down-home dinner. :-) sometimes ya just gotta.~~#~0
The pizza is decent but the standout here is the antipasto plate.  They also have some great beers and I like the small house feel to the place.  Great spot next door too, palate.~~#~0
We went here last weekend after an even in AZ. There was a HUGE group of us, we took up two rows of tables. The atmosphere was good, prices are affordable and even with a group as big as our, we had excellent service up until the end. The food was tasty, I ordered the cheese steak, a friend of ours had the classic nachos with chicken and beef. Both were good. The tea was a bit.... bland? I only had a taste, as it was my husband's drink. It left much to be desired. At the end of the meal, we were the last to be given our tabs and the server never came back to take the payment. We waited for about 10 minutes while our groups was dispersing. Wouldn't have been such a big deal if we didn't have to follow some of them to get home. When I approached our server to offer my card, it was as though I was interrupting her for no reason... then she remembered she hadn't collected our payment. I was tempted to walk out, but couldn't do that to the poor girl. I know what it's like to be busy, but there could have been more attention to detail here. I would go back, for sure, though. It was a good place.~~#~0
Love it here. I like Thit Nuong, the best. The staff is slow because there are only one guy. The other guy is the owner. Think they should hire more people. Otherwise, anything else is good.~~#~0
It's not the best Carribbean restaurant I've been to, but I did like that they had some unique items on the menu. The rum glazed prawns with roti were good. The mussels dish came with tons of mussels and a flavorful broth. The dessert was a disappointment, but I would give it another try and try another item if I am in Phoenix again.~~#~0
Formerly known as "Sundays"  this place has really changed. They have decent food, a laid back bar, patio, and Karaoke on Wednesday and Saturday nights. (located next to Zipps on Camelback)This is a very casual restaurant/bar - it could almost classify as a dive bar -- but the drinks are too pricey for that. They have definitely moved in the right direction decor wise and they need to keep moving that way...I'm pulling for you...~~#~0
stopped in for lunch last Saturday and liked the casual aspect of the restaurant. my friend and i ordered salads right away and during our short wait, noticed flies all over the place. we were disgusted but too hungover to do anything about it. the waitress got my order wrong so I had to wait an additional 5-7 minutes for my salad. the dressing was bland and we ended up taking everything to go. i give it 3 stars because the staff was nice and attentive. probably won't be going back anytime soon.~~#~0
The dining space is very well done and true to what one expects in a Kimpton property.  The cocktail menu is diverse and rather notable in its imaginative mixtures.  The wait staff was attentive and informative.  The menu has a wide variety.  And the food is delicious!  The downside to all of this is the cost.  I have never paid so much for so little.  The quality of the fare does not outweigh the sticker shock here.  The best I can do is give this a 3-star rating because of the pricing. 5 teeny-tiny tacos for $15?  And I do mean teeny-tiny.   The KFQuail is fantastic but you 3X more cornbread than quail.  And the gravy is outstanding.  But there is so little of it there (the quail, that is).  And at $17 no less.  Roasted beet salad and a roasted peach salad for $12 each?  There is barely a half-serving in each.  Don't go by their online menu either because it is out of date in regards to what is offered and what is being charged.  Nearly every item is at least $2 more than shown online.  The best value on the menu are the baby zucchini corn dogs.  5 small dishes, 2 drinks and tip left us $100 poorer.  Great food, lousy value.~~#~0
Was at the Renaissance Hotel in Glendale for a scrapbook convention today. We were starved afterwards and not knowing the area, we stopped here cause it was close!All three of us went for the lunch buffet and their house margarita on the rocks. $9.99 for the buffet and $6.50 for the marg. I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food, but I did enjoy what I ate. Tacos, enchiladas, salad, desert, fruit, a very spicy (to me, which probably wasn't too spicy) carne adovada, beans, rice and a whole bunch of other stuff I ate that I have no idea what it is.  All three of us enjoyed it much!I had flan for the first time. I thought it was good, but didn't have anything to compare it to. The other ladies thought it was tasty too, and they eat it often.Service was great. Thanks goodness my water stayed full. I needed it with the spice.Place is beautiful and has some cool decorations on the outside, like the huge margarita on the roof!~~#~0
Food and drinks are great! Service has been lacking both times I've been here.~~#~0
Chick-Fil-A is one of the fast food chains I will on occasion patronize-A.  You know why?  Because when I have some of their nuggets or strips and a fry I don't feel nauseous and greasy and heavy like I would if I had gone to BK or MCD or most of the other chains.And I really like the waffle fries.  If only Chick-fil-A had some cheese sauce for the fries.  Yum.The quality has been consistent.  So, while the food at Chick-fil-A is kind of bland at least it's decent and doesn't make me feel ill.~~#~0
In the San Francisco area, I have had good Thai and lousy Thai.  This place, by comparison, would count under the former.Thai food, on the whole, isn't really my taste, but my wife and daughter really like it, so I head over to a Thai restaurant every once in a while with them.  As all the curry and coconut milk really doesn't do it for me, I tend to get Thai fried rices, etc. while I'm there.  At The Siamese Cat, the food was good, but did not quite have the complexity that I am used to at the other Thai spots I have been to (in the Bay Area mostly.)  There was nothing whatsoever wrong with the food--it was just not as interesting as other places in my experience.  Less depth of flavor.Would I discourage you from coming here?  Not at all.  Service and atmosphere were very pleasant.  Don't let my snobby tastes give you the wrong impression.  We had a nice meal here and will return sometime.  Give these folks a try.~~#~0
My husband and I ate here for our anniversary.  We had the peppercorn steak, Flemings Potatoes, and a salad.  The food was good but not great. I think we could have split the steak and potatoes and ordered our own salad. We also had two beers and one drink. I ordered a cheesecake to go and they forgot the sauce that went with the cheesecake.  Our bill came to $133.00. Now I'm not sure what part of that experience was worth what we paid. There wasn't anything about the food or the experience that was that spectacular.~~#~0
I swore off Chipotle after my first experience several years ago while living in CA.  I finally gave in and gave it another shot. A buy 1 get 1 free certainly helps!The burrito is average, but the meat is a bit chewy and salty (chicken and beef)  The quality of meat was the problem I had with my previous burrito and not much has changed in the many years since my last visit to a Chipotle. .For similar chain burrito places, Chipotle ranks above Moes, but is behind Baja Fresh, Qdoba etc. Our table had chips and guacamole. The guacamole was excellent!  The staff was very friendly and our burritos were served very quickly.~~#~0
Well, I haven't had anything to eat all day and I thought I would stop in for a burger. My sister in law loves this place but I'm not sure what all of the hype is about!  The fries arent bad but I think I like Red Robin better. Plus, there's no alcohol here! What does a girl have to do to enjoy a beer and a burger?~~#~0
Chile Relleno plate was pretty good here the beans were good the rice was meh. The chips and 2 diff salsa's were good tasted fresh. It didnt take long and Horchata was good! All in all I will stop here again and try some other dishes since its really close to my new pad!~~#~0
I recently stayed here with my wife during New Year's Eve.  We were in town for a wedding at the Biltmore and had a great rate.  The place is fantastic, but the room was a bit disappointing.  The TV had many stations scrambled.  We didn't plan to stay in our room for too long because we wanted to do stuff, but a scrambled channels at The Biltmore is a big negative.  Our shower had trouble draining.  We were only staying two nights so we didn't contact the front desk about it.  The maid didn't come to clean our room until 4:45.  We had wanted to get ready for the 6:30 wedding around that time, so we had to wait nearly 20 mins while she cleaned our room.  We just stayed in the room while she cleaned; awesome.  The next morning, the maid knocked on our around 9:30.  We weren't exactly pleased about that.  All told, a nice place to stay but we were a bit disappointed in a few areas.  I was expecting to be overwhelmed by the venue and service.  I guess my expectations were too high.~~#~0
Family favorite.  Could have a few more salad options on the salad bar.  My very favorite is the broccoli salad. They have some delicious chocolate chip cookies too. Not a big fan of the cheese they use in the foccocia bread. Overall a decent place for lunch or dinner.~~#~0
Enthusiastic employees, open late but very very slow. Sunday @ 9pm, 25min line.~~#~0
I've been trying to get to El Bravo for months, and I finally made it! The atmosphere is pretty cozy and the staff was very friendly. I ordered a green chili burrito with beef and potatoes, and I also ordered a shredded pork taco. The burrito was great. The green chili was a winner in the flavor department. On the contrary though, the shredded pork was pretty bland. It almost tasted like it wasn't spiced at all. It was unfortunate, but it didn't ruin my visit. Lastly, I got to try some of a chicken burrito. I am definitely ordering chicken during my next visit. It was some of the best tasting chicken that I've had at a Mexican restaurant. It was well seasoned and not dried out! I've had so many bad experiences with chicken at Mexican dives that I've pretty much stopped ordering it, but El Bravo will be my exception.I'm going to need to try more, but all in all, El Bravo was pretty good.~~#~0
Um, yeah, Tiffany B., there are 7 Gap stores in the Valley, not 2. But have to agree with w w's review... the place is hit or miss. I can go months and months without finding anything cute at the Gap, then suddenly, they have a cute season... then back to dull and boring.~~#~0
This place is a madhouse! Be prepared to spend a lot of time rummaging through stuff. I would say, have it in your mind what you are going for. I went for purses and shoes. The purses I did not think were marked down enough, most of them were damaged. I did find a cool pair of riding boots, they did not have Uggs in my size. I'll go back again though with a lot of coffee.~~#~0
Trendy, dark, crowded.When I think of Merc Bar, I think "ehhh"It's not bad, just not great enough for me to remember it or frequent it on a regular basis.  The drinks are spendy, but tasty.The sausage and cheese plate is good, but not memorable.Ehh.~~#~0
I went with a group from work.  We had 7 of us.  We were seated pretty quickly.  The menus are huge and lots of things to pick from.  Yeah, I noticed all the dishes are pretty BIG.  The service was quick and pretty good.  I ordered the chicken fingers with fries.  Their batter is little coated and crispy.  The chicken was still moist.  All in all, it was good.~~#~0
When I first starting seeing Dr. Cohen, a couple years ago, I thought she  was "the one." THE doctor I've been looking for. She was patient, thorough, and listened to what I had to say. But lately, it seems those things have tapered off a bit. I can only theorize that it is because she has such an increased patient load. My appointment times have now become just a few minutes. She just sort of flips through my file, and then sends me on my way. On the other hand, her busy schedule has meant that now I can often only see her PA, Sally. In her, I found again all the qualities that I liked in Dr. Cohen -- patience, thoroughness, and time.~~#~0
Very small bar, but they did offer a Greek beer or two which was nice.Flaming cheese and assortment of appetizers was fairly good (hummus, baba, etc.) but pricey.  Falafel was among the worst I've had in the valley - larger balls, but very dry and too dense inside.  Not many other options for those of us who normally stick to falafel.~~#~0
I wish I needed a handbag. Or perhaps a cocktail dress. Because they're loaded with these items. But, my bf is a fashion designer, and we've got an apartment full of such things. And, yes, sometimes I play dress up. Back off. What I do need are some new shirts. I've never realized until recently how conservative the men's selection is here. And how limited. What, they can't get there hands on more than two colors from Hugo. Boss, that is. I just call him Hugo. Like Oprah. And sometimes, I just call her O. Anyway, the men's department is miniscule. Postage stamp sized. I've been in bigger dorm rooms for Sak's sake! Overall, the choices are slim. They have about three different bathrobes to choose from and not much in the skivvie department either. I prefer Needless much more then Slack's. I'm just sayin'...~~#~0
Come on people. What's the obsession about? The burgers are very simple. Do you realize the only thing that makes them different is thousand island sauce? The fries, on the other hand, are very unique and tasty. The malts/shakes are warm (is that possible?). Across the street, a McDouble is only a dollar and the fries are even better (everyone knows that). Plus, their shakes are somehow cold.~~#~0
Why  not another star?....tooo much oil!. Fries come dripping oil! No objection to the fact they have herb Seasoning. The rest, it is just another burger served in a fancy way. All tastes good, but I certainly won't be a client. Service is really nice, and the place is clean and at least you can enjoy your meal, eating with no rush, like it usually happens in the red/orange/yellow colored places.~~#~0
Did you know my home state of Minnesota has more miles of shoreline, due to the over 15,000 lakes, than any other state? Including coastal states. And did you know that Arizona has more boat owners per ca pita than any other state? Red or blue. So obviously we like our water. Naturally Scottsdale and their developers ponied up some dough to revitalize the waterfront. The stinky, stinky waterfront. Ahhh...yes, nothing like the stench of sulfur and sewage as you stroll the shops and eateries with family from out of town. But I have to give them props for linking Fashion Square to Oldtown. Brilliant. We were thre recently and, having never tried Olive and Ivy yet, wow, what a spread they have. Huge doors opening to the patio, overlooking the, er, um, water, river..., well it's a canal. A concrete canal with brown water. For now. Today. Three stars. But I'm an optimist who knows that more landscaping and better architecture are in the near future. Now if only they could install a giant Glade plug in somewhere. Or maybe we can hold a yelp event there with the Febreze people.~~#~0
Ok, so first off let me tell you the oddest thing, they had a fashion show going on while I was there at lunch, at 1pm. I was one of 5 people in the restaurant so I asked the bartender "who are the fashion show'ing for?" He couldn't really tell me, other than they do it every day at lunch time. Odd.The place was ridiculously cool, in a chi chi sort of way. Some counter space in the dining room light up like the 1980's disco dance clubs. They had a big projection screen with a goofy photo montage playing on it, and the bathrooms had pictures of men and women to distinguish between the two rooms. It was over the top "cool" and while some aspects were awesome, others were just plain weird. I can imagine during season, their patio would be THE place to hang out and have wine, overlooking the sewerfront. They even had a mach firepit out there which would be fun.The food I had for lunch was very, very tasty. I had the baby burgers, and they came arranged as a tower, with a chicken burger on the bottom, beef in the middle, and a tuna burger on top. I like tuna so I saved it for last, and turns out it was the only one I didn't love. The other two (chicken and beef) were superb. I'd go back for lunch if I were in the area, and next time I'll check out the scene at night. Should be fun place on a Friday or Saturday night.~~#~0
I tried Jersey Mike's today. The reuben I ordered was on a hoagie style roll rather than regular rye bread.  While a different presentation than expected the sandwich was good.  The sandwich was  otherwise not noteworthy.Service was a little slow but acceptable. If you are in the neighborhood and need a sandwich Jersey Mike's will come through for you.If looking for a great deli experience this is not the place for you.~~#~0
Definitely a place to bring out towners. Fountain show is a must.  But lately all the shops seem to be closed. What's happening to this place. So much potential. Arizona needs a cool attraction like this especially in the west valley. Please don't let this place fade, keep it kicking.~~#~0
This place came higly recommended, and it lived up to the hype in a few areas.  I guess you go here for the atmosphere and not as much for great Italian food.  The prices make up for the lack of great taste.  If you don't pad the bill with a big bar tab, it is really affordable family dining.  Dinner special includes salad, bread, entree and drink.  The entire family made it out the door for under $50, including tip.~~#~0
This stadium is in the middle of nowhere...I came to watch some Minor league game between the Dodgers and the Royals and seriously had a hard time finding their field. From where my GPS took me, it was all the way in the back of a sandy, dusty piece of land. I actually first parked..and then walked to where the Sox were having games. I got situated under a tree where the only shade was available...and then later on realized...shoot. it's not the Royals and the Dodgers. However. i got to score to check out on some really cute players... ha!So i drove and tried to find the Dodgers' area....and unlucky me.... NO SHADE at all. the bleacher seats for watchers isn't covered. It was hell....However....it's definitely more maintained than the Surprise Stadium i think. But please.... have mercy on guests and maybe have some vending machines...~~#~0
It has a Taco Bell inside!!!~~#~0
Maybe it's because I haven't lived in Scottsdale for almost 5 years or maybe it's because LA has so many fantastic restaurants or maybe it was just because it was the night before Christmas Eve, but I was quite disappointed with Canal as a whole.  The food wasn't terrible and neither was the experience, considering I got together with 7 friends I haven't seen in a while.  The place was completely dead and it's hidden so it's not necessarily the easiest to find.  There was just nothing that memorable about the place or the food.  The decor was nice, though we all found it a bit strange that they were playing old black and white movies on the big screen behind us which made the lighting in the place dark at one moment and light  at another.  My friend made a comment that it was annoying, which it was if you had your back to the screen.  As for the food, the parmesan fries were highly recommended so we ordered 2.  They were really good, but I've had better and I wasn't crazy about the dipping sauces it came with - 1 being ketchup (ok, fine it's a classic) and another which was sweet.  I asked for Ranch dressing because it goes best with parmesan fries and they were making it from scratch, which was really nice, but by the time they made it, half the fries were already eaten.  I do have to admit that their homemade ranch was delicious.  For my entree I had the bass in a soy citrus sauce sitting on a bed of white rice with some veggies, such as bok choy.  I thoroughly enjoyed the bass, but I can't say I would ever crave it.  My friend had the veggie tower, which wasn't a tower at all and everything seemed to be fried.  It was ok, but I would never order it.  Another friend had the salmon, which she liked and some other friends had the short ribs, which they also enjoyed.  No one complained about their food, but no one jumped for joy, either.  The staff was really nice, but considering how dead the place was, it took a really long time to get our food and the waitress forgot to put my friend's salad order in so it arrived with the main courses.  Then the waitress asked us if we wanted separate bills.  Since she offered we accepted, which was a huge mistake because it took about 30 minutes to get our checks and she didn't get the right items on the right tabs.  My review may sound really bad, but I don't want to knock the place because the food was good.  It's just that we all expected more and we've all had much better.  I would go again, but maybe not during the holidays...~~#~0
My review of My Big Fat Greek Restaurant may be somewhat skewed because I didn't order the Greek items on the menu that others have reviewed. I went with a friend from work and we each ordered a calzone. Really it isn't that difficult to make a good calzone. I ordered the white pizza calzone and while it was descent, there wasn't anything spectacular that stood out. The outer edges were a bit dry, but it improved once I really got into the pie. My friend ordered the Mediterranian calzone and topped it with a side of marinara (to avoid  the dryness). I had a bite and it was good. We ordered a slice of baklava cheesecake for the road. I think the mistake was not eating it there. By the time we made it back to the office and actually ate it later in the afternoon, it wasn't as good as it would have been upon first presentation. Added to that, my friend tried to split it in half and ended up mangling the portion, so the visual appeal was not there.The atmosphere of the restaurant was nice and the server was very prompt and courteous. I did think that for lunch it was perhaps a little more than a lunch should be. The cheese cake was $5.95 for the slice. The cheesecake, the white pizza calzone and water with lemon was just over $17. With tip I shot my whole $20 on lunch. I wouldn't mind going back and maybe trying something a little more Greek related. But for a calzone, I would find other alternatives.~~#~0
Warrants another visit. We noticed this new restaurant in Gilbert getting a lot of traffic and decided to try it for breakfast this morning. Nice menu and good service. I just had a western omelet and Susan had the oatmeal. Her coffee was cold because they forgot to turn the heater on for the decaf this morning and she wasn't real thrilled with the steel cut oatmeal. Anyway, my omelet was pretty good. They serve Texas toast sized bread for toast which I can do without. Prices are right up there with high end breakfast joints (Denny's not included here). Overall, a good experience and we will probably give it another try. Staff was very friendly and made up for the cold coffee.~~#~0
Alright first things first the Oaxaca burrito is a solid 5 stars but the rest of the menu is mediocre in the taste category with little in appeal beyond just a normal little mexican restaurant. The one on the south side is better than the one up north!!!~~#~0
I swiped my badge at the time clock at roughly 5:32.As I walked wearily down the long gray corridor under the sickening fluorescent lights of my office building I felt overcome with weariness. The bleakness of my 9-5 schedule and the resulting placid evenings were grating on me. I stepped foot outside the building and lit up. The sun was setting, the clouds unfurling and soon the night would fall. I strolled over toward the light rail stop on Priest and Washington, the cigarette had made me queasy and I realized how hungry I was.  I contemplated some greasy tacos and a fat burrito from Fili-B's; semi concious of the direction I was heading, my stomach lead me by the nose- My brain was weakly suggesting tacos, but my stomach had seized power, and in this coup, resistance would be futile. My feet meekly obeyed and stomach was dictating, barking out orders like Idi Amin, 'Falafel!' he demanded. Sami's Gyros was mostly empty around 5:40, save two plump young ladies watching the Cowboys and Red Skins game, and the lone Greek fry cook cleaning his station, the door jingled and he looked up at me from under bushy eye brows, his dark eyes made large by the thick prescription lenses he wore. I walked up to the counter and in a voice not my own, made my order.  "A Falafel sandwich and an order of Hummus!" I demanded, slamming both palms on the counter. The fry cooks eyes bulged even larger and his lips parted, the mustache on his upper lip trembled as he replied "1 falafel sandwich, and 1 hummus plate? cccertainly.." he stammered.I handed a young woman in a pony tail with heaving breasts my atm card, she languidly rang up my order and stared strangely at me. I snatched my receipt from her fingers, turned on my heels and sat regally on a high stool that faced the plaza outside. Occasionally I'd glance at the game, it appeared as if Washington was winning, but I'd never been a football fan, and these teams especially didnt hold my interest.  Before I knew it my order came, the fry cook brought out my hummus first, I devoured it, then he brought my sandwich.  As I sat and greedily ate my sandwich, tzatziki sauce dribbling down my face and fingers, I saw one of my co-workers leaving filiberto's, panic and shame overcame me, I tried to hide my face behind my hulking sandwich, she passed by aloof, thankfully- the last thing I need at work is a new nickname. After I'd satiated my tyrant stomach with Sami's fare, I felt gladdened to know that crappy mexican fast food was not my only after work snack option.~~#~0
I couldn't resist all the banners and balloons this morning so I made my way to the drive through for and early morning treat. I've never really been crazy about Dunkin but thought they are brand new and it's early maybe I'll get something fresh and tasty. I ordered one chocolate-chocolate donut with sprinkles. The girl hands me a bag with a plain cake donut with chocolate icing and sprinkles, no napkins. I had to throw it in reverse and tell her again I wanted a chocolate donut with chocolate frosting and sprinkles. Bag number 2 contains a chocolate donut with chocolate frosting, but no sprinkles and no napkins. The donut was fresh but it's texture was so weird like rubbery spongy cake, it tasted good after the first few bites but gave me the worst heart burn that I had nearly all day despite the heavy does of zantac and 4 bottles of water. Kind of hard to give stars here I don't hate it, I don't love it, but most likely will not be returning. I just think there are better donuts to be had.~~#~0
Dinner for four on a Friday at Sautee. Halibut and steak entrees were excellent. Our waitress was attentive. Problem: something went wrong in the design of this place. It is exceedingly LOUD, like the restaurants in New York City that want to turn tables quickly. Music and conversation left ears feeling like the same as when I walked out of the Judas Priest concert last week.Unless you're in the mood to call audibles at the line to your waiter, pass on this one for dinner.~~#~0
I really really wanted to love this store, and for the most part, I do.Overall, my experience was positive, I've been wanting to visit since it opened in October.However, inconsistencies in customer service really made an impact on me.The Positives:the first three associates were very friendly, said hello, and asked me if I needed anything.When I found a shoe I wanted but was out of stock, a very friendly associate patiently called 3 other stores (their computer service needs to be updated, as many stores listed they had the shoe but when calledthey didn't have it.As soon as he found a pair, a quick exchange of information occured and the shoes are now on its way to my home!The store is beautiful, clean lines and just the right amount of bright color contrasted with the classic "basketball court wood" decor. Like the previous reviewer, it's smaller than other Nike Towns.  They do have a ton of product, yet the store doesn't feel crowded . You still would want to check out Nike.com for the largest selection. Prices are what you'd typically expect for Nike, i'll plunk down money for shoes, but it's a bit harder to pay full price for tshirts and shorts that I can get at a nike factory store (I don't need the clothes to be in the cufrent season). I  liked how the running section had the shoes separated by running style. You would think you'd see this more often, but I don't.The negatives: Why no ACG (their outdoor brand) section? I know they have competiton from REI and other similar stores, but many nike folks have borderline crazy brand loyalty, I'm sure they would buy that stuff up.Considering the aforementioned associates above, many other associates seemed a bit aloof, the store was not busy at all, but some associates simply did not say hello.  I don't need 5 star treatment, but it's a bit awkward when we are right in the vicinity of eachother and the associate doesn't say hello.  Perhaps i'm being nitpicky.  Did I look inaccessible? I sure hope not.  I'm willing to chalk it up to the store being pretty new.i'll be back.~~#~0
This nail salon is ok, but don't go here expecting a real 'spa' experience. I went here today with a couple of friends to get pedicures as the salon is close to where we live and convenient for all of us. We made appointments and did not have to wait, so that was a positive. One of my friends' man who did her toes was really friendly and personable, but my guy was not. Mine was a younger man, and he did a nice job, but he gave a pretty weak massage and was texting and watching tv throughout the pedi. Not really the best experience, but my toes came out nice and my little toe design turned out cooler than my friends (sorry guys!) so he gets props for that. I felt like for a newer salon, the massage chairs weren't the best and a lot of the 'fun' nail colors offered were in off brands (not OPI or China Glaze)...which makes me wary to try them. A basic pedi was 22$ and the nail design was 5$, so it is fairly reasonable, but I don't know if I would go back because I had a better experience at a different salon (nails 8000) for around the same price.~~#~0
Vacation time spent by a trip to see the family is generally rife with compromises. After failing to produce an agreement on anything we all really wanted, we ended up at the somewhat unfortunately named BJ's Brewhouse.I half expected to see gaggles of teenage boys and tweenage girls (of roughly the same maturity level) stifling giggles about what "BJ" might stand for, but did not. The other half expected the food to be disappointing and for me to be already longing for some good Szechuan before I'd been in Arizona 2 hours, and pleasantly did not experience that either. Standard chain decor, standard chain service, standard ratio of operational to non-operational men's room stalls (non-zero.)We opted for the stealth $20 email special of a shared medium pizza (any specialty or number of toppings), a shared "pizookie" dessert and individual soup or salad which I would strongly recommend since normally a specialty pizza itself is $20.The starter? Minestrone with a bit of cheese. Italian. Adequate. Unremarkable.The pizza? A paradoxically Chicago-style Southwestern, like a chain boutique version of Pizza Hut. Solid crust, great by Seattle standards (low.)The dessert? A very thin (Peanut Butter, among the 5+ varieties) cookie in a pancake-sized tin topped with vanilla ice cream. I was more preoccupied with whether Madame K's Pizza Brothel, er, Bistro in Seattle copied the Screaming Orgasm from them or vice-versa (and thinking they would have been better off to copy BJ's pizza) than the experience of the sweet cookie.The verdict? For optimizing any particular aspect, one could do better elsewhere, but the pizza is quite good among mostly forgettable accompaniments. Chains are generally compromise candidates, and in that vein, BJ's Brewhouse performs the job.~~#~0
I called in on Christmas Eve morning to see if there was a wait. The lady who answered said I could get right in with no wait. i got there 10 minutes later and the waiting room was full of puking kids and people hacking up all kinds of strange things. I was there for an injured foot, not really wanting to catch whatever was floating around in the air. It took almost 40 minutes for them to call me back. They immediately took an X-ray and the technician was great. I sat in the exam room for about 15 minutes waiting for the doctor to tell me my results. She came in and said she likes to meet her patients before looking at their bones. I thought that was nice. They filled my prescription right there, so I avoided the trip to the pharmacy. If in need an Urgent care again I would probably head back here...but wearing a surgical mask.~~#~0
Our family of four (parents and two kids) joined another family of four for Spring Break I was expecting crowds, but it was very tranquil.  Moms and dads were able to relax in the poolside sun with food and drinks while the kids played in the pool and two hot tubs nearby.   Wish the pool was warmer though.  Great location with lots of restaurants nearby.  Hotel food was delicious.  Really enjoyed the breakfast  and the smoothies and great service at the restaurant bar.  Loved the rooms and the decor.  The gym was small, but had apples, water and a nice view of the pool.  Overall, the staff was friendly and we would return.   Just a few grumps.Only 3 stars for several reasons:  We requested a poolside room on a high floor and were given a view of the street.  Checked in very late so we didn't even notice until we woke up the next day, but by then the kids were all unpacked and sprawled out so we gave up the battle.  Also, we checked in very late (around 11 pm), but the front desk refused to give us a late checkout on the backend without charging us an extra $30.  We ended up packing and moving our bags a few doors down to our friends' room because they were given a free late checkout by another staffer -- guess it depends on who who ya get.  Inconsistent rules.  Couldn't understand why they were being so difficult, especially since it was a Tuesday and the hotel was hardly full. Hubby and I joked that they must be rushing us out because people were clearly clamoring for our street side room.  :-) .  Another reason for 3 stars:  Pool Service the first day was slow.  Only one woman servicing the entire pool of about 15-18 people.  She came around every once in a while, but we found ourselves waiting a lot and trying to track her down.  Second day was much better.  About 3-4 poolside servers who were overly attentive and passed out popsicles to everyone. We also used the hotel babysitting service and she was awesome.   The parents were able to have a nice, adult dinner while the kids all crashed from their fun in the sun back in the room.  Overall a good experience.~~#~0
If you want to understand the meaning of eating unbelievably spicy foods in a horrendously hot environment to actually make your body feel cooler, than you should come here to eat.  We came here with a couple of friends while we were in a somewhat adventurous mood.  I don't typically love spicy food, but I am definitely a fan of the cajun/jerk style of spicy.  I ordered some sort of jerk chicken pasta dish, but I can't remember the name.  The chicken was a tiny bit dry and the pasta was a tad overcooked, but nothing that would ruin a dish.  Unfortunately for me, the jerk part of it was so incredibly spicy that after a couple of bites I was sweating profusely and my nose insisted on running while I was trying to eat.  It was literally so hot I could only take a couple more bites without tears coming out of my eyes.  Now I know that I am a bit of a wuss when it comes to spicy, but I can handle some heat.  This was just a full on inferno that you expect only from hell.All that being said, I did feel cooler on a particularly hot AZ day.  I didn't hate the food, it was just too spicy for me.  If you love spicy, this is your place.  If you don't, well, I don't suggest you order anything with the word jerk in the description.~~#~0
Hidden in a random strip mall, there's a good chance plenty of people pass Dukes without realizing that they are missing out. Now, this is a dive bar so like all other dive bars, you have to take it for what it is. The floors could be shinier, the bathrooms could be cleaner, but then it wouldn't be an authentic dive bar would it?Duke's is a solid choice when looking for a place to play some bar games, watch sports and enjoy some drinks. It's spacious and great for large groups. You name the game, they've got it: several pool tables, darts, shuffle board, Foosball, etc. TVs line the walls with your favorite sport teams playing. With the reasonably priced drinks, this is a good place to pregame before a sporting event or set up shop and watch it on TV. I've hosted a party at Dukes and it's a perfect location because of the size, TVs, games and most importantly, because they don't charge to rent out the party room. So, you can have up to 100 people in a party room without any fees! And, for a girl on a budget trying to throw a low key party, this was a perfect choice. So I suggest Dukes if you are looking for a dive bar night on the town and you don't want to just sit around when you get there.~~#~0
Perfectly good for fast food.  Head and shoulders above the standards, and on par with the new breed of modern quick casual burger concepts.  The location is new and clean with plenty of parking, and the staff is efficient and friendly.  The menu is also fairly small and simple, which I prefer, and prices are very reasonable.The food itself is just okay.  The burger is alright.  For something that's "charred" it lacked a grilled flavoring.  The bun was also a little stale.  The fries are very plain.  There was barely any texture to them, and no seasoning, not even salt.  They literally were just fried potatoes.  Could have used at least a touch of salt.  At least they weren't greasy.  I'll give Habit Burger props for the pepper bar.  That is awesome and different.I also don't know if I dig the pager or not.  While it's nice to not hear someone saying "order #x is ready" every thirty seconds, I hate having something extra to hold while I wait for food.This location is fairly close to my office, and was worth a try while driving to work.  I definitely wouldn't recommend going out of your to give it a try, but if you're in the area, why not taste something new?~~#~0
I can't believe I haven't written my review on 1130 yet! I had a very nice happy hour with my pal Heather C here. We met before going to watch a performance at the Herberger. The weather was really nice so I was glad that Heather chose a patio table. Our waiter was a kid. I mean, I know I'm getting older, but he was a clumsy kid who fumbled through the drink specials and needed some sharpness. With such a cool sleek spot, you would probably want a more professional waiter. Just my opinion. We decided on the lobster lettuce cups that were rather large and surprisingly full of lobster meat! I really liked the appetizer, I was wishing for more acid but it was still refreshing and tasty. We took our waiter's suggestion and ordered the calamari. What a surprise! I really liked the calamari! It came drizzled with a sweet chili sauce and had pepperocinis tossed into the mix.It was great! I loved how the sweetness of the calamari meat, and the chili sauce played well with the tanginess of the pepperocinis! I had some kind of peach martini that was WAY too sweet for my taste, but I guess for a girly drink it was ok. I hope that next time we'll have more time to linger and maybe even have dinner. I look forward to trying their other offerings.~~#~0
the OLD spaghetti factory is by far my guiltiest pleasure. lets face it the food isn't that great, and on more then 5 occasions i have been here and it seemed like the entire bussing staff was on a smoke break.growing up in the willo district as a child my mother took me to the Spaghetti factory alot. i remember sitting in the trolly and the entire 86-88 suns team was in the building "helping" out. signing autographs and what not. sure was fun as a kid.now that i'm older i just have those memories to make me say this place isn't all bad. the mizthra cheese and butter on some noodles is still delish. the meat sauce is decent to great. the pesto ranch dressing is pretty good..to bad the lettuce is either still soaking wet, or dry and disgusting. as a phoenix institution for decades i wish this place was better. maybe someday someone will come in and turn it around..but as a "chain" restuarant i don't see that happening. either way..for nostalgia i'll still eat here on a quirky whim. but i will not go out of my way to eat here.~~#~0
As much as I respect Michael C.'s reviews, I'm not going to give Grazie 4 - 5 stars just because.  The last time my wife and I visited Grazie, we received terrible, unattentive service, and a soggy, less-than-tasty Margherita pizza.  And I'm not trying to exaggerate either - we actually wanted to send the pizza back.I love the idea of a small, nearby, locally owned pizzeria like Grazie, so we'll probably try going there again.  The atmosphere is just what I want a dinner place - dark and intimate - but they have to have good food and service, too.~~#~0
Pane Bianco represents the gentrified hipsters paradise. This place just secretes the undeserved smug vibe. Besides the hipster crew, get ready to meet the world traveler who is yakking it up about his travels across the American Southwest and how he pities America right now... or the overwhelmed Scottsdale mom with the 2 bratty kids, but she's completely ignoring them. You certainly see a melody of personalities at Pane Bianco. While I certainly never judge a place by it's appearance or it's customer base (I love holes in the wall), there was just something about Pane Bianco that rubbed me the wrong way... and it got a little more interesting when I ordered my meal.I ordered the Tuna sandwich, which comes with red onion, Gaeta olives, lemon and arugula. This all comes on what I believe is ciabatta bread, but I'm not sure. I asked the lady behind the counter if I could sub out the olives for the roasted peppers. Her answer was simply "No".... In my mind my first thought was "okay, maybe a place like this doesn't do substitutions", which I understood. She told me that they won't put the peppers on the tuna because it wouldn't work with the sandwich. I was shocked... so I asked her nicely to please ask someone if they could do it. After waiting around for awhile, I went to pay for my meal. As my sandwich was being wrapped, she said yes they could do it, but for some large fee (I believe 2.50 or 3 dollars, remind you this is an 8 dollar sandwich). By this time I was pretty worn out of the whole experience of Pane Bianco that I just said no thanks and went to eat my sandwich. Thanks, but a little too late.Granted the sandwich was pretty good, and the tuna was very fresh. I just couldn't believe that someone would tell me that I couldn't get something on the menu put on my sandwich... for the reason that she didn't believe they went together. I spent much of my childhood in South Philadelphia living on homestyle Italian... and tuna and peppers definitely do go together...In summary, I will try Pane Bianco again, and will most likely update my review based off of the service I receive. The sandwich was very good, and is the main reason I will go back. Hopefully I have a different experience.~~#~0
Food is good - student prepared, fresh, and local. Folks, they maintain their own garden. Very reasonably priced. Nice people. Consistent preparation. Panini station is a treat.~~#~0
My employer had their company Christmas party here this past Friday.  Let's start with the only downside to having the party here, the food.  While it is hard to complain about free food, I will.  It was a buffet with nothing good going for it.  Enough said,  The rest of the experience was excellent.  We bowled and it was so fun (and funny) at times.  And we were each provided with game cards so I was able to drive race cars and pretend shoot things, awsome.   I won a bunch of tickets on other games and caught a stuffed bear in a claw game.  Everyone seemed to have fun.   Now I do believe that there are some people who believe themselves to be too old to enjoy video games and bowling, but not me or my coworkers.  We all had a blast.  So you have to let out your inner child to fully enjoy this type of venue.  I have no idea how much money I would have spent had it not been covered by my employer.    I imagine it would have been about $50 plus with all that was included.  Nice, clean place to play some games.~~#~0
This Costco is soooooo busy...."HOW BUSY IS IT?"This Costco is so busy..... the other day I actually googled "the busiest Costco in America" and guess what!? It's not the busiest one :( The busiest Costco is in Seattle.Had you going there for a second didn't I?That's why this costco gets 3 stars from me. I've been going here for years now and no matter when I go the whole place is like a buddhist 's nightmare. Total anarchy.  And the managers are ALWAYS huddled up at the end of the lines of shoppers acting like "what do we do now...there are lots of people here today" AND they stopped selling single turkey crosandwitches with a side cesar! All they have in the deli section now is 10 lb. meatloaf trays and some giant tubs of greasy penne that they try to market as "pasta salad". WTF!!! I guess I just have to go out and find myself a huge family to justify buying anything fresh. On a positive note, the dog food, water and coffee are pretty good.~~#~0
The place was cute (I can't comment on authenticity, because I'm as white as they come) and the strip mall was a typical strip mall, not intimidating whatsoever. The food was satisfactory. My friend and I had crispy tofu to start, I had the Hot and Spicy noodles with tofu and my friend had the Ginger Tofu. We were both incredibly happy with the way the tofu was cooked - it was ACTUALLY crispy - but just thought the sauces and veggies were "meh."I would be willing to try here again for one of their curries. I'm not sure when I will make it back to Siam Thai; the distance is a little to far to drive for a mediocre meal.~~#~0
I first visited for Get Your PHX and now visit once a month to attend the University of Arizona College of Medicine lectures.  I love the patio when the weather cools off.  It's clearly popular with its regulars, and it's nice to see a business succeed at this location.I do wish there were fewer fried appetizers and more items for people who don't eat fried food (out of the bar).  But then I'm a nutritionist for a living...a spectrum of choices may not be what the majority of people who keep this place in business are looking for.~~#~0
***Chase Field's main concession stand Double Headers features a value menu that includes hot dogs, corn dogs and popcorn for $1.50 each; the concessions here are similar to what you will find at any other stadium, but the lower prices are refreshing***Double Headers is the main concession stand at Chase Field.  They have multiple locations all throughout the stadium, which make them very easy to find.  They serve the traditional baseball stadium food like hot dogs, french fries and popcorn.  There are some items that are only available at some of the Double Headers stands though (like the nachos).  I am not sure, but I think some of the Double Headers also sell a foot-long corn dog.Double Headers does provide one big advantage over many arena/stadium concessions stands.  They have a value menu that features items like hot dogs, corn dogs and popcorn for $1.50 each.  We went with the popcorn and it was okay.  It was not super light or super fresh, but it was perfectly serviceable.  It was a decent size too.  That size of popcorn would probably run about $4 at a movie theater concessions stand.We also went with the nachos, which were corn tortilla chips topped with jalapenos and a side of melted nacho cheese.  The chips were the kind of hearty gold tortilla chips that you would get from a grocery store.  They were crunchy, but they were not the freshest chips.The jalapenos were good and the nacho cheese here was better than what you would find at most arenas/stadiums.  The nacho cheese had a little bit of spice and heat to it.  That is rare for stadium cheese dips.  Usually, stadium cheese dips are very bland.Service was fine.I like trying more city/team-specific concessions when visiting a new stadium and there is a good number of them at Chase Field (local chains like Macayo's and Streets of New York pizza).  Double Headers, on the other hand, is very run-of-the-mill concessions.  Still, the value menu here makes Double Headers a good option if you are a stadium regular or are looking to get some food without having to spend too much money.~~#~0
So we hit this spot as part of the Spring Fling Pub Crawl last night. It's suuuuuuch a nice bar, great place to have a cocktail at. The decor was very city-modern-sleek, it could easily fit right into NYC. The drinks were well priced, I personally had good service so no complaints from me. Two of the other pub crawlers that were near us at the bar could not get a drink to save their lives, and one of the bartenders was a bit rude to one of the girls trying to get a drink. Now I will say that it was suuuuuper busy in there, but that's still not cool. I'll definitely go back, looking forward to trying some of their food.~~#~0
This place is an effing Scottsdale poop-stain that charges a cover and makes people wait in line even when they're only at 25% capacity.We went in. Experienced the retardedness of Martini Ranch for 5 minutes. Left. Except for the time we stayed and had a great time. Caveat-- when I'm completely sh!t-faced and with friends, I can have a great time just about anywhere.Save your time.Save your money.Go somewhere else.~~#~0
Went for the 1st time it was pretty busy for lunch on a Monday (considering its fairly new) owners were active in and out of the kitchen, which is always nice to see. Had some good lunch options for a reasonable $8 (comes with small salad and side of rice) I disliked the nickel and dimeing. I added egg rolls and an iced tea and ended up with a just shy of $18 bill... for lunch!! The food was good though. And it's one of the ONLY vegan options within a 5 mile radius of my house that's not a fancy sit down joint. So I'll definitely return. Happy Eating!!!~~#~0
This place is decent if you have the patience and stamina to dig through and look through everything.  You definitely need to be in a shopping mood.Yes, you'll find some great deals, but I think a lot of the items are returns from the stores such as Nordstrom.  If you look at the bottoms of the shoes, they definitely looked like they've been worn before.  However, they're still in great condition and for most people, worth the bargain price.  My girlfriends bought a ton of designer shoes at extremely low prices (ie Jimmy Choos for $100).As for clothing, you can find some pretty cheap stuff, but again, I think most, not all, are items that have been returned or have defects (ie holes, missing belt).  So look at the clothes carefully before purchasing.  There are no returns.This is definitely not a place for all, but for die hard bargain hunters this might be worth checking out.~~#~0
"Great variety of dim-sum, very crowded Chinese restaurant and good price! 3/5I have been to Golden Buddha for at least a dozen times in the past 3 years. I have mix feeling about it... it is NOT CONSISTENT in its food quality and service. Most of time we had very good selection in dim-sum and the food was just good. After a few times of trial and error, we figured that you need to go there on the weekends. They usually have fresh and better selection of dim-sum during the weekends and the service is faster. Yes, you might need to wait for a bit but it's worth your money. :) We will definitely go back there for some more dim-sum!~~#~0
Solid 3.5 StarsI've been here more times than I can count, but not as many times as I have gone to Seamus' brother bar, The Turf.   I have eaten and been a slight bit tipsy at both places.  What I am not fond of here is the bottle neck at the bar area....try getting in and out of here on even a semi busy night...and unless you are sitting at a table or find a spot to order at the bar you shall remain drinkless.  Thus I prefer this place after work during the week and I tend to avoid super busy nights like First Fridays or St Patricks.  [I lie I enjoyed the trolly they had set up to take patrons back and forth last year between Turf and Seamus for St Patties].The food is good but not great. The beer is cold and when you have a seat (at the bar or table) the service is usually good.~~#~0
Nothing's of much grandeur in the aviation industry anymore. Anyone who doesn't purchase a first class seat might as well expect abysmal service, why let yourself be surprised? First of all, US Airways isn't ACTUALLY operating "US Airways" style. They're owned and operated by America West, which has always been notorious for nickeling and diming their passengers. Pre-merger, this used to be a somewhat respectable airline. However, as business progressed, America West has inflicted US Air and it's subsidies with "America West Business" - overcharging for everything but the seats. (But there's an exception to even that rule...) America West clearly had no idea of the sheer size of the combined new airline they had created. Flights have been continually late, cancelled, and overbooked. Planes are rapidly aging. On US Air Express Jets the America West logo is still quite intact. A lack of business has caused US Air to pull out of hundreds of gates, making airports ghost towns. So don't blame US Air, blame America West. Anyway...I've flown both America West & US Air a fair amount. US Air internationally isn't nearly as painful as a domestic flight. Since it's neck  and neck with Southwest, their standards have been mainly homogenized. Except US AIR CHARGES 60 DOLLARS TO CHECK TWO BAGS! Are you kidding me?! No wonder you're going out of business! Southwest cares about it's customers, even if it does pack them in like cattle. As soon as US Air takes the money out of your pocket, the service you paid for is up for grabs- there's no guarantee whether you'll get it or not. Though US Air does offer assigned seating and I do like that a lot. I can't say I'm fond of rushing to the plane to get the best possible seat. Flew US Air last night for the hundredth time. Had to fight myself to not buy Almonds...but at $3 they probably weren't worth it. Flight attendants were both friendly and positive. Definitely raised my morale throughout the flight. Flight was a few minutes early, so that was a plus. Things generally run pretty smoothly, at least out of Phoenix anyway. They're definitely doing something right out of Sky Harbor. So I'm not going to complain. It's an airline, they're all the same more or less. It usually gets you where you need to go, and you're not paying $400-$500 dollars like you would on Northwest or United. Take the good with the bad. If you absolutely can't stand lousy service and expensive fees, or you're just looking to get from A to B, there's always another airline to choose from.~~#~0
Went here last Monday for the Yelp Office hours :-). The salads looked amazing (they will even turn a sammich into a salad if you ask), especially the Caprese salad Lynn W got. Despite the look of  lots of wine they also had lots of empty rows :-/.  I was full from Zinc so the only things I ate were a small piece of fudge and a bite of a raspberry macaroon.. both were delicious. It was fun finally meeting some of the Az yelpers in person after following their reviews for a few years. Overall not a bad place to shop if you are in the area.~~#~0
Great Wall provides a large menu and a clean dining room with a lot of seating. There are two sections for seating in the Dim Sum area. I was ordering off the lunch menu and chose to sit separately. The menu provides a lot large selection of typical Chinese food. I didn't see a General Tso (my favorite) option on the lunch menu, but I went with Sesame Chicken.  The lunch special was $5.50 and included an egg flower soup, egg roll with mustard and sweet & sour dipping sauces, rice, and a good portion of chicken. It was crisp and had a good flavor, but was a little bit salty. A server came by with a cart asking if I wanted dessert. There were several options available, but I did not select any (I wasn't sure if it was included or extra, so I passed).All in all, Great Wall was a good and low-priced, good service option for a Chinese food. The staff was fast and friendly. With most restaurants in the area being Mexican, this is a good place to get quick Chinese.~~#~0
If you are looking for that cozy coffee house where you can shmooze with friends for hours, while drinking terrific coffee and eating mouth watering pastries, this is not you place.To me, the acid test (pun intended!) for a coffee house is how good the coffee is.   I mean the unadulterated, drip coffee -- you know, the real thing.    Royal passed this test!   The coffee is hand brewed.    The blend has a touch of espresso that gives it a European flair.    In short, the coffee is really good.   So the "drinking terrific coffee" part is there.But the array of noshes is limited to 3 choices.   A cupcake.   A muffin.   A scone.   In contrast to the above mentioned hand brewed coffee, the muffin I tried tasted processed.   And not fresh at all.   The space isn't comfy-cozy.   So you may not want to sit for hours, sipping, reading, and shmoozing.But if all you want is a great cup of freshly brewed coffee, perhaps To-Go, then Royal At the Biltmore is your place.~~#~0
Nice menu. Nice clean ambiance. The food is just okay. My recent experience was the chicken enchilada lunch special which was served tepid. It should be hot. The chicken was canned and it reminded me of tuna. The whole thing didn't sit well with me. I'll go back in a pinch, but I'm not gonna race back.~~#~0
I had the "double charburger" with cheese, mayo and lettuce only, a side of sweet potato fries and a coffee ice cream shake. Total was $10 and some change.The burger was really good and juicy and reminded me a lot of Fatburger in both presentation and taste. The shake was also pretty good - says right on the side that they use real ice cream. It wasn't very strong in coffee flavour, though, and had no real coffee in it (that would be something to entice me to order it again). The fries were good but far from the best sweet potato fries I've had. There was hardly any seasoning. They should try battering or glazing them to make them stand out. They were much tastier than their regular fries, though - those were limp, tasteless and boring.  It was a decent meal and fun to try but I'm not sure if it was worth the $10+ dollars I spent.~~#~0
I have been to this place many, many times and have had great times here. The only reason I knocked two stars off was simply because of one particular occurrence that happened last time and I can't get it out of my mind: a bunch of hair in the bath tub/shower, which was totally revolting. Okay, onto the good. The pool is great. It's so nice to lounge around, The service is pretty good except for whenever I put my flag on the lounge chair they take forever to pay attention so, I have to end up getting up and get the drink myself- really not a huge deal, I'm just saying. I'm there to relax! The rooms are usually really clean and that's why I was surprised to see the clump of hair at the bottom of the bathtub last time. I'm sure I will be back to this location, but like the Pointe Squaw Peak location better for sure.~~#~0
I am so glad I found this place close to work. When you are sick of everything and can't figure out what you want, Greek Gyros is there to solve all your problems (okay, maybe just those of the hunger kind). The gyros are great and PACKED with meat for a reasonable price. I can't get enough of the tzaziki. Co-workers have really enjoyed their salads as well (the "pick-a-meat" with grilled chicken). I must include a dehydration alert, though. Every time we get gyros in the office we all find that we're guzzling water for the rest of the day... that darned meat must be solid sodium!~~#~0
Went there with a few guys from work a little bit ago (Sorry i forgot to Yelp it :+( ) One of the guys was hyping this place up like there is no tomorrow, so naturally i was excited to go. Boy, was i disappointed. No, no! I knew its a big chain place. And i did not have my expectations jacked up through the roof despite my friend's hype. but boy, ohh boy it was even less exciting then i was expecting. Its hard to describe exactly what is wrong about it, but wrongness is just there. You know what i mean? Its just not as .... succulent? I do not know.Its just not all that great and i am not interested to come back there. "I like! NOT"~~#~0
Great bartenders.  Drinks are reasonably priced and can deliver some kick.  Was there to see some shows, great acts.  The downside is that the "Jester Room" where the acts perform would be a great venue (close to stage, lots of fun etc) but there were continual audio problems.  I felt horrible for the bands who clearly were frustrated.  I wish the bar had a decent sound system/sound guy who was in charge and more attentive.Warning:  The bathrooms are horrendous.  Several people commented that they have seen bathrooms in 3rd world countries that were kept in better shape.~~#~0
This is the best Greek food I've found in AZ.  Try their lamb kabobs, or lamb chops and Tzatziki and pita bread. Nice waiters, too! Good stuff!~~#~0
Like Arlin, I'm super happy to see another great place open at Norterra.We went here with another couple and their children.Great menu...and it's really very well appointed.We had some slow service, but I'm attributing this to it being new.They really seem to be trying to get things right.Took a while for our drinks to be refreshed and to place our order-and the seating process seemed to take longer than necessary.I'm sure within a couple of months things will be running smoothly.We'll be back.~~#~0
I can't say it's the best sub sandwich I've ever had, but it was good.My little cutie pie and I met my hubby here for lunch.  Hubby had the sliced to order #6 Roast Beef Special he really liked.  It was huge with all the veggies, oil and vinegar.  I had the #17 Philly Cheesesteak, not bad.  I've learned my lesson not to order a kid's meal just because often times lesser quality meat is substituted.  Maybe not here, but I didn't want to take a chance.  He got the mini turkey with provolone, a good size for a mini.  He had to eat the other half later on in the afternoon.They get really busy here, so go before noon, if you want a table!~~#~0
All the teas are delicious here - the herbal caramel apple is one of the most amazing teas I have ever had (and I consider myself a "tea person").  All their other teas are stellar too and they will sell it to you in 8oz quantities. Protip: After 3pm their blended green tea (like a smoothie/frappucino thang) is only $2 for a giant one!Something that drives me bonkers about this place is that they refrigerate their desserts. Cakes should not be refrigerated. I understand putting leftover cake in the fridge at the end of the day, but during opening hours they should just be in a pastry case.  If I am ordering a slice "for here" I want to be able to eat it NOW and not let it sit on my table for half an hour to defrost.  That said, the desserts look divine (edible glitter - heck yeah!!) but only taste mediocre and on the dry side.~~#~0
I don't know what it is about Herb 'n Flavors, but every time I go there something is off.    Don't get me wrong, overall they have some tasty dishes, but some others fall flat.  It's really hit or miss.  The first time I got the Spinach 4-Cheese Quesadilla and it was just too greasy and cheesy.  I know, I know it's "4-cheese", but there is a delicate balance with cheese.  My friend ordered it another time and the balance was much better.  The second time I went I got the Veggie Rice Bowl.  Wonderful seasoning, but they overcooked the tofu.  We also ordered the Vegan Spinach & Artichoke Dip.  No thanks.  My friend had the salmon - loved it.  My other friend got the Pollo Fresca and the Chicken Shawarma Wrap separate times.  He liked both. The 3rd time I ordered the Veggie Bowl without the tofu (much better).  The falafel fries are yummy.  The tiramisu is absolutely INCREDIBLE!  I must say the owner is really personable and KNOWS how to cater to his customers.  That type of treatment will keep me coming back for the things that I really enjoy.~~#~0
I went to Steve's as part of the @downtownphoenix spring fling pub crawl.It has a nice atmosphere, and I love the patio.We were only there for about 30 minutes, but in that time, I was pleased with the level of service we received, and with the chips and salsa.The chips are kinda different, almost like fried wontons in their texture. They were delicious. And the salsa had a nice flavor, and decent heat.I was hoping to have breakfast after the crawl, but I was too exhausted (old) and had to head home long before that happened.I will definitely go back to Steve's, and especially to try their breakfast menu.(only 3 stars because I didn't get enough time or food experience yet)~~#~0
Chili was awesome... Good toppings bar but nothing out of the ordinary. Burger was moist & well cooked but without seasoning. Great chocolate shakes!~~#~0
good o'l reliable starbucks...would be nice if the regular coffee was just as strong as the ones in the stores.  but good enough.  free refills too!!!  so don't forget to ask.  nice employees.~~#~0
If you have low expectations, you will enjoy this hotel. Friendly, helpful staff. Rooms are outdated and dark. When I made reservations, was told that wifi was free - not the case - 9.95/day. Generally enjoy staying at Hyatt Regency hotels but would not stay again.~~#~0
ATMOSPHERE: Dimly lit. Classical style decor. High ceilings with neat looking light fixtures. Crowded on a Saturday night. Crowd was mostly elderly but I also saw a family dining there with kids. Patio and indoor dining available. FOOD: We ordered:1. Complimentary bread - already garnished with garlic butter and herbs. Crusty, white bread. It was tasty.2. Escargo - first time I've ever had this! Very heavily doused in butter. It tasted like butter.... with consistency of mushrooms.... nothing spectacular.3. Shrimp fettuccine with cream sauce - wow... this is soooooo heavy. Almost tooo creamy. It was overwhelming. I prefer something a little lighter. 4. Seafood special - tomato based sauce with mussels, clams, white fish, shrimp, squid. Nice flavors but nothing spectacular.PRICES: Entrees run ~$20 and up. Appetizers ~$10 and up. Extensive wine list.SERVICE: Spectacular. No complaints here. PARKING: Plenty available in the shopping center parking lot.CONCLUSION: Wasn't too impressed with the food... maybe should have tried the ravioli and gnocchi that everyone raves about. Great ambience and service though.~~#~0
I've tried this burger and fries plenty of times. Still not that exciting... Burger is good but you can have the fries. Service is always friendly.~~#~0
I love Thai food so much & Malee's has always been my FAVE. However, the last two times I've been in there it's just been... OK.The service is usually bad. I recommend take-out.~~#~0
A frequent spot for lunch when I worked around 7 Ave and McDowell. My favorite is the chicken pita #2 which is a pita jammed with chicken breasts, feta, grilled onions and fresh veggies. Sure there are sandwiches and salads but I can make those at home. Let there be meat!Tips:Choose fruit or pasta.Ask very politely for pita chips instead.If you are retarded and can't build a sandwich, try Sack's.Place cake into mouth, not onto face.~~#~0
I really like this place, it sure beats Olive Garden. The menu is pretty simple and straightforward, basic pasta dishes and a few other options.You get plenty of food, soup or salad, your entree and desert for a decent price. Of course, this isn't authentic Italian food or anything, just really good pasta.The interior is rustic, lots of seating and room in this hardwood floored refurbished old house. The decorations are old family photos and playbills.But be warned, don't expect to be in and out in an hour for lunch. Service is slow for whatever reason. I learned after a few times that an hour and a half was the norm for lunch.~~#~0
It's all about the sizzle, not the steak, at PVBC.The burger itself is small and not very flavorful, if you get just a burger and apply pedestrian toppings. There was a bun - not much to say about it.They're doing a neat thing with the fancy toppings, but when you consider overall value of what you get for your money, combine that with the hype, consider what you can get elsewhere, it's just not worth what you pay.For the more mathey, that equation looks like this: $V = ( q+h )  { c   *or: dollar value of quality plus hype is less than competition* no 'less than' symbol for yelp text fields, how lame~~#~0
With the exception of the tortillas, this place is pretty run-of-the-mill for Mexican food in Phoenix.~~#~0
I, like others, really want to like Mary Coyle's more than I actually do. It's cute. Homedone interior, mostly shades of pink. Horrible floral border along the edge to the ceiling. Unframed prints - trios of sundaes and fading Norman Rockwells... unsteady booths. Astrobright pink menu of overpriced options.I love that they have peppermint ice cream in June.  We went for the ice cream cookie sandwich; the menu said allow extra 10 minutes for that, presumably so they could make the cookies. Unfortunately, we got it back within minutes to a hard, old, unappetizing premade cookie instead. That was a bummer.~~#~0
i can't believe it took me so long to finally try Ted's.pretty straightforward hot dogs, i got a regular hot dog with a side of cheez (not CHEESE, because it was liquefied and nuclear orange) and a side of chili. i thought it was pretty good, the chili was a little oily, but fairly tasty.  the cheez could have come from circle k for all i know, it was REALLY thick though. like my spoon stood up in it thick.the fries and onion rings are pretty darn tasty too. i didn't ask for ranch, i'm not sure if they have it. i'm going back, so i'll find out!hit the spot!~~#~0
Food was good. Clam chowder was too runny and lacked clams. Service was friendly but slow after the initial order. Perhaps I'll sit inside next time.I'll be back, but not before I try a few other places in the area..~~#~0
The stars I'm giving this place are for the food only. The chips and salsa were okay. I had their chicken poblano enchiladas and they were really ,really tasty. I went with my dad for his birthday because this is one of his favorite places to eat. I enjoyed the patio atmosphere also and hope the next time I'm in Arizona to eat here again. The only problem I have with  the place is that the service was awful. Seriously, the worst. I would give the service 1 star or LESS .The waiter acted as though he was distracted the whole time. He never re-filled our chips. It took over 20 minutes to bring us our drink order (diet soda and ice tea) and we never got re-fills on our drinks either. He barely made contact with us to take our order. Thankfully I didn't have any questions for him because I'm not sure he would have stopped to answer them if I had. They were busy but only with a Sunday crowd. We didn't go on a weekend night when I expect delays and distracted waiters. This was at 5:00 on a Sunday. Thankfully their food is good and the atmosphere is nice because otherwise I wouldn't recommend this place based on service alone.I just saw on some other yelper's review that chips and salsa are only free the first round. REALLY?  Maybe I won't be back.~~#~0
I sometimes feel like 3 stars is a little deceiving. This place was good, I don't really have any complaints at all, but was it memorable, great, and would I really have an urge to go back, not necessarily. It was definitely more fancy than I was expecting given the other reviews. They try to make it have an upscale, date-night kind of feel, and that's cool, especially if you take advantage of the BYOBooze, w/out a fee. Something I was not aware of, but wish I was! The fresh guac that is offered is not complimentary, but it is good and well worth it. The menu is not chalk full of the usual enchiladas, chimi's, etc, but some fancier (maybe more traditional) Mexican entrees. I had a sirloin that was stuffed with three different cheeses, spinach, bacon, and covered in a tomato based sauce of some sort. I was a little disappointed in the lack of rich complex flavors given the players of ingredients, but again, it wasn't bad by any means. My gf had some vegetable type enchiladas that she said were very good, but we both had the same conclusion. It was good, nothing to complain about, but nothing great either.~~#~0
I like their teriyaki steak and rice plate.  It's decent for fast food.~~#~0
The atmosphere of the Scottsdale Sandbar is definitely a lot of fun. I'm not a huge fan of the food though...in a pinch it'll do. Guess if I'm eating I'd rather really enjoy the food.~~#~0
I took myself out to eat last Friday night and crashed in to La Piazza about 45mins before they closed. Did I get attitude from the staff? Nope! Good work guys!I ordered the linguine with spicy red clam sauce. Yum! I wish the sauce were thicker, but the taste was there!I also had a chocolate canolli. Also pretty good!The down side? It was a bit spendy for me. I had the salad ($3) which was a mountain of greens, two (2) grape tomatoes, and two (2) small cucumber slices. Seriously? Uncool.Ah well! It was for the most part good. Nothing to write Guy Fieri about though.~~#~0
Amy D told me to go here so I never even bothered to read her 3-star review.  Probably would have reconsidered if I had seen that.  I ordered the orange chicken and it was a bunch of small chicken balls covered in orange goo.  The fried rice was missing the other stuff that usually comes in fried rice.  It took them 15 minutes to make it which was fine since we called ahead and it takes about that long to get there.  I'll just say it - China Chili is better in ever way.  I might come back here but everything about China Chili is better.~~#~0
No idea this place existed even though I drive by this part of Scottsdale often, I had the Burmese gai, which was super spicy and super yummy. It would've been nice if it had more veggies in it, but good still. Boyfriends meal was ok, nothing to rave about.~~#~0
I havn't quite gotten into Thai food so that is why I am listing this as A Ok as the food was just ok in my opinion. For someone that loves Thai food though, this might be a terrific place. I had the yellow chicken curry with rice and my friend had the red chicken curry with rice. Both were ok but I liked the red better. They were served with some kind of soup which was not memorable for me. Probably a place worth giving a try if you like Thai. The atmosphere was a bit dark and old. I don't remember the pricing being bad either.~~#~0
New building is kind of obnoxious. Excellent food & drink; a great place to meet friends; not a great place to do any type of creative work, ironicaly.~~#~0
The cocktails, "shorty" versions of beer on tap, and great happy hour specials make this a great place to chill out mid-day and have a few drinks, especially if you are sitting outside. I've only had one appetizer there, the loaded chips, and they were great-tasting at first, but were a little ambitious with the ingredients--definitely overpowering. There were a few menu items I wanted to try, but on second glance, they also look a little too ambitious, so I have a feeling the taste is going to be too rich. (I cannot eat everything I like as I get older...major bummer!) The ambience is a happy medium between a place to chill with friends or have a dinner date. Everyone who's assisted me here has been superior--especially Rob the bartender. They should get 5-stars based on service!~~#~0
11/04/12HUGE Asian festival going on!Brought my aunt with me to check out the "Fire & Sand: Contemporary American Glass" exhibit today, but we were surprised to find an Asian festival going on.  (From what I gathered, these Asian showcases of jewelry and crafts are fairly common here.)  My aunt was very happy, as she loves to shop and haggle, and haggling is the norm in Manila (as it is in Asian cities), so she was in her element here!  I, on the other hand, was bored to tears.  Instead, I went off on a stroll while aunt shopped around; I eventually found some food trucks, and wouldn't you know that "Hey Joe" food truck was in the area.  We just ate a huge breakfast beforehand, so that was a bust.  I did find a Maui Shave Ice food truck, but that's another review for me to write...We eventually did check out the free glass exhibit, and it was very much worth the drive to Mesa from North Scottsdale!  I hope you enjoy the contraband photos I took and uploaded.  I hope to return soon and check out a few live shows.~~#~0
Go for the drinks, go for the food, go for the architecture but don't go for decent service; there is none to be found. Their cocktails are some of the best downtown and the building itself is amazing and conceptual. I've never had a bad plate of food there and they serve late but I've also never had decent service, always stuffy and standoffish. The last time I went in our server took the center piece off our table in the middle of our meal!  I always go in with the hopes that if I'm nice then the server will respond. Nope. Never. But I always go back.~~#~0
In a rush to get a quick lunch while in the area we opted to go here over the Paradise Bakery down the street.   While the food was ok and i'm all for supporting a small locally owned business we walked away a little disappointed. They focus on all types of breads including a variety of loaves, rolls, and some baked goods.  The also offer the usual lunch options of sandwiches, soups, and salads (premade).  Tried 1/2 chicken salad sandwich on some sort of raisin bread and a chicken noodle salad and 1 drink.  Both were not bad but also not memorable or unique in any way.  Service was  so-so as you got the impression that they were just focused on finishing up lunch service so they could close shop.  In their haste to get orders out they rang up ours wrong and forgot the roll and dressing. Overall seemed kinda pricey at $18 considering what we ordered and the competition. And unless the weather is nice enough to sit outside there is only seating for 8 or so. Nothing really unique about this place and can neither endorse nor oppose going to this place.  Give me a few days and i will probably forget about this place.~~#~0
Love the location and spot.  The patio area will be a huge draw now that the weather is finally good.  The food is meh.  The beer selection is great with a large chalkboard you can order from.  The main room is noisy (which a good ale house should be really) but I was really hoping the food would be tastier.  It's an eclectic menu, pizzas and spam sliders.  Things seemed to have been put on their randomly which is fine if puzzling.  The spam sliders are tasty and worth the fat and sodium bomb that they are.  The pizzas are a bit lacking but the salads are well done.  All in all, great place to see friends, just don't come super hungry :)~~#~0
OK - slight update - didn't review my second visit, will review 3rd and won't elaborate on why I continue to go to restaurant that I'm not in love with.Furnishing is really nice, tasteful. Lunch menu just doesn't work for me. But clay pot dish of chicken/egg plant was really tasty and I am more positive about the place.~~#~0
The food was good the service was friendly. This place is very hard to find... poor visibility.~~#~0
Good quick lunch downtown.  I recently (July 08) served on a jury, and ate here everyday (4x).  I'm a sucker for rice bowl Japanese, what can I say?  Better then the typical Kyoto Bowl or Tokyo Express (the usual Phoenix rice bowl chains)  Interesting menu choices, mostly clean, and quick service.  I enjoyed the spicy teriyaki and the edamame.  Don't expect any ambiance, and I think it's only open for lunch, anyway.~~#~0
Pure Sushi was OK...but there are better places to get fish...~~#~0
I love the bench style seating/common eating area. Had the cheese enchalada and chile relleno. No distinct flavors but enjoyable nonetheless. Thursdays you get a free medium drink with order of any combo.~~#~0
Meh, I was pretty unimpressed with the Phoenix Zoo.. Dont get me wrong, any zoo is cool as shit in my book, I just wasn't wowed at all by anything going on here.There is an alright mix of animals, coolest ones included the giraffes, my favorite of course, the jungle cats and the stingrays we had to pay $3 each to hang out with and pet. Then on top of that you pay another $5 for a cup of shrimp and anchovies to feed to them.. $16 collectively for two people for one exhibit alone and you've just bought another adult admission. Steep, but I will say the rays were pretty rad even though all ll I could think about was Steve Erwin and dying a miserable electrical death, so my inhibitions were high, but once I realized 37 5 year olds were braver than I was, I sucked it up and stuck my hands in the pool. In case you didn't know, they are wicked slimy.Another thing that I wish I could have done was ride one of the camels, but my dumb ass wore a dress, so this wasn't about to happen. The biggest let down of the day was the fact that one of the exhibits was under some psycho construction, so there were baco's and dump trucks and other various tractors making copious amounts of obnoxious noise. Needless to say the safari trail was anything but tranquil.. I felt really bad for the chimps that had to sit next to that shit all day too. Not cool.. wait till you close and move those babies.I dunno, maybe its just the concept of tropical animals residing in the desert that is strange to me, but its just not that awesome here. I felt bad for them, and I don't think its just because I am a hippie. Also, I'm not sure if its always as crowded as it was or if every pre-school in Arizona was taking a field trip here that day but it was so loud, there were strollers everywhere, I almost fell on about 12 kids, got tripped by about 54 of them, but nonetheless, it was funny and seeing how excited they got at the sight of the animals made it a little bit more magical, even though this zoo kinda blows.~~#~0
nirvana for quirky diets. homemade tsoynami dessert, buffalo chicken wings. put on your flower shirt and that dreads wig your brother brought you from bahamas and just go.--staff knows every ingredient of every dish. haven for allergy prone or those just making quirky choices (sorry, vee-jees. i just don't get it)--get one of those cookies under glass at the counter. thank me later.--order the tsunami dessert special. i could almost hear my mom's ice cream maker grinding in the background.--what every indie coffee bar SHOULD be: serving healthy food made from freshly prepared ingredients.--keeps your palate on its toes at all the flavor substitutions. bloody brilliant!eating these buffalo "chicken" pieces reminds me of the absolute CRAP that other places are calling meat right now, and I realize i'm WAY safer right now.thanks for the compliment on my "chops". anywhere else i would have just got a frown a squint, and an unspoken "geez. get a haircut, you slob!" don't worry, I went immediately to the salon and they're back where they should be.[prejudiced, judgmental observation and affirmation]to whit: i do respect your-all's choice to not eat meat. I really do! i also respect you for being just damn GENIUS intelligent. but you don't have to make this choice to earn my respect. proof in the recent majority of "FATTY, "ANTIBIOTIC-PUMPED-TO-KEEP-ME-ALIVE, STOOD-IN-MY-OWN-POOP-'TILL-THEY-SLAUGHTERED-ME" _FEED LOT_ "MEAT". WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THIS COUNTRY'S MEAT???!!!" i will still love ya just the same if you will join me at Morton's.[/prejudiced, judgmental observation and affirmation]~~#~0
A relaxing stay in the dessert. The rooms are spacious and the price is fair.~~#~0
I have eaten at Postino between five and ten times, honestly I don't really remember (that's not a good thing), because I had a client for a while that loved the place.  This is not a review based on one visit.Postino is a very "trendy" Arcadia hangout.  All the cool kids go there and love to be seen sitting in such a chic environment.  Postino and it's counterpart La Grande Orange are both modeled after a European experience.  The atmosphere is fun and it does make you feel just a little more important than you did before entering their door.The food on the other hand is uninspired and nothing exceptional.  Yes it is good, yes it is somewhat unique, no it does not deserve the amazing amounts of praise that it enjoys.  The wine selection however  is good, there should be no problem finding something you likeTo boil it down, we have a decent meal with a good wine selection, in a super trendy place to eat... Perfect for people who care more about appearances than food.  That being said you should try Postino out, it is fun and maybe you will think the food more inspired than I did.~~#~0
It's not the worst place, it's not the best.  The meats are good.  The bread is often a little soggy from too much butter.  The sides are all sub-par.I'd probably get the meat to-go and make the rest of the meal myself with sides I picked up at the grocery store.~~#~0
I love John Hughes movies, but this Breakfast Club did not live up to its namesake. The eggs were serviceable, but the potatoes O'Brian (I learned a new thing here!) were nothing special--kind of soft and oily, with large chunks of pepper. The jalepeno biscuits, which sounded conceptually grand, were not quite what I'd call a biscuit. They were tough, unflavorful little disks with jalepenos baked in. The heuvos rancheros looked like something my cat barfed up, however, they tasted fine, according to my breakfastmate. Overall, I think this was a shade greasier than we were expecting. And outdoor seating is nice, but a mixed bag when abutting a busy road. The service was good, but something about the waitresses reminded me of the Stepford Wives.~~#~0
After reading a few reviews from other yelp members I have to agree with them. I'm not going to go into detail, I'm just going to give a quick summary. We were at the place at 7pm on a Friday. If you want  table, they will be hard to find.1) Wine - I had a Cabernet - It was good but not spectacular. I'm sure that it was an honest pour, but for some reason, it seemed less that other places. 2) Bruschetta - Fair. Outside was nice and crunchy while the center was soggy. (Other reviews had similar comments.)3) Service - Was not spectacular. The waitresses seemed pre-occupied with other things. It seems that we were not the priority of her evening.4) Music - Way too loud. We were not able to talk without yelling across the tables. Very annoying. Although the DJ was pretty good with a great selection of music.I was really hoping to give this place better reviews. If you like this place, you will love Postino's.~~#~0
Beware: VERY strong scents! They were good for me, but I was overloaded by the time I left.The thing that sold me on this place was the AMAZING young woman that helped myself, my friend, and my friend's mother. She answered every single question we threw at her, she let us try everything we wanted, play with stuff, smell it all, taste it (if we could), and was spot on in finding scents that we would enjoy. If I could remember her name I would mention her here, but wow, she was awesome.Of course, being in Fashion Square Mall this place is expensive. I purchased a few wrapped gift boxes for Christmas because they looked awesome and had a good selection of products inside.Why three stars? I'm kind of "eh, whatever" about the stuff I have personally purchased and used. The bath bombs smell great but their scent exists pretty much only when they are solid, and I have found the same skin moisturizing effect from dollar store bombs.In addition, quite a few of their soaps use SLS (my sensitive skin is easily wrecked by this & other chemicals) and the bars don't later well, which I found odd considering SLS usually provides a foamy rich bubbly lather.If anything this place smells amazing and has a ton of cute things to gift to people. I won't be buying their products for personal use, but I would probably buy some soaps just for "display" purposes.~~#~0
North is located in the upscale Kierland Mall. It is not very big and on the  Monday night we were there it was full both inside and outside. It was also very noisy.The food is labeled "Italian" and is a variation on that genre. My antipasti plate had too many ingredients on it, none very distinguished. My fish was fine and the dessert good.Service was very good when the waitperson came over but we had to ask for water twice.Overall it's not bad but if you walk east another block you'll come to the better Zinc Bistro.~~#~0
This is a college bar. With that being said, booze are cheap, place is broken down like a older Van Buren street walker but well, the booze are cheap. Went in during one of their better drinking days with some buddies because of the $1 you-call-its...$5 dollar admission for guys...sucks but if you drink enough then the cover charge pays for it self. Has a patio for smoking, parking is pretty plentiful since everyone walks there since they're gonna be crawling out due to cheap booze. Haven't tried the food since I was on a alcohol diet so I can't comment on it. Is this place kid friendly? No. Is this a place to get messed up on the cheap? Yes. Bring your friends so they can help carry you out if you go on the days of the $1 you-call-its.~~#~0
I had the Taco Salad for lunch.  It was spicy which made up for any shortcuts from a short order kitchen.  Very friendly folks.  I bet they are a perfect place for breakfast a simple country breakfast.  Prices are really cheap!  Cheaper than fast food!~~#~0
Another tough one that will require revisiting and re-scoring in a few to several months, if things change. Had a few visits so far, with generally good but mixed results.THE CONCEPT - 4 StarsI'm no Weil disciple who drops to their knees and goes all agape for his every utterance. But I think he is the perfect partner for a Fox concept, as long as the fresh, fresh, fresh motto is adhered to over the long term. I like some of the Fox places (okay one, Greene House) and it's the same chef that opened True Food.My Dad was recently diagnosed with Seliac Disease and seeing more and more restaurants acknowledge that dietary restriction on gluten is important to a growing segment of people is refreshing. The menu makes it easy to distinguish between various dietary regimens and other considerations, in both food and drink. I eat anything, but it sure makes it easier to eat with those who are justifiably (and sometimes unjustifiably) conscious of what they put in their bodies.Everything from the mixed drinks to the food items seems to be VERY fresh, or at least sourced very well.THE SPACE - 4 StarsSimple, modern, open California kitchen appeal. I like how they raised the ceiling of the old Coffee Plantation shithole. The mural wall and the over-sized lamps are fun. Open kitchens are always a little more fun and give you something to talk about if your date is lacking in conversational acumen.THE EXECUTION (for now) - 3 StarsServiceThey're trying. Things still seem jittery with some of the servers. Have seen a lot of food go to the wrong tables and places. I'm sure they'll work through that. Everyone is friendly, but not necessarily knowledgable about the food. Sure they've memorized the spiel, but these aren't foodie servers. They're young, friendly folks working at a hip spot.FoodHave tried several things that were tasty and fresh, if not particularly interesting. They just kind of show you that you can eat stuff that is relatively healthy and not have it taste like nothing. A few things so far have shined: the spelt pizzas have a unique, chewy crust and nice toppings. The Kale Salad is unique and delicious. Nice textures. The Shrimp Dumplings are nice, but make you yearn to eat real chinese, or make your own like you like 'em. Steak Tacos are of the Fresh Mex variety but have a great char.On the downside...I had the Turkey Bolognese Penne. To me, there is never an excuse for overcooked pasta. If you cook it, and it's overdone, throw it away and cook it again. Check your pasta, it's the heart of the dish. I neglected to order "al dente" because so many places give you that look like "But of course, signore!" And you shouldn't have to ask for pasta to be done that way. That's the only way it should be done, unless you're eating Spaghettios. As for the sauce, it tasted like diced San Marzano's which is great! But if you use the canned San Marzano's omit the little pieces with the unchewable stem base. Cut that part out or pitch the piece. I added shrimp to the dish at the server's suggestions, despite my past history of NOT combining shrimp and turkey. Call me crazy, but that's just not a combo I yearn for. Would have been fine though, except that the shrimp were completely undercooked. I eat shrimp raw, when I intend to, but that clear uncooked shrimp is not the texture you want in a cooked dish. At sashimi/sushi, yes. Pasta, no. Seems to happen a lot though. And no discernible seasoning or flavor to them either.My wife's salmon was largely flavorless, and very rare. Fine for us as we love raw salmon. But at a certain point, she just would have preferred sashimi and the accompanying soy sauce. I'm sure the amount or rareness would have been a problem for many diners. Especially when combined with almost no salt. On that note, the fresh fish crudo of the day was a nice hamachi with an excellent yuzu/miso (? - that's what it tasted like) sauce. BOTTOM LINE - 3 Stars for nowI could see this going either way in the future, but if they stay fresh and improve on the execution, it's a no-brainer that they will end up a 4 star. I don't think they'll ever hit 5 stars, just because their commitment to the healthy stuff and a very broad appeal will keep them from really being able to push it from a culinary standpoint.~~#~0
I went to Ticoz Friday night for a birthday dinner. I'd been before and remembered not being too impressed. I read a few reviews on here and prepared myself for having to Valet. I thought the atmosphere was nice. We were in a separate room because we were a large party. And no valet in sight - yay! I thought the server was great - really friendly and prompt. He offered to do separate checks - so nice.  I ordered the BBQ burger. It was huge and came with waffle fries. It was really good and a large enough portion to take half home. The price was reasonable - under $15 with a soda. Overall I was happy with my experience. This restaurant is really close to my house and the food was good. Unfortunately there are so many restaurants in the area that it's hard to say when I'd be back but I would definitely recommend it.~~#~0
I've eaten here a few times now, and it's a okay. It's a fast casual diner that serves Greek style food.  You order and pay at the counter, they give you a number for your table, and when the food is ready, they walk it out to you.The first time I ate here, I carried out a Gyro, and it was awesome.  Tasty, hot, and really hit the spot. The second time I ate here, I got the brusetta.  I didn't like it all that much, and don't know that I would order it again.the reason I didn't like it was because of the following.  A) to many tomato's on the brucetta, and they were cold! B) Bread was warm, and to soft.  C) not my style of brusetta.  I like brusetta to be on toasted french bread, and have it be warm all around.  This wasn't.Next time I eat here I think I'm going to stick with the Gyro since it was so tasty.~~#~0
I have eaten at many cheesecake factories, from Biltmore/Phoenix to Kierland to Irving, CA to San Diego and beyond, and. I can honestly say that my experience this last Saturday has completely soured the experience. I know that one lousy waitress shouldn't ruin my entire opinion of a franchise, but "Tiana" our waitress as pretty much guaranteed that it will be a LONG time before I return. It took forever to get anything we ordered. After saying we were not interested in dessert, she proceeded to spend 15 minutes telling us about the new items on the menu. She brought out our check without asking if we would like to split the check. We gave her 2 cards told her to put $X on one card and the balance on the other. When she brought it back, she had done the opposite. A few days later when we looked online at our bank accounts, she did not charge me at all and charged my friends card twice.It was just a miserable experience and I hope it doesn't speak for the chain as a whole and the types of people they are choosing to hire to represent their brand.~~#~0
I've eaten here many times.  However, I haven't been here for a while.  The food has always been good.  So has the service.  I just knocked off a star because it's been a while since I've been there -- too many restaurants; not enough money!I gotta go back.~~#~0
EH is what I think about when I remember my visit to Centurion.I had a groupon to use so with my Mom in town I figured it was a great time to go and check this place out.  Well we went for lunch and as we were seated in a completely empty place we were asked if we made a reservation for lunch.  I was caught off guard and said no did I need to and she said yes according to the groupon.  Well it expired that day so she let it slide (thanks).On to the food my mom got a pasta and salad and I ordered the pulled duck pizza.  I was really excited to try the pizza as I am a big pizza fan and this place uses wood fire and a brick oven to cook them so YAY I was excited.  Well all came crashing down when I got the pizza.  The outer crust was charred black and inedible and the center was not crispy.  The duck was just a few pieces maybe on small one per slice so overall just not a great experience.  Luckily my Mom enjoyed her salad and pasta so not all was a failure.  I see lots of good reviews so I won't say steer clear but I know I probably won't be back.~~#~0
I've been to Armitage a couple of times.  The food is pretty good, they have a great selection of stuff to pick on - olives, chips and dip, cheese plate, and a delicious grilled artichoke. Pretty good wine list and they have a nice selection of flights.  The happy hour prices and daily specials are tough to beat.  Big patio seating area. These are the positive aspects of the place.Now for the negative aspects...I wish they had a better selection of high end cheeses, I'm sure I'm not the only person that walks in there hoping to do better than find Boursin as an offering but I guess they know their clientele.  Inside is loud and looks more like a sports bar than a wine lounge.  Service is terrible - terrible, terrible, terrible.  They also seem to lack creativity and finesse in their dishes but I guess that's how they keep the prices low.This is another circumstance where I would give a 2.5 if I could.~~#~0
I was not greeted or assisted. And this was my first visit so that's a big negative for me. But the place was very clean. All the toppings were organized and easy to figure out and reach. They were all labeled too. The yogurt had digital labeling! Little mini tv screens with the yogurts calorie count! And ingredients. I chose cake batter. Cheesecake and twos bar. With fresh strawberries and fresh kiwi and coconut and Heath bar. The go by weight so my portion cost me under 3$ 5 star for cleanliness.5 star for stocked items and price3 for customer service~~#~0
Where the heck are the blue shopping baskets?!Out of the dozens of times we have come to this location, I think we have seen the blue shopping baskets maybe twice; I don't want to use a shopping cart for 3 items, and I don't want to awkwardly carry stuff while I look around at other products in the store.Anyway, Wal-Mart has low prices for sure. We don't usually get produce or meat from here, but packaged food prices are usually the same or lower than some grocery stores. Home goods and health and beauty items are priced well and typically beat other department stores.I rarely am able to find someone to help look for something, and if I do, they don't have much pep in their step or enthusiasm. Seldom do employees go above and beyond to help customers.Customer service line is always slow, but we don't very often have a problem with returns, no-receipt returns, or exchanges; they are usually accommodating. This location is fairly clean, has a large parking lot with wide lanes, and has a fairly good selection of food and home goods.~~#~0
Most of the food is good, sometimes the fish portion sizes vary, once my husband ordered it and it was huge the next time is was like 3 times smaller. Service varies it just depends on who you get. Also the assistant night manager is rude. We took our 4 kids out to dinner since it was my daughters 10th birthday and was refused service since it was close to closing time. It was 7:56 pm and the sign on the window said they closed @9. Was told they channged the hours to close at 8 so we could not be served even though we were already in the restaurant ready to be seated.~~#~0
It seems as if my experience was not the norm. It was pretty busy while I was there, and I managed to get through security in just a few minutes. That alone substantiates my 3 star review. I wish I didn't pay for a wifi account, bc it was free here. Aside from wifi and my personal experience with security, it's not actually that great of an airport. I don't think it's very well laid out, the dining options suck, there isn't enough seating at many of the gates, my flight (along with several others) had to be moved to another gate.~~#~0
With a disappointed sigh, one of the few after hours options limps off into the sunset.  Sadly, Dolce is no longer open all night - even on the weekends.  Also - of the 5 times I wanted a croissant, they only had it twice.  Still recommended... but please!  Someone open something that's all-night and non-diner-y!ORIGINAL REVIEW: The urban nightcrawler in me danced the dance of joy when I heard there was a 24-hour indie coffeehouse in my neighborhood (at least on the weekends)!The various bakery options are oversized and decadently sweet - pretty tasty.  The real stars are the coffee and the breakfast items.  Like a couple of others below, I'm a fan of the caramel bianco, which has a richer, deeper, more complex espresso flavor than the big chains.  When you get a ham, egg, and cheese croissant, you're getting a huge, fluffy, buttery croissant with a nice portion of tangy ham, and eggs that are actually fluffy (not flattened into one solid brick of egg).  Perhaps a tad messy if you're eating in the car, but if you're going to hang out here (which you should), it's well worth it.The service isn't as crazy fast as a Starbucks, but it's well worth the quality and personal attention.  If you're not in a hurry, consider it an opportunity to get to know Leo, who owns and operates the place and is always a good conversationalist.  I'd prefer to chat or read than watch inane pop videos, which kinda get in the way of the whole coffeehouse experience for me. I've been looking for something to replace Counter Culture ever since it left the McDowell location, and while Dolce is only 24 hours on the weekends, it's definitely got potential.  I look forward to becoming a 3am regular.~~#~0
I really wanted to like this place and I think if I had ordered anything else off of their menu I would have.  Unfortunately I ordered their veggie and it just didn't really work out.  The bread was great and all their veggies were nice and fresh, but the sandwich just needed a little something extra (a second cheese, some seasoning, SOMETHING) just to give it some flavor.  I tried adding salt and pepper but it just wasn't enough.I'm giving them three stars since the guys working there were really friendly and the bread was good.  If I ever get a chance to come back to Phoenix I'll give one of their meat sandwiches a try.~~#~0
Very good pizza, salads and drinks.  Great neighborhood place. Atmosphere is first rate and sitting on the terrace with torches is awesome.  On music nights you will find the music unexpectedly good. My only negative is that service is lack luster at best.~~#~0
This place is ok....average...nothing you haven't seen before.  It's your typical sports bar restaurant.  They have a lot of TVs which makes sports watching great.  It's extremely LOUD.  The prices for food are typical for this type of establishment.  Service has always been good here.  I wish they had something unique about the place.....like a menu item, a drink, or even a happy hour special.  Unfortunately, they don't....it's your typical sports bar restaurant....   Which is too bad because the location is great.~~#~0
I've eaten here numerous times for lunch.  The staff is very friendly and the place is clean.   What keeps me coming back?  The Chicago club and the Broccoli cheese soup.  This is some of the best broccoli cheese soup I've ever had.  I'll be keeping this place on my lunch destinations~~#~0
A small, tidy stadium for the A's.  Parking lot available (most recently for the 2012 season $5) across the street from the stadium with a walkway overpass to get people to and from the p-lot/stadium (handicap accessible).  There's some shady seats available and plenty in the sun.  Bring a jacket if you sit in the shade, can even get a bit chilly!  As for the food, the most important part of baseball, there didn't seem to be  huge selection here.  I think on one end there were some sort of chow mein available (weird) and then the main specialty seemed like the bratwursts and the hotdogs fresh off the bbq.  Get the footlong dog!  So delicious and probably the most worth it.  I didn't try it but they also have fresh brewed ice cream!  Anyway, get the dog!~~#~0
Ekkk not impressed!!! Very small and far! It was clear and educational though I would go here for a field trip! I went for free for this free arts of Arizona event and there was a Native American festival going on so there may have been more excitement than usual. It was just a little too small for me to be called a museum. Bathrooms were outside. Lots of parking and its free and for you avid museum goers they have these free passports you can get stamped and embossed from all the museums fun!~~#~0
I feel this is still a 2.5/3 star place and it really based on their food.  The food is good most of the time but the service, the service is really bad each and every time I go there!~~#~0
This restaurant came highly recommended as an adventurous experience. But in the end, I just felt like Posh was trying very hard to be clever without being innovative. First off, let me just say that the service was excellent and spot on. Our waitress knew just the right time to stop by our table and we felt very well taken care of.The restaurant has a certain rotating menu already set and then tries to make it seem like it's made especially for you. They do try somewhat to fit into your likes/dislikes and dietary restrictions. They used a number of unusual game -- wild boar bacon, sweetbread, quail, frog legs -- but it seemed they used the novelty of the food rather than focusing on the prep of it. I mean, I've had all of those items (except the wild boar bacon). Give me something special. Well, they just didn't deliver. Don't get me wrong. The food was very good but it didn't blow me away in any respect.~~#~0
Nothing fancy here - just a good gym with everything you need at a decent price, right in the pocket between Paradise Valley & Scottsdale.~~#~0
Nice selection on tap and nice atmosphere.  Unfortunately the food doesn't quite get to the 4 or 5 star mark.I was excited to see the traditional Haddock used for fish and chips, especially when I ordered the large portion to share with my wife.  When the plate arrived with a pound of Haddock in two long slabs hanging over the plate (That's what I'm talkin' about!) I was thrilled.  Then a mild case of disappointment set in:  the fish was slightly overdone and tasted a little fishy.  I also did not like that the chips had a coating.  Oh well.  We are a long way from the Atlantic aren't we.~~#~0
To me this place is 3.5 stars. I'm not dying to go back, so I rounded down to a 3. The burger was tasty for a fast food joint and reasonably priced. A big plus is choosing what you want on it. It was a little greasy, but everything seemed fresh. A step above Johnny rockets type place, but I have in n out a step above five guys. Nothing really stood out. The cajon fries were saturated in oil and were just not good at all. I really wanted to love it, but I just "liked" it.~~#~0
I ended up going to this restaurant after finding that Timo's was closed.  The food is great for what it is.  It is set up like a cross between a cafeteria and a diner.....not my usual choice for eating.  When you walk in your hearded down a narrow walk where you are lead to a register.  You order your food and get your utensils, drinks, condements, napkins,....pretty much everything yourself.  I"m a restaurant snob so they lost points for that but it may not be a concern for you.  The food was good, nothing to write home about.  Service was friendly and polite.  If you are going to be meeting people, don't pick this restaurant.  There is NO WHERE TO WAIT for people, not even a bench out side and you can't sit until you order.~~#~0
I give it 3 stars because has an appealing environment, good food & service.I'm not a fan of high priced burgers with limited options, unless you go for a basic $9 burger with nothing on it, then get charged $1.25 for every topping added after that. If I'm in the mood for a burger and a beer, I'll stick to Smash Burger!~~#~0
I ate here for the second time in the past year. I had fried tofu and asparagus rolls the first time. It was fine, the tofu was battered then fired. I preferred it without the batter. Second visit I had a salmon skin roll, OMG so yummy. I also had mozzarella and jalapeno wrapped in seaweed and deep fried in tempura... I wasn't sure of the seaweed and cheese combo. It was very tasty.. I've already decide on my next meal there, I'm having the salmon skin roll with miso soup and salad! My niece had a combo plate, she was happy with her meal as well! It was a lot of food. Another GREAT thing about this eatery they don't use styrofoam takeout containers.~~#~0
Dave was craving a cheeseburger sub, which I thought were nonexistent out here; however, after a quick search on yelp we found this place and it wasn't too far, only about 10 miles. I was hoping to find that little gem, but unfortunately I didn't. I had a single cheeseburger, I liked everything except the rocket sauce...no matter what you call it, it's 1000 island on all these burgers (In/Out, McD's and every other burger place with special sauce is either straight up 1000 island or some variant of it), and normally I like it; however, I did not care for this particular version. It was watery.  I did like the actual burger.Again, I'm a lover of onion rings and I was super excited to see all the great reviews, until I actually tried them. I didn't care for them at all. The breading was horrible, I ate them because I was hungry...the breading did not grow on me! The selection of sodas was amazing, they have an extensive menu, the prices are extremely reasonable, the service friendly, the customers eclectic, but the overall quality of the meal was just 3 stars for me.~~#~0
Ahh the valley metro, so far so good, and ridership seems unusually high....maybe a little too high? Due to hardly anyone checking to see if you bought the right ticket, much less have one at all, everyone from the homeless man that decides he needs to move back to downtown to teenagers out for a jig are on this thing. I have taken this thing from the start on 19th and Glendale, to the end in Mesa, I've taken it from work to the airport and back, and out partying. So I know what I am talking about here that more ticketeers need to check people! Well I once got checked but that was about 11:30PM at the Roosevelt station from what appeared to be the Senior Citizen Police Brigade, seriously about 5 of them, checking all tickets of those who were on platform or who got on and off, it was rather hillarious...Oh light rail, symbol of a sprawling metropolitan area out of control, new, but still insufficient to get people where they need to go.~~#~0
The lounge atmosphere is great.  The service is horrible.  The bartenders just walk right by you.  Even if you put your empty glass at the end of the bar they still do not acknowledge that you need a drink... really??  You need to wave your hand in air and almost yell across the place to get any service.  The DJ needs to be updated with the latest music.  It could be a great place if ran better.  Scottsdale Quarter needs something with some dancing and excitement!   If they were smart they would make some changes.. this could be "the spot"~~#~0
Disappointed:( Could of been better, because when food was brought out, the presentation was very nice..... The nachos seriously needed to be season and the same for the calamari!! The calamari was very meaty and they serve you a lot, but no seasoning, not even a dab of salt!! The beer according to my mom was *fabulous* Too bad, because the price is reasonable~~#~0
Nightlife/beverage only review:Primebar sports the same crowd that rocks out at Sapporo and other "Cougar Dens".  The crowd is made up of older patrons that enjoy dressing like their teenage children.  My friend and I enjoyed people watching and trying to figure out what drugs the lead singer of the cover band was on.  Several beers are on tap and fairly priced.  Not much is open in the Scottsdale Quarter after 10 pm, so this place allows folks in the area to party until bar time.~~#~0
We've been going to the place since it first opened. I mean this literally, we waited when we saw the sign for it to open, before the place ever opened. The food is the best you're going to find in all of Queen Creek or San Tan Valley. The sandwichs are incredible. Their specials are always delicious though a bit overpriced. This is a family owned and operated place who take pride in developing the flavors as you will taste with their food. So WHY the 3 stars instead of 5? Simply, the servers. Other then one male server who goes out of his way to please you, the rest are bringing this place down. I use to go once a week, then down to once a month, but after my last experience with the same waitress who has her mind on finishing school rather then serving the customers, I stopped going all together. I have complained about this waitress the last 3 times I got stuck with her as the waitress. The last time, all the owner did was comp the meal instead of dealing with the problem. I know alot of people in town who feel the same about this waitress. The owner even told me all the servers split their tips, so even if you don't tip her, she makes money off of the other servers tips. RIDICULOUS!!!If the owners are not going to take pride in their service as they do their food, they won't see me or my family back again. Sorry guys!~~#~0
We love Sushi, so we frequent various local RA and Stingray establishments, regularly.  The RA Ahwatukee location is convenient to us and good for Happy Hour cocktails and food specials.  I find that while the bar staff seems cordial enough, they are not the most outgoing or friendliest we've experienced in other comparable spots.  However, the food here is the absolute standard of what a traditional RA establishment provides - Good.  Our favorite thing to order is the 'Tunacado'...This dish features perfectly seared Ahi Tuna surrounded by delicious slices of avocado & a side of the most amazing creamy Ponzu sauce under the sun!   Enjoy!~~#~0
I would be a fan, if I could have a FREE membership! hahaha. Yes, as any other, this works better for large families, so I was happy to walk around with my friend and her membership card. Some things are worth, but some you can get better deals in the stores you all know. Clean alleys, a cheap berry smoothie (and not tooo sweet!). My temptation? Brookside pomegranate dark chocolate!! You have to try it! only sold in Costco!!~~#~0
I would give this 3.5 stars.  good value, nice service, nice indoor/outdoor space.  Food is not as sophisticated as the menu might suggest.  Wines are good, not amazing.  My husband & i were in phoenix from DC & came here based on strong yelper recommendations.  We had a good time, but we've been to yummier wine bars.~~#~0
I like these burgers.  It does cost more than In & Out, but you don't have to deal with the mob there.  Don't ever buy the milk shake without the combo.  I decided I wanted a milk shake to take home,,,,,,$4.16 for a one size of small.  It is hand made, but still,,,,,,~~#~0
Came here after a day of wild flower hunting in the Superstitions- it was a Wed. so all of us ordered the baby back bbq rib special.  Not especially memorable.  What I did like was the cole slaw made from purple cabbage and vinegar with some black pepper.  No mayo, extremely light, healthy and delicious.  The cole slaw was the saving grace.  This place was so unmemorable to me that I forgot the name of the restaurant and had to do a search for bbq in Chandler.  When I can't remember the name of a restaurant, that tells it all~~#~0
cute little space uptown.  the flavors are very creamy...sometimes so creamy they mask some of the flavor.  baked good are tasty but not out of the ordinary.  it's a cute spot to grab a snack or dessert after eating at windsor (see other review...not sure that will ever become a destination restaurant) or postino, but wouldn't drive out of your way if you're anywhere near some of the other excellent ice cream/gelato shops around the valley.~~#~0
Just got back from a 3 day stay at the resort. Our room was nice and clean... bed more comfortable than mine at home... tv was old school...but when do really watch tv on vacation. We went to the water park... which was a lot of fun for my 16year old neice and my two boys. Ate at the Lobby Grill and the food is over priced and not that tasty. Thank God they are near the Arizona Mills and other restrurants. I will say this... we were the only "minority" there. Their demographic is mainly Caucasians and some their guest were looking at us like we were out of place or lost. I don't think I would return for another stay... maybe if they diversify their demographic target.~~#~0
Have only eaten here twice, was quite happy with the food quality and the service was top notch. A little pricey, but worth the occasional visit.~~#~0
I've lived in the Valley for about 5 years now, and when this location opened, I was quite excited since it's closer to my home. The service is pretty good, and the sushi isn't bad, but I personally prefer the Ra on Mill Ave. Definitely come in for reverse happy hour - you can get a lot at really good prices.And as others have stated... it's Arizona, you're not going to find sushi as great as other places. But for what it's worth, especially here in AZ, it's really not that bad,~~#~0
Honest to goodness the best chinese food I've ever had was at a tiny family owned restaurant on the island of Santorini in Greece, maybe it had something to do with being so over Greek food by the second week of my trip but ever since then I've been on a seach for a non-chain restaurant in the states that compares.  My husband and I just moved to Chandler a couple of months ago and found Hong Kong Bistro as we were driving to the supermarket one day. We decided to check it out. The small restaurant was cute, the staff was very helpful and polite, our waitress asked if it was our first time, made suggestions and asked for our names to remember for the next time.  I ordered the Garlic Chicken, just as good as any I've had at any other chinese restaurant, the egg drop soup was also good, it had corn it which was a little weird but still good. My husband ordered the Gang Pang chicken which was spicy and very good.  They have a combo special where you add $1 to your meal and get a crab puff, egg roll, soup and fried rice added to your already very well priced main dish. They also have a small bar which looked fully loaded to me.  All in all it was as good as any other chinese restaurant I've been to, not the best, but for the price and location I was pleased and would definitely go back.~~#~0
Somewhere between A-OK and "Meh, I've experience better" lies Eastwind.  It's average fast-ish Japanese food that is ordered at the cash register and brought to your table.  The atmosphere is alright; more like a regular sit-down place than fast food (a plus).  The menu is pretty varied, with plenty of vegetarian options.  I ordered the Teriyaki Lite lunch combo, which consisted of a bowl of white meat teriyaki chicken over rice, an 8-piece California roll, and a side salad.  They let me have a seaweed salad with it instead of iceberg lettuce, which was nice.  Only $7.20 for all that food.  My co-workers' pad thai looked and smelled pretty good and they seemed to like it.I suppose Eastwind is a decent spot for an inexpensive lunch with co-workers.~~#~0
Keep in mind it is the first day open....1.  Lots of employees standing around chatting, "when do we take our breaks?"2.  It took me 32 minutes to get through the line and there were only two people in front of me.  I would have thought they would have done more training, or brought in some cashiers from other stores to help them through the first day.  The cashier was very friendly, but just didn't know how to do things...like ring up veggies or deal with a credit card whose magnetic stripe wasn't working.3.  The store was well organized, well laid out, clean, etc.4.  I'm curious about customers though....what possesses people to take everyone in thier family and spread across the aisle so no one else can get by.  Literally, 14 times in 40 minutes in the store I had to ask people to let me through because they were oblivious that there were other people that might have some place to move on to.....~~#~0
My kids and I love the food.  We are always looking for a good breakfast and we got it here.  My only complaint is that they should have better coffee.  It is an average cup and for me excellent coffee is a must to keep me coming back consistently.~~#~0
My wife and I have gone to this place twice. The first time the service was mediocre, but the food was excellent. Today, we went back because we wanted to try their sushi. Overall it was a good visit, the service was OK, the sushi was good, but they didn't do a very good wrapping for the sashimi. I don't think we'll go back I'm just not sure it was worth the bucks.~~#~0
First time i am giving a Fox Restaurant such a low rating.Really was not at all impressed by the dishes. My food was in the luke warm family when i got it. I really don't mind luke warm food. It's nice cause i can just start eating with out worrying about scalding my face. (wish it was a little bit warmer though). I got the veal raviolis and shrimp ontop (as recommend by the server).Shrimp was overcooked... :\, ravioli was just okay... I wasn't really blown away by it. Veal tasted dry inside...is that possible with ravioli? I tried the rest of my parties dishes and i wasn't blown away. Maybe my expectations have become too high of the fox restaurants.I will chalk it up to a bad night at the restaurant. I'd give them a second try because all the other fox restaurants i have been to, i've enjoyed. But out of this experience it was a 3.  :\~~#~0
Nice people, fair prices. They lost a star since a 1.25 hour job turned into a 2.5 hr job. I arrived at the time they told me it would be done but when I got there they had not started the work. I had to wait 1 hr 15 min which was not only a waste of time, but it made me miss running two errands I wanted to get done, and my gym time for the day.~~#~0
I wouldn't typically to go that kind of restaurant for a mexican food ( I look for hole-in-the-wall type of mexican restaurants), but because I was with a big family who was craving for a mexican dish, I found this place in my area (Southeast Valley). My grannies were thrilled to see the 2 for 1 deal for senior citizens-the place was flooded with happy 'n' stomach-crammed senior citizens-we were waiting for them to leave and tables to clear up. I can understand some of the bad reviews, but the restaurant has been there forever, since I was born, and it's good enough for a big group who aren't very picky about Mexican food. A neutral place in hope to satisfy everyone in the group as there are alot of selections on the menu. I was lucky to have had an amazing vegetarian tamale called "Tamale Dinner" (with green chili corns), and apparently, it's one of their specials. I finished the whole plate-the rice and beans were delicious, and I was surprised to leave without an upset stomach (mexican food=be ready for a screwed up digestion function). I wish we sat outside as there is a nice terrace with a man-made lake view.~~#~0
Daily dose is pretty darn good. Service is fine and happy hour prices are great. Terrific Bloody Mary.~~#~0
I love the atmosphere of this restaurant. I have been coming here for years and sitting outside by the pond always makes me feel like I'm on a mini break from AZ but over the course of the last year or so I feel the quality of the food has severly declined. I don't know what happened but it's nowhere near as good as it used to be. Shame because it's a cool place!~~#~0
Went to El Encanto for Restaurant Week 2009.  Took an hour to drive there from my home in Avondale, but it was well worth the drive.  Driving into Cave Creek, was so fun.  Reminded me of Sedona or a cute, little western town.  Sat outside near the pond.  I highly recommend sitting outside.  Watching the ducks, especially the ones with the fro's on their heads, was so funny.  The food was really good, but the environment was the best part.  I recommend driving out to El Encanto, especially for date night or a big group dinner.  Be careful though, sometimes the ducks get too close and bite you!  My friend's butt was particularly delicious to them.  Ha, ha!~~#~0
Love the concept. Each item on the menu (the entirety of the plate) is under 475 calories. New, healthy me, wanted to absolutely love this place. Reasonable me ended up liking it, but found it was too expensive for what you get.We ordered chicken skewers as an appetizer, each had an entree and each got a dessert shooter. We wanted to try the full effect of Seasons 52.I had the lamb t-bone entree with truffle mashed potatoes and asparagus. I liked the lamb, the potatoes were good, and the portions were surprisingly not tiny given how the dish is under 475 calories. My wife had a salmon dish which she liked, but didn't love. We finished off the meal with a dessert shooter, which is a fun concept, and was pretty tasty. Service throughout the meal was good and attentive, if not a tad over the top towards the end.My issue with this place is the price. We ordered one soda (I had water), one appetizer, two entrees and the two mini desserts, and after tax and tip our bill was $85. I'm 100% OK with spending $85 on a great dinner, but the food was neither good enough nor filling enough to justify that price. The dessert shooters were only $2.50, so it's the entrees that kill you. I suppose if we'd avoided the appetizer and gotten slightly less expensive entrees (my lamb was $26 and my wife's fish was $23), it would have been more reasonable...Still, $85 gets two people a great meal at a lot of places, including an appetizer and dessert. Considering that we weren't drinking that night, the bill just seemed too high for what we got.Again, I love the concept, and the food is pretty good, but I'm hard pressed  to spend that kind of money on food that's neither exceptional nor completely filling, in an atmosphere that doesn't warrant their price points. I could see trying this place for lunch, but I don't think I'll be back for dinner anytime soon.~~#~0
If your are a "Soccer Mom with a BMW" you will see all your friends there. Better than the STARB, nice old house. "Yoga & Kaffine" ? ba jern dawLiked it when it was Coffe Talk  it is still ok but has been yuppifyed...~~#~0
Great place to enjoy a lovely view. We went for lunch on a Sunday. The day was perfect and the views remind me of why people come to the valley. The three of us were satisfied with our meals. I think my prime rib french dip won over the chicken pot pie or kobe burger, although all were good. It seemed quite casual and the service was also. It lent to the layed back tranquility. I wouldnt go there in a rush.Thought the happy hour looked enticing although it is too far afield to drink and then have to get home. We shall return!!!Came back a second time and was disappointed in our meals that took forever to get after ordering. It was good, not great. Loved the Bloody Mary Bar.~~#~0
Go here for liquor and bloody mary mix not wine. I get my wine from my nephew that is a wine maker in Santa Barbara so suck it you AZ wine people! Like BevMo MO Yo!~~#~0
We waited for ever at our table. Bathrooms were out of service. Waited even longer to get the food. Must have been the cooks night off. Food was awful. Even the kids complained. The pickles were still great. Daughter cleaned them out again. Really disappointed this night. Will stick to the one down in Tempe.~~#~0
This place is OK. Nothing phenomenal. The breakfast burritos are OK, which is weird as usually they are absolutely tasty. I eat here pretty regularly as it is next to my job. It is definitely not bad. Just nothing to really blow you away. I did have one of the shrimp specials ($11!) and it was indeed excellent. I wish they made their own horchata, or at least pretended they did. Watching them poor it out of the bottle I could buy is rather underwhelming. Not all of their Mexican coke is made with cane sugar (the number one reason I drink Mexican coke). so watch for that. If you are near and hungry, stop in! I wouldn't bring people or make a special trip though.~~#~0
I'm glad I didn't get a chance to read the reviews here before I had my first visit, or I may not have given McGrath's a chance!  I arrived shortly after 11a (when my first visit to White Chocolate Grill turned out to be a bust since all of their breads contained corn syrup or some other allergen and so did the desserts- it struck me that the server had had enough of checking with the kitchen, so I decided I'd save him more trouble and take my business elsewhere) and was one of their first customers, so perhaps this led to my not having any problems with service.  I found it refreshing to be able to ask the manager, who served as the host that morning, many questions and have him immediately know the answers (he only had to go back maybe twice).  This means that I don't get to annoy my server as much, although the server that day was very friendly and understanding- she also has a few food allergies to grapple with!I had the parmesan-crusted cod, with veggies and wild rice.  However, the rice had allergens, but the server didn't even hesitate to ask what I'd like to substitute it with.  No frowns, no annoyed pauses.  Excellent service.  Afterwards, she even offered a complimentary birthday sundae!~~#~0
Hopefully, third time's the charm. Heavenly is now the third Filipino bakery to open in this same spot in the Lee Lee's shopping center. First impression, clean, lots of product on shelves to choose from, friendly customer service.   I was only able to quickly eye their goodies, before my little one started trying to rearrange their product display, dropping a package of "Palitaw" on the floor. It didn't pop open, but I bought it anyway, since the fall made it's contents all jumbled up. Good thing I have fond memories of this treat from New Years in my Mamalo's house back home. I also ordered one of their Cheese pastries. Curious if it tasted like or better than the previous owners flaky cheese pastry. I paid with my debit (couldn't do that with the previous bakery) so that's a plus. While paying, I noticed off the back left of the store behind the register, was a refrigerator stacked with ready made take home dishes, like menudo, If i recall correctly. So, next time I'll definitely take one home, but, I didn't this time, because I still had to do my grocery shopping at LeeLee's. Once home, I tried the Palitaw. It was soft and pleasantly chewy with a non-sweet powdery coating. I think I recall coconut flakes on the ones my dad made for me back home. I'm not sure what the powdery coating is, it's got a subtle flavor of perhaps toasted crushed rice.  But, It might not be something everyone would like. If I were to compare it to something, it reminds me of mochi.  which i love.   I put these in the fridge and they didn't get hard.  I didn't treat the cheese pastry with care as I shopped around that day. When I got home to open the bag, it's top layer was almost all flaked off. So, I'll be ordering this again & eating straight from the case next time. Overall it was light and flaky and not greasy. The cheese filling was also nice, not too sweet.   My toddler loved this treat and that it wasn't overly sweet was good for her too.  I'd love it if they make another variation with some kind of fruit to contrast the cheese.  I'd like to go back without my little one, so that I can fully experience all that this 1 month new bakery has to offer & take better photos.  I'm giving them a middle of the board solid rating of 3 stars, A-OK.  I am expecting that on my next visit, Heavenly will be getting more stars.~~#~0
I don't come here that often as I'm not in Tempe very much. Last time I went there they got my order wrong which is always annoying, but they fixed it. No big deal. I've been here probably half a dozen times, and I'd say it's more like a 3.5 star, but I can't quite justify 4. This definitely a "throw a lot of things into this sandwich because it might taste better" kind of place, a la Paradise. I'm a very basic eater, so I don't need 9 ingredients in a sandwich, but whatevs, some people like it.~~#~0
Everyone in Phoenix has been to Fez besides my hubby and I...until now. We stopped on our way to see an awesome movie at Filmbar(see next review). From the street, this place looked super hopping. We were nervous because we did not have time to wait for a table. It was a Monday, for gosh sakes, I could not believe this place was packed! When we walked in, we realized it was a facade; the inside of the restaurant was pretty empty and the patio was not as packed as I thought. The bar is super cool, but we decided to sit outside. Anyone who knows me will think this comment is weird, but the whole allowing smoking on the patio is a fail. Because the space has a ceiling, it seems pretty compact, so the 2 smokers on the patio kind of filled the place with smoke. Typically I am not opposed, but because we were not drinking and it was an early Monday evening, the smoke was a bit much. I would definitely be more inclined to not mention the smoke on a weekend. Anyway, the hubby and I decided to split the bruschetta and the Tangier Burger. We stuck to iced tea after over-imbibing over the weekend. Our waitress was very sweet and attentive. She brought our food out shortly after we ordered. The burger was perfect; perfectly prepared and the sauces simply complimented the burger and bun. I would definitely get it again. I did not like the sweet potato fries, simply because I am not a fan of sweets, but my hubby loved them. Not as pumped about the bruschetta. It comes with several different types of bread and is more of a dipping bruschetta. It came with ramekins of artichoke dip, yummy pesto, and some kind of tomato saucy dip. Not bad but just not that excited about it. Seemed kinda bread sticky instead of bruschetta-ish. We will definitely return to try their Margaritas, which looked fabulous. I suggest splitting the burger because its huge!~~#~0
[Right at about 3.5 stars for food and service.] Finding myself here as the first to join of group of Yelpers at their international supper, the restaurant was ready for the 15 or so that had said they were "IN" .  They were anxiously awaiting our arrival.  Slowly a few more wander in 6 in all.  They were ready, releaved yet slightly disapointed that more didn't show.  I found the sides/banchan to be good and plentiful, the kimchee and the dakon radish were very good as was an apple salad that tasted much like a waldorf salad with a mayo dressing.  This was the first time I had been presented with roasted seaweed/nori at the table, which I enjoy. Ordering the Kalbi, I didn't stray far from what I love.  But I did try some of Lindsey's Bulgogi.  Quite tasty as well.  The prices were comprable to Hoodori and I would have to say the atmosphere is about the same. Clean and simple cafe style.  If your are looking for quality Korean fare...this is a worthy stop!~~#~0
Went here the other day.  It happened to be a Friday, and I noticed on the outside there was a sign saying there was sesame chicken and golden fried fish on Fridays. Jackpot!Not your typical buffet line, more like cafeteria-style, but you still serve yourself.  There is a sign at the beginning of the buffet lecturing you to eat everything you take, which I didn't see until after I had gone through once and had a small mound of dry, dry, dry fried rice on my plate that I didn't touch more than twice.  It really wasn't good.  The hot and sour soup was also a pass.  It tasted like nothing - just spicy and bland.  I added some soy sauce but it didn't help.Several other items made up for this though.  The sesame chicken was GOOD, still crispy somehow, and white meat, really sticky.  I enjoyed it, even if it seemed more like a crispy honey chicken to me.  The fried fish was also good, they had some tartar sauce at the end of the line.  I liked the teryaki chicken with its sauce, and the lo mein (why are people saying it's spam? it was definitely chicken).  The fries were also great, clearly homemade but good and crispy. I'll probably go back here, especially if it's on a Friday.~~#~0
Great for hangovers during the world cup.  Quite tasty but nowhere near the best.~~#~0
I can only speak of the bar scene, and not of the food.  It was a good time!  Wish they had been playing better music, however.~~#~0
For a while I saw this place being built and finally it opened.  I was excited to finally try it, but I went a while before I actually did.Im a huge fan of anything chicken and I guess I thought this was a wing place before seeing that it was literally all chicken fingers.  Ok, no problem.The food is good.. but nothing blew me away.  I ordered their 4 chicken finger meal, which I guess is very popular.  It came with a side of fries, a piece of garlic bread and some slaw.  My favorite coleslaw is still the one from KFC.  The bread was soft and tasty and the chicken was ok.  The sauce they gave you to dip it in helped.So it was good.  Would I go back? Sure, but it wouldn't be my first choice.~~#~0
Like most people I've been to my fair share of Starbucks. Whoa now that i think about it i've probably been to more than 50 in around 10 states. scary. hmm. well anyway, THIS starbucks on Camelback b/t 16th and 18th streets. blech. meh. kinda gross.first of all this Starbucks is dirtier than most Phx/AZ Starbucks. i don't know why exactly. maybe it's the disjointed layout that has a shared patio both in front and in back of the store, making it SEEM less tidy since it's a shared space with other local businesses without the standard Sbux quality control (such as the Zoe's next door). still though: not the nicest Starbucks. ALSO: the employees don't maintain the outdoor/patio area as often as they should... or, like ever. i've been to this location dozens of times and have not witnessed a Starbucks worker with rag and broom in hand tending to the exterior. boo.and in true lazy L.A. fashion, the tables always seemed to be SLAMMED with dudes working on lap tops and/or listening to headphones. if i'm a business owner, my LEAST favorite decor is the slacker or semi-professional male lounging in my coffee shop for more than 1 hr at a time. GO! GO! shoo, you, shoo! i feel like coffee shop lap top dudes are like cats. you have to spray them with water bottles to move em away from no-no areas.ANYWAY, the drinks - ok. not the best, not the worst. Starbucks is quasi-putrid smelly coffee that delivers on the caffeine and sugar, but never the subtle beauty of a good coffee. we all know it. but they're just so damn ubiquitous that we go anyway.the STAFF - hit and miss. some are cool. some are WAY haggard. very up and down w/ the customer service at this location. there needs to be more consistency and less attitude from some of the more "don't want to be here" employees. hey man, you can make $10/hr at a lot of places. don't mess with the tried and true Starbucks formula for pretty good customer service.but i digress. plenty of parking in the lot surrounding this place but near inaccessible (like most of phoenix) to pedestrians. OVERALL: meh. weak location.~~#~0
Sushi...fast food style. Basically a step above the sushi at Fry's but good if you want a quick, cheap meal.~~#~0
Went with a buddy, ordered an alfredo chicken pasta and he got a calzone. Service was good, they were very friendly. Food was decent, if I went back, it would be because of the great service. I should have tried their pizza, but I guess next time.~~#~0
We wanted to see what the hype was about this place, so my lady and I crawled out of bed at noon and came here for lunch. We came on a Saturday afternoon, there were a few people dining in. I had the carne asada burrito and my girl had the carne asada tacos. The food was tasty, and hot. I'm sure about how I feel about all they hoopla over this place. It was a decent place to grab a bite to eat. The Horchata was good, and they sell Mexican Coca-Cola. The price was all right, but you could definitely get carne asada at a Filibertos or any of the other 'Bertos for that matter that was just as tasty and for a few less dollars.*Update* I received an email from the proprietor of this Taco shop, he stated to me that "if you can not see the difference in quality from us and the other "Bertos", maybe this isn't the place for you"...I'm not sure why a restaurant owner would shoo away a guest, especially a guest who said the food was good, he was just not understanding of the hype. So if you're like me, and think Filibertos is good, keep going there, because obviously, the owner of this establishment doesn't need our business~~#~0
I always past by this place but this is my first time trying it.  I had the Tuna Crunch Salad.  It was good but nothing special.  It was for lunch and I was in a hurry so I didn't have anything else.  But the flavors and textures weren't that special for the price.~~#~0
This was my second time doing the half and was not that impressed this year. I paid almost $100 for a registration fee, which is fine, but the swag bag only had a few samples and mostly flyers, and the bands seemed to be recycled from years' past. I was also surprised there weren't more bands. What made it great for me were the locals that came out with their signs, well wishes, cheers, and in one case, beer for the runners! I don't remember this the first time I did the half, three years ago, but I liked the one free beer for finishers. I also thought the shirt was a huge step up from the typical T-shirt. My husband had a very difficult time getting a spot along the finish and commented that it could have been easier for spectators. Overall, I enjoyed myself but the race they put on was just okay.~~#~0
I like this Basha's.... its local, and convenient. I don't tink they are the cheapest place in town to shop... but it's around the corner from where I live. I also like supporting local Arizona business.The staff at this Basha's is always very friendly, and I like to frequent one store so you get to know the staff.~~#~0
These burgers are A-OK, I like that you can get a small, medium, large, x-large, and super large sized burgers.  I ordered a medium and it was a little juicy (not bad for a fast food burger) but I would still say that 5 guys or Smashburger is a little better.  Still these guys don't make a bad burger at all and I would stop in again and recommend it if you are a burger connoisseur that needs to taste every burger.  I like that this location is close to my office and I was headed to Culver's before I came here but that place smelled so bad inside I had to walk out.  I also like the atmosphere here, it is a nice clean casual looking place and comfortable to enjoy a quick lunch.~~#~0
This review is more about the ARIZONA'S ULTIMATE WOMAN'S EXPO on Oct 17th & 18th, which was held in the South Building of the Convention Center (the section that wasn't remodeled).Kudos for plenty of clean restrooms that can be found in the lobby and inside the show (FREE maxi pads available...just in case).This Woman's Expo didn't let the large crowds of anxious women in the Expo until 10:15am...thanks for the announcement or update! BAD! $10 bucks to get in (and $10 for parking).The show boosted that they had 500 Exhibitors, I didn't count, but I don't think there were that many...perhaps 1/2 of that.I think this Expo is different than the one that has been hosted by Channel 3 (AZ Family) since the 90's....which has moved to the Glendale Stadium a few years ago (and is now smaller than the past shows which were downtown).Just expect overpriced, average food at ANY Convention Center snack bar. --HELLO, $6.50 for a hot dog?!! You could get dozens of hot dogs at Costco for that! Bring a sandwich in your bag or grab a bite nearby at the AZ Center or one of the restaurants that may be open on the weekend.There were lots of beverage samples....why do these booths feel the need to add frickin' sweeteners to the tea or coffee samples? How can I decide if the new Starbucks coffee is any good when it's heavily laced with crappy liquid sweeteners? Why does the lady at the Natural Green Tea booth look at me like I'm an alien because I wanted to try their PLAIN green tea without some FAKE "natural" sugar that was added to it?overall, lots of free samples from many businesses...I guess I have enough free promo pens to last me for many years now.~~#~0
Last night was our Anniversary and Indian is our favorite so on a strong recommendation from a co worked we celebrated here. The place is big and nice inside and it was very clean. It was 8:30 when we arrived so the buffet was pretty empty so we just ordered off the menu. we both got Indian beers and they came in frosty mugs so we loved that. we ordered veggie samosa and they were straight off the buffet so they were heat lamp warm, disappointing since we ordered them off the menu we figured the would be hot and fresh. I ordered the vegetarian dinner with paneer tikka masala, the paneer had been sitting in the sauce a long time as it was orange all the way through and was as chewy as a rubber ball, didn't eat it. the rest of the meal was good but the temp of everything was like it had come off the buffet, we also like our Indian HOT so we ordered accordingly and there was NO heat in anything we got so they brought us some hot sauce to add to it and that was super mild as well :( my dinner also came with dessert and coffee or tea I ordered tea but it never came and my dessert again was brought off the buffet.  Our bill came to $51 +tip so kinda pricey but we did have a beer each.There was a strong language barrier between us and the waiter we kinda felt like we were on a customer service call and we had been patched over to Indian and couldn't quite get on the same page. the rest of the people that worked there were nice and helpful but I don't think we will make the drive out again as we live in Arrowhead .~~#~0
Do yourself a favor and have your pizza delivered. The location is sketchy at best, but they have decent pizza and excellent prices.  Barro's doesn't skimp on sauce or toppings.  The cheese bread sticks are awesome, as are the dessert bread sticks....so I have been told. ;)  Delivery is quick and they get the order right.  That makes Barro's A-OK with me!~~#~0
PV mall is the mall I go to when I don't want to spend a lot of time shopping. It's small and easy to navigate so I can usually get in and out really fast. PV mall isn't an awful mall, it's just very plain Jane. The movie theater is gone, it needs a makeover, and nothing about it really sticks out. The food court changes so much, and that can become annoying. Last I saw they added in a place called Hot Dog on a Stick! Don't be looking for my review on that one..Gross! All and all PV mall just can't compete with all the new shopping malls in the area such as Desert Ridge and Kierland. But seriously if you want a more quiet and fast shopping experience go to PV at daytime during the week. No hassle!~~#~0
Decent size park with lots of grass and benches lining the walls.  When we went here it was very muddy though in certain places, so if you have a dog that likes to roll around in the mud, beware!  There is one large fountain with water available at human and dog level.  The grounds themselves are a bit smelly; throughout most of the dog park I could smell dog poop.  There are various stations filled with bags for you to use though.  My dog had a pretty good time running around, sniffing things, and wandering around.  For the most part this park is secure, but at the entrance there is a wider opening at the door that very small dogs could slip through.  For now it's been blocked by a large jug of water.~~#~0
Amazing honey hot wings! Not easy to eat when the restaraunt is just as hot as the wings.... miserable! Not sure if it was the volume of people present or if the A/C was down. Ick.~~#~0
My Mom and I stayed there 9.10-13.2012. We didn't make a reservation, just showed up about 8.30pm. The mgr. at the desk was very helpful and nice.2 queen beds and a very clean room. The beds were very comfortable. It was pretty quiet never heard anything outside the room.It does have a free shuttle to downtown, but since we drove in and most of buisness was in Phoenix we never used it.Breakfast area clean and well stocked.It had a make your own belgian waffle maker. yum. Other breakfast items were an egg dish and a side. Cold & hot cereals were available as were pastries, yoghurts, fresh fruit salad, bagels & breads for toasting. The coffee was good and there were 3 types available. There were also packets for hot chocolate and tea bags.The breakfast room staff was very friendly and I am kicking myself for not remembering her name. She greeted everyone who entered and made sure the area was always stocked. I am not an early riser, breakfast is 6a-10a, but I ate breakfast everyday and not just becuse it was included in the room price. It was really good. Definitely, worth a return visit.~~#~0
We just had a beer and it was a good beer.  It was a hot afternoon and we were thirsty.  Read the reviews while sitting in there and was not too enticed to return. But I would probably give them a chance if I was in the area again.~~#~0
The only good thing about this place is getting to ride the mechanical bull.  It was empty both nights we stopped by.  At least I get to mark something off my bucket list!~~#~0
Alright, let me start this off by saying that I had a hard time deciding if I wanted to rate this place 3 or 4 stars.  My initial reaction was a 4, but there are a few things that really bug me here, so I really would say it's more of a 3.5The first negative is parking.  The lot behind the restaurant is ALWAYS full, and good luck finding a close spot on the street.  There's an apartment complex across the street that people try to park in, but you're really taking your chances; I've seen cars towed from the lot.  Next, this place is always so busy.  Recently if I drive by and see it's totally crammed, I just keep on driving.  It's not worth the hassle. Food here is hit or miss for me.  There are certain menu items (appetizers, burgers, daily specials) that are great, and there are others (fish & chips and the pizza) that are just not good in my opinion.  My best advise is find a few dishes you do like, and stick with those:)  The beers here are good, but not phenomenal; it would be nice to see 4 Peaks expand as a brewery with new beers.  The Pumpkin porter here is just so damn good though.  Honestly!  People wait year round, anticipating this beer.The patio here is superb; a great place to spend time people watching and enjoying the weather.  I tend to shy away from here during the summer since the building is open and only has a swamp cooler.  You're either melting on the patio or full of sweat inside.  Gross.All complaints aside, I love this place.  The atmosphere here is laid back and friendly.  Service is always great and food comes out very speedy.  I definitely recommend coming here with friends~~#~0
Wow, what a relief.  I am so glad to see an average Yelp rating of 3 stars.  I was worried that I was crazy because when I arrived, I read multiple "Best of..." awards (you know the ones), but by the time the meal was over, I was thinking, "Best of what!?"  I am so glad my fellow Yelpers agreed with me: this place has great atmosphere, but the food is average at best.To their credit, I walked through an incredibly great patio, perfect for Arizona winters, on my way to the main entrance.  But it reminds me of Tortilla Factory in Scottsdale.  You don't go for the food.  You go for the patio.~~#~0
This is a great place to visit if you are looking for a sports bar.  They have a huge projection TV as well as many other TVs around the whole restaurant.  It is a great atmosphere for those people who want to watch the "big game."  I would say the food is mediocre and nothing to rave about.  The garlic fries are good but make me feel very unhealthy after eating them.  This is supposed to be similar to Hooters with the waitresses wearing revealing clothing and kilts.They also have very odd humor in their menu that maybe a Californian would not understand.  Also the music selection is really odd for a sports bar.Pros:  Great sports barCons:  Mediocre food and odd music~~#~0
JUST as I was about to lose my mind at BestBuy looking at new laptops.. and just wishing the MAC was all I wanted it to be , but isnt because Im a hard to please girl, you know! I got my escape near the land of electronics and techy gadgets.. Im just a straight out vanilla girl.. keep it simple.. add some fresh framboise! And Im a happy simple girl.. Mark, on the other hand likes his a bit more tart.. she gave a sample of pomegranate blueberry.. he loved it.. I didnt .. wow.. thats a lot to confuse my taste buds with.. but its not the fault of BerryGood, thats just my palate! The 3 is because Im a yogurt snob.. I compare all things yogurt to PinkBerry in Cali.. and its no PinkBerry.. its just a loss on cream factor to me.. but the raspberries and fresh fruit, though limited.. are just that.. super fresh:-)~~#~0
I am not a big BBQ eater but this place was pretty good. My friends like it so I go with them from time to time. It would not be my choice for dining but the times I have been there were pretty good and the food too. Not very expensive and right at Tempe Marketplace. The service was good and beer cold. My favorite was the corn bread and sweet tea.~~#~0
I really like The Turf. I would love to love it, but there is nothing that outstanding or memorable to make me do so. The food is good. I like the menu and diversity of it. It's clean, somewhat hip though has the "I have seen this before" look. Prices are average, drink menu and selection is average, and service is average. Certainly a place I like to come to for a drink and some lunch or dinner. There is a small patio out front, a large dining area with booths and tables. TV's, live music at times, and a comfortable crowd. I really wish I had more to say. It's just "average". Not anything overly memorable. Just a place to hit if in the area and you will probably have a nice experience. Yawn.~~#~0
As many a wise person has already said, this place should be called "Whole Paycheck."  I'm into organic, naturally sourced food, and this location is right around the corner from my house.  By default, I end up going here.  They have a stellar selection of wines and cheeses, and I like both, so well, Whole Foods, you had me at cheddar!  It's fun making your own peanut butter or almond butter with the self-serve grinders.  The produce selection is always vast, featuring local and in season items where necessary.  One time I went, they even had fiddlehead ferns for consumption.My main complaint is the staff sometimes seems lax.  I never get the local flavour that is so enjoyable when one is going to a place like this.  The product selection is less than most Whole Foods, but I suspect that has more to do with the reduced square footage of the Tempe location.Good, but not great.~~#~0
Always clean and the have a blockbuster blue box rental in the back by the bathrooms.~~#~0
This place gets an A for effort but a C for execution. After hearing so many people talk about LGO, my friend that was visiting from out of town and I decided to give it a whirl this past weekend. Because we went at 3:30pm on a Sunday, not quite lunch and not quite dinner, we didn't have a problem finding a parking spot. However, there was a line at the counter which was kind of annoying given that it didn't move very quickly. We grabbed some pre-made spicy tuna sushi (which was fresh and tasty, probably the highlight of the experience). We each ordered a sandwich, and they took FOREVER to come out (during which time we had to stand there balancing our waters and sushi and dodging the kids and strollers - because they can't just bring you your gourmet sandwich when it's done, and if you leave the room, you won't hear your name).My friend seemed satisfied with her Cuban, although she did comment that it wasn't very much food for the price. My grilled turkey and havarti was way overcooked. It wasn't burnt, but it was soooo hot. It needed to be taken off the grill about 3-5 minutes earlier, which would have also reduced the wait. The food was nothing amazing, and it took entirely too long given that it wasn't lunch time or dinner time. I'd hate to see the wait during peak hours.My friend also indulged us in a piece of red velvet cake. While it was very moist and delicious (the icing was superb), one sliver of cake was $7. Seriously?!?!? That is insane. I understand the need for a mark up, but that is ridiculous for a 1/2 inch slice of cake. The clientele also seemed uppity and snobby...not my cup of tea really. This place has such great potential....the atmosphere and concept are neat, but the execution is off. The employees are just your run of the mill employees, seemingly apathetic about their work. It doesn't seem as though this place has any spunk or personality or genuine character. It comes across as though it's trying to be a hip, charming upscale corner deli, but the service and food just didn't appear genuine. I will give it another shot, but I am not rushing over there or planning to go out of my way for it any time soon.~~#~0
I've been here a few times. The beef brisket and a drink costs $12. The taste is average at best. I would suggest serving this dish without the bun and put the bbq sauce on the meat. Instead of letting the customer squeeze some sauce out of a bottle.The bratwurst is ok and the pulled pork is average, nothing that really blows you away. The seating at lunch is crowded and somehow needs to be re-configured with maybe a couple of dueces instead of all 4 seat tables. That way the single diners don't take up all the 4 spots.~~#~0
Pretty good brick oven pizza. my boss and his wife go here every time they come to Arizona and brought me along this year(4/11). They accidentally burned one of the pizzas and it took quite some time before it came so they gave it to us no charge. thats good business. the staff was very friendly and the atmosphere is nice, though for some it might seem a little crowded. definitely worth to check it out~~#~0
Lux is scene. I was amazed to see how packed the coffee shop was at 1030AM, aren't people supposed to be at work?! Anyway, the line was halfway to the door when I stepped into the fray but we moved quickly. I ordered an espresso and bought a "healthy" muffin filled with blueberries, carrots, possibly zucchini, an apple slice and covered in oats. It was like a brick in my stomach. I don't know, I guess I don't get the whole "hang out in a coffee bar" thing. Especially students. Guess what guys there is a great place you can take your laptop and 30 textbooks and study in peace and quiet...a library. go there. Lux is cramped but everyone seems to love it. I'm all for independent businesses so Lux is A-Ok with me.~~#~0
Three stars it is...The food was adequate...an ok choice if you are seeking refuge from one of the neighboring hotels.   You will not have a memorable dining experience here, so not a good choice for a date.Food - ok, but everything is heavily salted ( I guess it helps prevent dehydration ).Service - ok.   Do I really have to ask for water in Phoenix?Decor - ok.  But for the price, perhaps a table cloth or sheet of paper...Wine list -  as long as you like their choices of mass market wines priced by the glass the same as the bottle price at your local grocer I guess it's ok.~~#~0
Tried the Bacon Double Cheese Burger topped with lettuce, tomato, pickles, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, green peppers, and mustard. Also had the Regular FriesThe Good News:The burgers had a nice charbroiled flavor and cooked well as advertised.The cheese and the toppings were tasty and plentiful. I liked idea of crumbled bacon instead of strips.I would agree with the published reviews that their fries are the best I've had at a fast food hamburger franchise. The serving size was also generous and a good deal and I liked eating my fries from the cup, which made it easier to add plenty of ketchup the way I like.Enjoyed munching on the free peanuts while we waited for our order.Service was quick and pleasant.Their drink dispenser, what I have decided to call a "Coke Replicator", was cool.The Rest of the Story:The burgers were not juicy as advertised and, therefore, not as flavorful as some other fast food franchise hamburgers.The bacon on my burger was overcooked and, therefore, did not add as much flavor to the sandwich as I would like.The green peppers would have been better grilled like the other toppings.The bun was rather limp and not what I would have expected from a place like this.The Verdict:The most important reason for going to burger joint is to enjoy a juicy, flavorful hamburger and that was not achieved. The fries compensated a lot, but not enough to make it a truly memorable experience. I do intend to try at least one more location.~~#~0
I only spent about an hour here so I will need to come back again to really get a better feel.  There was  cool chill music playing and the open-ness of the space was nice.  My drink was made well but I can't tell what was maybe missing?  It may have been that everyone was sitting?  I am used to bars with people sitting and standing.  I am a stander so maybe this is why I felt off?  I am interested to see if they get busier, it was pretty quiet for a Saturday night.~~#~0
I like to think of Z Pizza as the pizza chain for people who think they are being healthy and "cool" when they put fresh veggies on a pizza. I ordered a couple times when I used to live at 3rd street and Thomas and they would deliver to my house. I have to say, when they opened this location, I started thinking back to all my previous experiences and wasn't really that excited about this one opening, but it is something new nonetheless. I went in for lunch one day, and ordered a couple of slices, with a drink. It was like $6 and I was extremely..... extremely dissapointed. The girls behind the counter were very helpful, but that seemend to be the end of it. The pizza came out very quickly, which made me wonder to begin with but the damn things were still somewhat cold... and rock hard. It was some of the shittiest pizza slices I'd had in a long time. Most places are just warming up already made pizza, and at a lot of places it still rocks. NOT HERE. I'm sure the experience might be different if I ordered a whole pizza, but they wont deliver to my house 5 blocks away so I'm not gonna try. Hey, dumbasses, buy a $75 bicycle with a pizza rack on it and offer to deliver to local homes and businesses within like a half a mile. I GUARANTEE you will make your $75 investment back in a couple weeks or less. I have a totally indifferent opinion of the place, but would give it 4 stars if they got a bicycle delivery system in place.~~#~0
Over the years I've been a buyer, window shopper, seller and borrower at many pawn shops. I even worked at one for day. Pawn shops are great places to borrow money or score a good deal. They are one of the most easily accessible forms of credit around and are available to anyone who with a legal ID.Pawnshops vary greatly from shop to shop depending on local, city and state rules. They also vary based on how the owner decides to run them. In my experience there are 3 types of pawn shops; the retail store type, the crackhead-we'll-loan-money-to-anyone-that-comes-in-this-joint type and a hybrid of the two. There are variations as well with the our-guys-tote-guns type and the unarmed type and the we-hire-people-that-know-stuff type and the we-hire-people-that-know-nothing type.This shop seems to be a hybrid as far as knowledgable employees goes and as far as being unarmed goes in what seems to be a more friendly retail environment. While none of the people here have been downright rude to me a couple have acted condescending at times despite having zero knowledge about an item. Conversely, there are a couple of super friendly employees here.3 stars is "A-ok" and I won't argue with that for this place. They'll work with you, they'll cut deals, they'll make good loans, they'll negotiate prices for items for sale. I recommend dealing with the guy that smokes cigars whose name I believe is Dave. Knowledge and friendliness seem to be his strong-suit and he certainly understands the idea of long-term customer relations.Not a big shop, but a clean shop and better than a lot of shops in town.~~#~0
Not my favorite. The food was just ok. The service was good though. For my family of 5 we paid $35 so the prices are about the same you would pay anywhere else. I wont go back if i have a choice. To be more spacific I felt like this food was more American Mexican style food than authentic stuff.~~#~0
For my first visit here, I'm only giving this place 3 stars. This is a small little sushi place, so not really a place for large groups, but great for small intimate groups. My only concern, either way, is that it's not very private in the conversation department. It's that small....A little background music would have made this perfect--but this place did not deliver.Service was ok, i suppose. Our orders were simple, and we had water to drink, so not much to do--plus there were only two of us. The only saving grace was this: i wasn't so hungry i was about to gnaw my arm off (it took forever to get our food and we ordered 2 *simple* rolls a piece) and that i had great company filled with entertaining conversation. If those two things not had been factors in this dinner equation, this could have been much worse.I will say, however, the sushi was pretty good. Fresh fish, unique combinations, and it kept well for take out. I had to bring dinner home for someone and got the thumbs up from them. Seeing as how it was over an hour before i showed up with it after they brought it to me, that's a good sign, lol.I will definitely go back if given the chance, but it's not a place that is high on my radar. If the atmosphere was better i might feel differently.~~#~0
When you walk in, you get the feeling of walking into a NY pizzaria. The service, the pizza, & the build you own thin crust pizza was awesome!~~#~0
I used to live a stones throw from The Lost Leaf. It's an interesting place to hang when it's not crazy packed.They do have a lot of unique beers and wine, but there's a good chance they're out of what you want (unfortunately).If i still lived downtown I would come here more often. But, not really worth going out of your way w/ Sheriff Joe and all...~~#~0
I get here often as they are right across the street from a very good car wash in the area.  Their prices are above average compared to Lowes and Home Depot but the expertise here is amazing.  You will not find people as experienced and helpful like this at the other big stores.The only knock is that ultimately the selection is a fraction of what you would find at Lowes and Home Depot.For 99% of stuff, you'll find me here.~~#~0
Was at a event at Westworld and we drove around looking for a place to eat and came here about 8pm on a Saturday.  Not a lot of people inside, especially for a Saturday but we were hungry.  When the waitress came over she was very nice and chatty.  She took our orders and repeated everything back to assure she got it right, that's a good thing!Problem is than we waited and waited for our drinks and chips & salsa.  I am use to getting chips & salsa as soon as you sit down not 15 minutes after you have seated and ordered.  When we saw her come out with our drinks and chips she first went to another table and chatted for a little than came over and dropped off our stuff.  I figured she could have dropped our stuff off than chatted with the other customers.When our food came, it was good.  Nothing spectacular.  I had just truck tacos and got lots of steak with it.  My mom got hard taco and enchilada and enjoyed hers.  We also ordered mini apple chimi with ice cream.  I think that was the best of the meal.If I come back to this area may try out other restaurants before I make another visit.  Fun to try new places and see what another city has to offer!~~#~0
Food, really great.  Service, good. Atmosphere....great looking place, but not a really fun atmosphere.  Been here twice, Friday happy hour and a Wednesday dinner.  Friday at the bar was mildly busy, good bartenders.  Wednesday was dead, but food was great.  Great place to hit before going out to Scottsdale. Will be back, but not a sports, dance, bar type of place.  Drinks a bit pricy.  Margarita and a "specialty" drink, $18...on happy hour pricing.  A bit high....~~#~0
I have a love/hate relationship with Tee Pee. I love their chicken enchiladas, rice, beans and salsa.  The chicken fajita soft taco's that JD gets always look good too. But once I was seriously disappointed by the balloon-boy looking chile relleno thing. Last night we went expecting gooey cheesy goodness and a couple of margs and one of us left with a toothache. On a whim, JD ordered a mexican pizza with fajita chicken instead of ground beef. It came and looked so good I had to taste it. It tasted good too. I was impressed and things were looking great until Ccc-rack! The pizza had some unexpected metal in it. We told our server who later explained to us that the slicer used to cut the pizza had broken and left behind the rivet that JD tried to eat (?) That just seemed odd to us, and we both left with a bad taste in our mouths. The pizza wasn't on the bill, but it is definitely still on our minds.~~#~0
Seeing so many 5-star reviews,I almost feel bad giving them only 3 stars, but - it has to be said ... This is really a 5 star / 1 star review.  The food - undoubtedly 5 star; everything everyone says about the food is correct - fresh, top of the line, well prepared, well presented.  No question.  But - there are elements to the experience that to me completely ruin it, considering the price.  1) I call for a reservation; first a guy answers, talks to me nicely for a few minutes, then says 'let me transfer you to the hostess'; on hold listening to gibberish for a while, then; hostess asks me for my phone number ... ok, not sure why you need it but lets do it ...; "first name" ... ok, I guess you want that too; "last name" ... wtf, this is getting annoying ... but I give it anyway ... "can you spell that please" ...OMG ... if you have my phone number, and my first name, why do you need my last name?! ... and spelled out ... ?! It's a restaurant reservation, not an airline reservation! 2) We sit at the 'robato/sushi' bar.  Great view, watch all the action. Couldn't be better, except - there's an icy cold wind blowing down from the vents. Now, this is January - about 45 degrees outside. Thank goodness I was wearing a jacket and scarf, because I needed it - though I like to take off such things once I get inside.. I live in Phoenix because I LIKE THE WARMTH ... I don't want to be frozen to death while I eat (this is one of my pet peeves with many places in Phoenix ... it's as if they setup their A/C in July and just leave it on all through the winter ... either that or, the wait-staff and kitchen staff control the A/C and since they are running around being busy, they like the temp to be cold ... but we patrons are sitting idly, not exactly overheating! A new couple arrived and sat at my side, and asked 'is this cold to you?' - so this wasn't just me. 3) I was in the middle of an interesting conversation with my partner, when I heard "pardon the interruption; may I take your plate?".  The girl was a cute blonde, typical Scottsdale material.  If I'm in the middle of a conversation, I'm obviously busy, and being interrupted for the matter of a plate removal is just ... bad service.  If they are delivering hot, fresh, food, then of course interrupt me, but ... removal of empty plate? This, to me, smacks of lack of training ... any 'quality' server knows that you don't interrupt for no good reason.  We also had a few 'pardon my reach' comments, when they reached over to pour my beer. Now, if they want to avoid reaching, they could pour the beer on the serving tray, THEN reach over briefly to place on the table, but ... instead they place the empty glass on the table then lean over and pour for what seems like an age ... Again, food was fanstastic but these things detract from the overall experience.~~#~0
I left a tip, but a further review is necessary. I have to start out by saying that I was skeptical about coming here. But my wife hyped it so much for the bacon-fat popcorn. I was excited that they had chicken and waffles(as being a huge fan, and eating at many chicken/waffle places, i.e. Roscos in LA, LoLo's, etc.) I must say, honestly... pathetic. the chicken was over fried, dry, burnt and thigh meat to top it off. The waffle was a tiny 3inch square, with not syrup, but honey. And rather bland as well. Upon stating my dis-satisfaction to my waitress, she offered me my choice of different food from the menu. I chose the AZ BLT, per her request. And, I was blown away. the bacon was orgasmic(for lack of better terms), it buckled my knees with its perfection of tenderness and semi salty flavor. As a man who loves crispy bacon(almost burnt), this was a dance of flavor that is matched by few. The combination of the fresh greens, campari tomato, carmelized french bread and aioli mayo made this "basic" classic dance on the tastebuds. Total redemption was achieved, and I would recomend this place to anyone. Also, having happy hour 7 days a week does'nt hurt either. good prices and drinks.~~#~0
Great atmosphere and great food and specials.. service is a little horrible at times but the owners are great!~~#~0
100th review! I was hoping that for this milestone, I'd be reviewing something either spectacular or horrific. Well, Coyoacan is neither. It's right at the middle. It has some great stuff going for it, but it also has some improvements to make if it's going to rise in the star ratings and most importantly, convince people from other parts of the area to make the drive to South Phoenix. Coyoacan is located on Central, at the base of South Mountain and right between Spokes (now closed) and the famed Los Dos Molinos. The exterior is a dark and not particularly welcoming color and the neon painted words on the windows announcing the happy hour specials make the restaurant appear to be less formal than it actually is inside. When you go inside, the restaurant is surprisingly beautiful - the bar is long and curved, made out of a beautiful granite, and there are Brazilian art and artifacts and flowers placed throughout the room. The grill is just past the bar, so you can catch a glimpse of the chefs preparing the food. Coyoacan definitely gets credit for creating a romantic and interesting atmosphere. The first time I went here was with my dad, who was visiting from out of town. We had a lot to catch up on, and I specifically chose Coyoacan because I had heard that it was an upscale Brazilian steakhouse, and I assumed that it would be quieter/conducive to conversation. Instead, there was a band playing the loudest, most unpleasant Brazilian music. We had to shout to hear each other. The service was also disastrous. We ordered a salad that didn't come for 30 minutes, even though we were only one of 10-15 customers.  When the salad came, it was prepared differently than we had requested. Our server seemed more interesting in chatting with her friends or relatives at this one table than taking care of us. After finishing the salad, we waited for 20 minutes with no sign of our entrees. When we asked our server, she got snappy and insisted that "Good food takes time," a principle we wholeheartedly agreed with but weren't willing to accept with how hungry we were and how much our voices hurt from yelling. We ended up asking for the food to go and taking it home (where we could eat in peace and quiet). The steak we ordered was decent although not spectactular, but the grilled veggies and corn masa sides were delicious. All in all, not a great experience.Last week, my husband and I decided to give Coyocan another chance. We went during happy hour and sat at the bar. There was no band playing (although they were setting up). The bartender was really helpful and gave us great service. We ordered the house margaritas, which were 1/2 off for happy hour. They were really good - the mix was citrusy but not too sweet, they were appropriately strong, and the flavor went really well with the chips and salsa (which were also pretty good). We did notice that the manager/owner was sitting at the bar chatting with a bunch of friends and wasn't walking around interacting with customers. For our appetizer, we selected the beef taquitos. On the plus side, the portion was huge (five huge taquitos) and they were perfectly crispy without being too oily. The beef was a little dry, though. Our entrees came out promptly this time but they were a little disappointing given the price we paid. My husband got a slow-cooked pork ($17) and I got the prawns with plaintains and peppers ($26). Even though the pork was tender, the sauce was over-seasoned and practically drowned out the meat's flavor. My dish was not great - the plaintains were under-cooked, the prawns tasted really fishy, and the sauce was bland. For $26, I could get a really stellar entree elsewhere, so needless to say, I was disappointed. The beans and rice that came with the entree were decent, though. Coyoacan is a hard place to figure out - Is it a sophisticated steakhouse or a nightclub? Is it a steakhouse (as it labels itself) or simply a restaurant that serves Brazilian food (and three steaks)? Is the service only good at the bar, or was our experience an anomaly? Is it a place that's welcoming to guests of all types or just people who know the owners or employees? I think that the restaurant owners need to sort through some of these questions and establish a more concrete identity for the establishment. They also need to improve some of their dishes, especially the ones that are so pricey. I will definitely go back for the margaritas during happy hour, pre-band hours, but I probably won't spring for the food again.~~#~0
Wednesday, Girls' day for 4 (two rooms)Reservations-Making reservations = not seamless, took two phone calls and a facebook post to recover the summer deal on the rooms.Check-in...this hotel was desolate!  The pools, restaurants, halls, grounds were an expected AZ summertime wasteland.  Yet they stuck us with two rooms with a less-desirable view.  What?  You can't spare a golf course view or an upgrade during your 'off' season?  All four of our room keys failed, for two different doors, nothing like having to phone down and then WAIT!!!Concierge - left us messages to come see her for a special Starwood gift.  It was an apple shaped cookbook of apple recipes...ummm, I appreciate the thought, but what the heck does this have to do with AZ, Spa retreat, or luxury resort???  She also had unrelenting eye contact.  Very odd experience.Room - nice and neat.  Upon one use of toilet (#1 just so you know!), the toilet overflowed, which then had us calling for a handy-man and again another WAIT!!! Spa - + 30% off services for Phoenix residents on Wednesday!+ massage was awesome!!!!- small, scratchy spa towels- showers aren't the mulit-flow (rainforest) showers like most spas (disappointed with that)- hot tub right next to the restrooms, ewww!- It took FOREVER for the receptionist to charge 4 massages to one room number...again, another WAIT!!!  Pools...Adult Pool- Cabana reserved...NO other Cabana's reserved and they gave us the worst one, furthest form the pool.  What????  We moved, of course, but these are LOW rent Cabana's...I know this isn't Vegas, but 4 chairs, a table, a fan, and some iced water for $80??  - Bird POOP everywhere...on the chairs, on the umbrella's, on our clothes...ewwwwh!- Got 2 Midori margarita's in and they ran out of Midori.  WHAT kind of place is this???  + Coco, the pool guy was awesome!!  Very friendly, searched the grounds to get us another bottle of Midori, and took off the Cabana charge for our trouble.  That is good service!!  We love Coco!!Kids Pool+ The good thing was that there were hardly any kids so we could do the slides and lazy river with no trouble.  Don't get me wrong, I like kids, I have 2, but not when it is a girls' day.+ Slide was fun.- Tons of teens working their summer job...more interested in chatting it up with co-workers or totally uninterested/bored with the whole thing.Housekeeping...ignored the do not disturb and busted in on us around 9ish then argued with us about it.  So much for sleeping in!If this is how it is during the 'off' season, what is it like when this place is hoppin'?  It was OK, but did not live up to the hype of a Westin or Scottsdale resort.~~#~0
I really really wanted to love this place... I live within walking distance and saw a nearly 5 star review.  Unfortunately my visit had not only what would be considered slow service but rather no service.  I had to ask for every refill we received for breakfast, and ended up having to wait for our check for almost a half hour.  I will go back because of the great low prices as well as the quality of the food.  I hate to give a low score to a local joint with such an amazing potential, especially given the fact that service is rarely an issue.  I will go back but will leave this 3 star until then.~~#~0
I've eaten here many many times. I love Mexican food. Garcia's has a reputation slightly ahead of let's say, Manuel's or Pancho's, right? I love that they give you bean dip with your nachos and chunky salsa. I love that you can sit by the window and people watch while you eat. It IS loud in here, only because the mall is right outside. You can order a la carte and it's super cheap. So why am I giving it three stars? The last time I went with my husband and family and for some reason, I'm the only one in the group who got a minor case of food poisoning. When I get food poisoning, I'm gonna yelp about it. I was the only one who had chicken tortilla soup. I had to sit down on the bench outside the restaurant for ten minutes for fear it would come up. My skin felt like it was on fire. That's the only time it happened but since I've eaten there before just fine and love the atmosphere, I'm willing to return.~~#~0
Friendly. Good service. Average taste.~~#~0
Finally someone has made a breakfast pizza!  Thank you Maizie's!I ordered just that at Maizie's this past Sunday. The pizza is big enough for two people to share or enough for one hungry person. It came with Italian sausage, mushrooms, green chilies and topped with eggs prepared to your liking. Sounds kind of weird, but it was good. The service was very friendly, but mid way through being there service became very slow and almost non existant, it was understandable as this small cafe was starting to fill up with people and the servers were becoming busier. I'll definitely check Maizie's out again to try out some of their other dishes.~~#~0
So, not sure if was just what I ate but I didn't think it was great.  I had a lunch meeting and decided to try their falafel pita.  For $6 I thought it would have a side or something, but it was limpy lettuce, hardly any sauce, burnt falafel and a huge pita..it was ok but not great at all.  Others had the philly chicken pita and the garlic potatoes which looked really good but for what I had and paid, totally not worth it. Service was good and friendly and it only took about 10 minutes to be seated inside however, we had an annoying fly lingering around our table the entire time.   Since service was good, I will have to try the place again to see what people are really raving about!~~#~0
ALMOST everything about this place was good. I went there for my birthday to have a nice dinner. We ordered the veal picatta and chicken rosa (forget the exact name). The food was good. Our waiter was great. Everything was good until the end of our meal when we asked to take our $50 bottle of wine home. The manager came to our table and told us it was against the law to let us take a bottle of wine off the premise. Since I had went through the DLLC course only 3 weeks prior, I knew he was wrong. I tried to explain to him that he was incorrect, but he insisted that since he had been in the business for over 10 years that he was right and I was wrong. To make a long ass story short, I didn't take my bottle of wine home. That evening I emailed the DLLC and asked them about the law concerning the situation at Tutti Santi, and they responded:"Was the bottle of wine purchased with a meal? If so the statute 4-244 (32) states:It is unlawful for a licensee or employee to knowingly permit spirituous liquor to be removed from the licensed premises, except in the original unbroken package. This paragraph shall not apply to either of the following: A person who removes a bottle of wine which has been partially consumed in conjunction with a purchased meal from licensed premises if a cork is inserted flush with the top of the bottle or the bottle is otherwise securely closed."SO, Mr. Matteo, this is to you: You WERE wrong! Your professionalism was admirable, but professionalism can only go so far when you are WRONG!Moral of this review: Drink all of your wine.~~#~0
Loved their foodHas a little bit of an old people vibe though.... a bit dated....Honestly, the food was top notch.  I did see a giant cockroach run across the dining room floor though....   Hmm.....  I'm torn on how many stars to give this one.....Hmm.....I'll give 3 for exceptional food.-2 for the huge cockroach.~~#~0
I had stopped in also after stopping at lee lees to buy ingredients for home made Turon.  I was hoping to god they had my ensymada rolls with ube or macapuno in the middle but no luck.  I did however see a turnover with ube in it and also a roll with macapuno for 1.25 and 1.35.  I bought one of each and took them home to try them out.  The lady did not speak to me much and i had to say hello upon entering and what not. For some reasons Cebuanos tend to be more friendly towards me than i have had experiences with tagalog speaking filipinos.  I wore my manny pacquaio hoodie zip up but apparently she did not see the emblem.  As i got home i took the ube turnover out and took a bite. First initial reaction: Where is the ube???? Second reaction:  Why is the pastry part not sweeter?  I used to work at safeway bakerys and loved loved loved the turnovers and could not imagine why this did not wow me not only looking just like a triangle shaped turnover with sugar on top but it had ube in it! Should be wowing me at least! As for the macapuno turnover that looked like a pastry roll was very similar to the ube turnover just differently shaped.  i had to eat the top layer pull out the middle layer and the macapuno itself lacked a flavor the texture was there but not the flavor. I think i was so spoiled with goldilocks back home that nothing else can come close. If this bakery starts producing some red bean swirl loafs or ube rolls that are soft and decadent i will be more than happy and a satisfied customer but until then i will be on the look out for a filipino bakery that has at least one of my favorites whether it be ube or red bean bread, ube ensymada, or even some turon and carioca.  This bakeshop had all the little things i did not consume the most of at my aunts house parties. If they could combine the ube the kutsinta and the white doughy rice cakes like goldilocks has too i would even settle! If you are filipino or half like i am and know of some better places i would appreciate any information leading me to a more satisfied ending than what i have tried. =]~~#~0
Quick lunch option and for a great price .... $8.99 for the buffet (plus $2.49 for premium ingredients), which consists of a huge salad bar, 4-5 soups, three pasta dishes, dessert and frozen yogurt at the end.  Definitely worth the price and a great option for lunch.  Everything is always fresh and readily available~~#~0
The 3,000-square-foot, bilevel nightclub, which is operated by the former owners of Sail Inn, features DJs and live music nightly in a lounge setting. There are cozy sofas, a small dance floor, and a martini and food menu. You'll find a lot of college students hanging out here and local music fans kicking back at this chill Mill Avenue hangout.~~#~0
Since my last review in 2008 I have probably been here 20+ times. The food is always top notch, but I have to say since the recent expansion the service has really suffered. On each of my last 3 visits it has taken over an hour to get my food. I am patient (especially when the food is so delicious) but the lack of concern from the servers is a bit much. Last time I came in I ordered the tikka masala salad, now I know they may be busy, but over an hour for a salad is pretty poor service. The time before that I was served a cold pasty and you could tell it had sat for quite a while before making it to my table. Each time I pointed these things out and was met with blank stares or a passive "we're working on it."I think I will wait a couple of months before returning so they work out the kinks in their service. I still love the food, but I don't usually have 2 hours for lunch.~~#~0
Manuel's personifies Mexican food in Phoenix--Nothing amazing, but very satisfying nonetheless.Manuel's simply has a huge variety of items including the Americanized treats that are cheese crisps and chimichangas, and all are prepared effectively, if not spectacularly.Is it a Mi Nidito, El Charro, or La Parilla Suiza, three mainstays of the Tucson Mexican food scene? No way, no how. But if you're in Phoenix, alas there isn't much of that caliber to choose from. Manuel's has several locations in Phoenix, so they're convenient, the service is usually pretty good, and the food quality is consistent and generally quite satisfying.With realistic expectations, a pretty reliable choice for (Phoenix) Mexican food.~~#~0
This place used to be very good before it moved, i went to their new location and i must say it is not all that, the atmosphere feels too much like a restaurant and the outside nice seating to smoke a hooka is almost non existent, the music is too loud inside and they don't play enough arabic music anymore! I think they need to go back to Basics!~~#~0
Pros: quick check in, big room, great bathroom, very clean, really good breakfast and service at ZuZuCons: small beds (haven't stayed in a room with two doubles in a long time, the size of the room easily could have accommodated two queens), having to wait for a pool chair on Saturday at 4pm, being required to purchase tickets to the pool party on Sunday even though we were registered guests of the hotel.  Overall, the hotel is really clean and in fantastic condition for how old the buildings are. The decor is a perfect combination of retro and modern and service was good.  However, the pool experience was extremely disappointing and completely took away from the stay.  If I'm looking for a one day party, I'll know where to go, but if I'm looking for a staycation with ample pool time, I'll go somewhere else.~~#~0
Very clean, good beer selection and $1.50 fish tacos on tues.  Pretty good tacos to boot.  Of course I rate my stars vs. their expectation and this place is darn good and for the money it gets 4-5 stars.  Service was good too!~~#~0
Last weekend was the first time I ever stayed at the Hyatt Regency Resort in Scottsdale and I have to say that my experience was mediocre.  Upon arrival, the staff was very friendly and even offered my wife and I a complimentary prickly-pair margarita, which was beyond our expectations.The downside was the resort was nice, but not worth paying full price for the room we had. We were able to get a good last minute deal, but I would have complained if we didn't get a discount. My biggest complaint of all was house-keeping woke us up at 8 in the morning.  We didn't have our do not disturb sign out, but when you pay top dollar to stay at a nice resort, you shouldn't be woken up in the morning so they can clean your room.  She must have knocked on our door 3 or 4 times before I woke up and when she started to get her keys out I told her the room was occupied and to leave us alone.  After that, I could not go back to sleep, so that is why I only gave them 3 stars~~#~0
3.5 actually.Went to Nee House finally as it's a much easier drive than other Cantonese joints we frequent either in the west valley, Mesa or Chandler and being that I was in a lobster kind of mood we ventured there to try their best. We ordered the black bean version as our family typically orders the vanilla ginger and scallions so it turned out to be a good change up although I'm not a huge fan of the overwhelming volume of black pepper and onion condiment it's stir fried with (fortunately that's not included in the $/pound calculation. Tonite's market value was $15.99/lb. Warning all lobsters start at 2 or 2.5lbs so for two its easily either your main and only protein dish or a good take home portion for leftovers. However due to seafood restrictions at work a problemo for me to bring as tomr's bento filler out of courtesy to my colleagues. Lobster was succulent and cooked to a good tender texture as some places over cook it to a rubbery disaster. I thought the seasoning could've been more heavier on the black bean as the garlic  overpowered the dish as well as the abundance of bell peppers.Other sides we went for were hubby's fave eggplant and garlic sauce along with stir fried peashoots which is a staple in dining out Cantonese menus. Average taste and not disappointing and also not a bad location for us going forward as we'd like to try other faves like crispy egg noodle stir frys as well as the hot pots.They do get much take out traffic but for any seafood always eat at the table and fresh!~~#~0
It was OK. Service was friendly, but slow. Food was OK, but I don't think it was a good value.~~#~0
We couldn't get into Ocean Club, so we ended up at RA Sushi.  A very cool & chic ambiance.  Menu was good and looks like it's a fun place.However, I was very annoyed at the level of service.  We ordered 3 things...  and she forgot one of them.  I mean really?  I didn't make a big deal of it as we weren't in a hurry.  Would we go back?  Only if we couldn't get a table at the Ocean Club.~~#~0
Such a beautiful place! I really love learning about the native plants and getting to see them displayed and highlighted to their best advantage. Anyone who doesn't think the desert can be beautiful needs to come here. In fact, all AZ residents should really come here at least once. As long as the weather is nice, walking the paths at your own pace (hopefully with someone you love) is a great way to spend an afternoon. I agree with some of the other reviewers that now that the price has gone up to $15, it does make it a little less practical. But it is still a great option for those occasions when you have friends in from out of town or on holiday weeks when you need a fun activity that the whole family will enjoy. I was contemplating getting a membership but they are quite expensive and you still don't even get in for free to the special events like Avant-Garden or the evening concerts so it is just not worth it.~~#~0
I'm sure many of you are looking forward to your Friday night, especially being First Friday and all.  Perhaps a night on the town, perhaps an evening at home with a bottle of wine and a good movie.Me, I'll be hunting down Big Sexy (the best cat EVER, regardless of my husband's opinion).   He senses when I'm coming.  I'll pretend to just be coming to say hello.  He'll know.  He will hunker down, flatten his ears on the back of his head, and foam at the mouth.  First, I'll pry up an ear to apply his "anti-puking" medicine to the inside.  Next, I'll pry his mouth open and squirt a shot of the delicious chicken-flavored antibiotic in it.  He'll continue to foam and drool, so I'll hold him down until he's over it.  He'll fake being calm, I'll release him, he'll hobble off (arthritis you know) and resume drooling everywhere and most likely puke up the antibiotic within 2 minutes anyway.But the point of my review is I have spoken with several people who have gone through the ritual of trying to get their pet to swallow a pill unnecessarily.  Diamondback specializes in veterinary compounding, so a pill is not always your only option.  Now my Big Sexy is easy to pill, but wouldn't you know it, he's taking medication NOT available in one!Diamondback would have been 5 stars had they not changed locations from Thomas Rd.  Since the move, it seems like they are disorganized and it's always a fiasco when I pick up.  Hopefully, they'll get it together.  Never a problem with wrong medications or anything like that, however.~~#~0
Maybe I'm used to Thai food from LA so I would only give this place 3 stars. For lunch, it's cheap, right on a student's budget of less than $10 a meal. But, the food was just not what I was used to. I love love love green curry but the one I ordered came out looking more like gray curry. There was no hint of sweetness that I was used. A little disappointing, but I didn't complain since I was hungry.Their redeeming quality, however, was the service. Excellent, friendly staff that took the liberty to split the bill for the entire table for us. They will probably be the only reason I come back.~~#~0
This is a great place for happy hour.   I do believe these were the best chips and salsa I have ever had.  They have a bit of a kick.  Be careful though, they are definitely hard to stop eating and you will spoil your appetitie.  The fried shrimp tacos were fabulous.  I would have definitely ventured back if it wasn't for the lady bartender's bad attitude and poor customer service.  The manager  Angel was nice enough to give my co-workers and I gift cards for our next purchase there.  Not sure I would go back though.~~#~0
I had a good time here but I think that it was because of the company I was with.I was there on a Friday, right after work. The traffic on Camelback was a nightmare to get there and don't even think about parking in their lot. We parked in the residential area around the corner and walked it. Much better.The place was PACKED! We found refuge on their patio which was also the perfect place for our large party. Since its winter here, it would have been nice to have some heaters. It was BRRRRR!The service was good. Our server made sure she grabbed everyone's order and we had a HUGE group. I got drinks from the bar and the service there is a bit slow but that is expected on a busy Friday night.I also noticed a band setting up as we were leaving so I must return to check out some live music another time. I will post an update review of Rosie's when I go again. I didn't get the full experience in the short time I was there.~~#~0
This place is right across the street from the Wyndham and Hyatt hotels and the west entrance of the convention center. Decent breakfast (good breakfast burrito!), average lunch / dinner. This place is good if you are at the hotel and need a quick meal, but don't make plans to go here for a sit down dinner, you're better off going somewhere else. It is better than the place next door, called Matador. We had breakfast here twice and lunch once, out of convenience because of our conference at the convention center.~~#~0
We used to really like this place, but lately they keep disappointing us.  Good things:  They have all night drink specials, so if the game goes past happy hour, its not a big deal.  Lots of TVs, good atmosphere, good food, never overly busy to accomodate a group.  Their food is pretty good and drink prices are fair.  Some of the wait staff are nice.Bad things: They've changed their menu a little bit so some things aren't included in happy hour appetizers anymore- throw some chicken tenders or something in there please.  A girl can only eat so many chips.  They need to get more beers on tap- that's just weird for a sports bar.But my biggest complaint.  If I'm coming to a sports bar, it's to watch a game.  Don't take 15 minutes to get it on the TV.  And if there is a group of 5-10 people sitting in front of a TV cheering on our team, don't change my channel.  This has happened a couple times at this place.  And it's not like there aren't a million other TVs that nobody is watching- this place isn't that busy.  They need to get a more organized process for managing the TVs.  Most sports bars walk up to the TV, point at it, and ask if anyone would mind if they change it....sounds fairly simple.  And seriously, if we start screaming when you change the TV, don't fill 5 people's beers before you put my game back on.~~#~0
Chipotle imitation. The queso on he burrito was good but I did not enjoy the rice or the  beans. Lacked a certain flavor I like in burritos~~#~0
Hmm.  Given the other reviews, I guess we are the only people especially privileged to have problems with seating.  I don't dislike this place, but have found you need a lunch-time strategy to get in and out in a reasonable amount of time (e.g. drop two friends at the door while the third parks the car, one friend orders while the other is on reconnaissance to find a table).  It ends up working out in the end as I have never received my plate in my hands, but eating here is not a leisurely lunch - not by a long shot!  The food and drinks are good, but not worth the trouble of our "tag-team" effort.  The best part (reason for going) is the adjoining book store, and so frequent when looking for a particular title or needing a gift.~~#~0
On a one hour layover to Fort Lauderdale My friends and I ordered 3 steak burritos and 3 small Redbulls. The total came to be around $45! For fast food airport food, I thought that was a bit over priced. The food was prepared fast. The burritos were kinda small, and the so called steak, should have been called shredded beef.The taste of the burritos were good, and if I were in a rush to catch a plane, I would come back again.~~#~0
Didn't feel like cooking Sunday night. The assembled horde were hungry. Decided to order Italian and have it delivered from Guido's. Then, later that week, we all wanted to watch the CWS-NYY game and I had a hankering for eggplant parmigianaSunday, we ordered a margharita pizza, sausage pizza, garlic bread w melted mozzarella and marinara and cheesecake for all. The second time, we ordered eggplant parmigiana, antipasto, fried calamari w marinara, a couple of subs and cheesecake for all.Okay, for starters, I understand that any restaurant-delivered food is not gonna be as fresh as it would be in their dining room. That said, the food from Guido's was pretty good on that score. The delivered food was reasonably warm or reasonably cold depending on the item. The spaghetti accompanying the eggplant was al dente.Other than the calamari -- it was over-breaded, soft and overdone -- everyone was delighted with their dinner. Except me. But, that's what I get for ordering seafood in Arizona. The pizzas were warm, but a little light on the sausage topping. The cheesecake was especially good, a nice-sized portion, reminiscent of NY cheesecake. The filling was creamy without being too heavy. Guido's cheesecake has a very thin graham cracker crust. Be warned: there is an 18% service charge for orders delivered. If this food was served in their dining room, I'd knock them down a star. But, as for delivered pizza/italian food, this is about as good as it gets.~~#~0
The yogurt is very creamy and good but they're slacking on the toppings compared to Zoyo. But I mainly gave Orange Leaf a lower rating because the staff are not friendly. I sometimes go just because it's close and it's a little cheaper than the other froyo joints.~~#~0
This place has pizza just like they do in Queens, NY.  Original Traditional NY Pizza.  The Pizza is good if you like original NY Pizza thin crust if you are looking for something else besides Cheese pizza then this place is not for you.  Also I have never had anything delivered everything is dine in so no idea what delivery is like.  Also this place has terrible mac and cheese for children do not order it it is terrible just pasta with cheese melted on top nothing fancy actually terrible.  Also this place just got rid of their root beer so no root beer even though all the customers ask for it so the manager must not like customers much.  The wait staff is always changing and they are usually empty on Monday and Tuesday.  But they do have a full bar upstairs and a patio.  It is a little bit of NY in AZ.  enjoy the large cheese pizza dine in only;-)~~#~0
There's this love/hate thing I have with The Vig...First of all, I love the environment. They've done a great job of turning the old Wrong Number Lounge (yes, that was it's real name. You HAVE to love that.) into an uber-trendy hot spot, complete with an awesome outdoor fireplace and great drinks. It's a great, great spot to take out of towners and sit outside during our beautiful Arizona winter. BUT, it's bordering on Scottsdale/frat boy/cougar-land. Invading my beloved Arcadia. I can deal with that.It's the food that's the problem.The minced up chicken sandwich, in particular. (Not sure what else to call it.)I asked the waiter if I could get it without the these days prerequisite pears included, which in my imagination, were sliced on top of it or something. His response? "No. It's all kind of ground up together in the chicken."Ground up, indeed. The sandwich came and it was this chicken pieces, press board kind of filling. It was really dang gross and reminded me of a scene from Sweeney Todd. I'm REALLY easy-going about food and it was the worst sandwich I've ever had. I kept thinking about it later and throwing up a little bit in my mouth.Having said that, I do keep going back. Even though I'm going to die crossing 40th Street one day. Just stay away from that chicken sandwich. Weird, man.~~#~0
Fine, fine, fine. Just get it out of your system now. Yell at me and tell me I don't know what I'm talking about....Sorry but I just can't rave about this place. Yes, its crowded but the line moves; yes, they yell across the room for your order and yes its cooked open fire style. You can throw any number of things on top. I'm still sorry but unless I am sitting at Yankee Stadium with a Nathan's hot dog on a perfect June day - which is all about the experience and the location - its still just a hot dog. Its fine. Just fine. Its a hot dog. With or without stuff.~~#~0
My review is based solely on the hotel room, service, and pools.  I did not get a spa treatment.  Keep in mind that this is rated a 5-star hotel, people!Lobby - smelled super super musty....but it is a historic hotel.  Architecturally beautiful!!The rooms - just ok, average...no better than a 3 star hotel.  In fact, the bathroom had some chipped tiles.  No in room coffee machine!!  So, we skipped room service coffee because it was so expensive!The pools - salt water heaven!  Yay, no chlorine!  We loved the Marilyn pool...soo pretty!The service - just ok...pool side service was horrible!!  Every stinkin' time, I had to physically walk up to the bar area and order!!  Geez...definately NOT 5-star.But I do miss my Biltmore Cobb salad - yum!So, for me, it was definitely not 5-star quality....didn't even get free bottled water upon arrival and it was a freakin' 115 degrees!  (got free water at the Hilton Flagstaff). Hey...isn't Waldorf and Hilton the same chain???  YES!~~#~0
This place came very highly recommended.  But the food was simply average.  I think if we hadn't been expecting as much, we would have enjoyed ourselves better.  The trademark steamers were small, and several of ours had grit in them.  The rest of the seafood we had was well prepared, but merely average tasting.  The ambience, being in a mall left a lot to be desired.~~#~0
Sourdough lox bagels with onions, tomatoes and capers with European roast coffee.  We miss their fresh squeezed OJ, but "from concentrate" is not too bad.  EB is even better than Wolfgang Puck's in LAX.~~#~0
Stopped by for lunch a few weeks back.  My girlfriend and I ordered some apps for lunch to see how this place stacked up to other Vietnamese style places.  All in all not bad at all.  My only issue was the gristly meat they used.  Im a texture guy and I gotta say gristle makes me cringe.  Maybe a anomaly bad cut.~~#~0
From the outside, Modern Steak looks pretty cool.  The look is generally stark-white yet inviting.  I did not find it to be overly pretentious as other restaurants in the area sometimes are.  That said, I didn't really find it to be much of anything.  The food was fine, but not great.  There were really no standouts.  We had a filet and a pasta dish for entrees, both good.  We had a sour apple salad that was also good.  For sides, the mushrooms and the french fries were both OK.  All-in-all, the food was fine but nothing I'd tell anyone to rush over for.  The service was appropriate, albeit a little slow.  No draft beers -- I hate that.As for price, our food and tip total was $130 with a salad, two entrees, two sides, two beers and a dessert, so $65 per person.  If you order wine, it will obviously be more.  Not inappropriate given the expense to run such a place.Overall, this is my first 3-star rating because it really deserves 3-stars.  Nothing to write home about but nothing that's worth complaining about either.~~#~0
decent sit down breakfast.  average but in agrees with the price.  my mushroom and cheese omelet was just ok and the potatoes were a little salty and dry.  but everybody else's food looked great, like the skillets and pancakes!  their coffee is impressively strong and the pot stays on your table, definitely a plus and service is friendly!~~#~0
Urban Outfitters is an emo boy and girl's paradise! That Ramone's t-shirt you had your eye on is here and has a $30 price tag. The overpriced store is filled with funky threads for men and women such as band tees, message tees and skinny jeans and is usally filled with guys wearing guyliner and ASU girls with Daddy's Mastercard.In addition to clothes, purses and jewelry, the store also has overpriced home decor like bean bags and trippy bed sheets.Don't get me wrong. While I may hate on the store for the clientele it attracts, I've found a few fun finds here like Mad Libs and a LAMB bag.~~#~0
Stopped by on a Friday night with a group of friends.  Mike, the manager, was very nice and accommodating.  Our servers were very nice and helpful - which was appreciated, because I really dislike having to "flag down" a server.The wings were good.  If you're into hot & spicy wings, don't order the medium.  "Hot" is hot and then they have "atomic" which will burn your mouth and eyes before the plate hits the table.  Lots of choices, too.Right now, they have 49cent wings on Tuesday, 49cent boneless on Wednesdays and 99cent chicken tenders on Thursday.  Happy Hour prices for appetizers and drinks also very appealing.Probably not the best place for kiddos (although you could), it's actually the perfect location for a Friday night after a long week.   Lunches are good too.They also have a nice patio area, which would probably be really nice during the cooler months.  There is lots of parking available, just be careful not to park in front of the restaurant next door as they will have your vehicle towed.  (It's posted too!)~~#~0
Just go 2 Lo Lo's. Not moved by anything on the menu but the staff were super exellent. Asked 4 cheese on my eggs & grits & they threw SLICED sandwich cheese on it. Terrible.~~#~0
It isn't what we expected from when we moved in. They've shortened amenities and reduced club house hours. Be aware things change.What has gone well, we love the layout of our 3 bedroom apartment. It's just the perfect size and feels like quality materials in here. We also highly appreciate it being a gated community. Staff is friendly and on the ball. They have a fantastic club house, workout room, and conference room!I won't recommend it if you are loud, or need quiet, our neighbors seem to hear through the floor too easily.~~#~0
I hit this place with the family one Sunday on the recommendation of an Internet article, naming it one of the top 9 breakfast spots in the area. It was ok, and probably rates somewhere in the middle of that list. The decor is sort of homey and random with a dash of countrification; we were seated on the patio at our request and received good, patient, attentive service. It won't break the bank to eat here, but everything is a la carte, so don't expect any sides to come with your meal. The beverages are overpriced for the amount given (almost $3 for a 12 ounce cup of fountain lemonade? half filled with ice? O_o) but the food was decent. It's a unique place but not special, if you get my drift. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again, but f you're in Glendale and have a hankering, give it a try.~~#~0
I stopped here for lunch today. Good gyros - not real cheap, but the lunch classic gyro is quite fair. The service was good - I had my food fast. Seating is outdoor so be prepared. Today is spring day in 90s, so not bad in shade. Actual mid east music is nice touch.I read some of the other reviews, and I didn't see any issues with cold food or cleanliness.~~#~0
Fun atmosphere!  Average pizzas although the fungi pizza is the better pizza they serve.  I have come here a couple of times because I just love being greeted by the outdoor herb garden and they have a woodsy feel in their outdoor seating area.  It's definitely a cute place to go with friends and have a casual night out.  Love the PBR on tap!  Prices are also very reasonable.~~#~0
We use to come here often but have not been awhile.  Came here with couple of co-workers.  The place is under new ownership.  We order few happy hour sushi to try, not a big fan.  The wait staff was very friendly and kept checking up on us to see if we need anything.~~#~0
Decided to try this place based on the food network raves.  Ordered various items, including BBQ pizza, BBQ pork plate, portabella mushroom sandwich.  Also did the Peanut butter bananna split just to say we tried it.  Nothing really jumped out as being above average.  Pork was average, sandwich average and pizza was as well.  The pb&bananna split was not good AT ALL.  It was mostly the thick texas toast, and very greasy.  (we got it to split for dessert)  The only thing that was really better than average was the fried zuchinni.  The breading was light and flavorful and they were not at all greasy.  The parking was bad, but the atmosphere was kind of cute.  Different than any place I'd been before.  All in all, if you don't live in that part of town, I wouldn't make a special trip.~~#~0
It was 10:45 Saturday morning and I wanted coffee. I knew of a place right down the street from me and to my disappointment it was closed! WTF! Any way I went searching for a cafe. I wanted to sit down and read the new times with a cup of coffee. I actually started my journey thinking I would stop at the drip. But when i got there that place just seemed to modern for me. I was in a funky mood and just wanted a nice cup of coffee, nothing fancy. So I saw an older man waving a sign that said "Best lunch in town!" and he was kind of dancing too! And I said to myself "Yes, i think I will". So I stumbled upon MacAlpines. They had just opened and I sat right down at the counter. I had two cups of yummy diner coffee and after realizing I was hungry too, I ordered a stuffed tomato that was oh so yummy with super fresh veggies. The decor was adorable and welcoming and I loved the juke box. 25 cents gets you two plays! anyway, I'm not giving it four stars because it took some time for the staff to warm up and be friendly. I don't know if it was just because they had just opened or if it was because I was still sleeping and needed a caffeine fix badly. But I want to go again, with company, not by myself and I'll rate it again.~~#~0
Decided to stop in here, after a craving for a nice pink burger set in.  I opted for the Delux Burger.  The meat was excellent, along with the bread, but the toppings were subpar.  The applewood smoked bacon was barely detectable, and there was a big glob of caramelized onions masking any flavor that would have otherwise been noticed.  It left the burger tasting a little too bland.  They should consider cutting the onions in half, and maybe adding some pesto or something in addition to the aragula to give it a little contrast.I particularly appreciated the fact that they had Sonoran Root Beer on tap.  In a more negative vein, the food took forever, and the price for a burger, fries, and root beer was almost $20.  Definitely not a good value.It's worth stopping by if you're in the area and you want a burger, but you don't need to go out of your way for this.  It's somewhat overhyped.~~#~0
Typical multiplex. Had to exit the theatre to find someone to remind them that they needed to turn the overhead fluorescent lights off. Watching a movie in stark white light is not nice.~~#~0
Phoenix - do you ever turn on the air conditioning in your airport? *Sarcasm* There's nothing I love more than getting off a cramped, hot US Airlines flight with a pounding sinus headache and walking into a heatwave. *End Sarcasm*Seriously, it's old, it's dark in there (are they saving energy?), it smells like cigarette smoke, and it's hot & sweaty. And at 9:30 PM, just about everything in my terminal was closed. No food for me. Thank God I was just here for a quick 30 minute layover. The only thing redeeming about this place was the FREE WIFI! Now that's something I can get behind!~~#~0
I definitely prefer this location over Old town...parking...enough said. The atmosphere seems a bit more relaxed as well.The sushi is decent and for the price you can't go wrong. If you're wanting a fun place for happy hour this is good choice. It can get a bit loud.~~#~0
Several months ago my local Safeway gave away black recycling bags with goodies as a TV promo.  I tossed the junk food & coupons but kept the bag in my car.  I use it at TJ's & Sprouts to save plastic and paper bags.  I would like to see one or more of the grocery chains repeat the give-away with no commercial logos except for the recycling emblem on Earth Day April 22.  As far as my local Safeway goes I am there at the crack of dawn most mornings for my tall drip at the inside Starbucks.  This Safeway is relatively small but fits my day to day "emergency" needs.  For my "special" needs TJ's and Sprouts  receive more than half of my grocery budget...~~#~0
Went here for spring training, the portions are HUGE! (My friend ordered an omelet). I ordered a traditional benedict. The hollandaise was a little liquidity and my egg was poached just a little too much (the yolk didn't spill) so I wasn't crazy about my breakfast, but it wasn't bad.~~#~0
This place flirts with friendly & snooty when it comes to the service. There's definitely room for improvement. In the 'information age' when EVERYONE can be your business critic, you might want to be nice to EVERYONE, even if they don't give you a tip. Here's a tip: BE NICE TO EVERYONE. Return business is where your income comes from, after all.I believe in supporting local businesses, but I haven't been back to this place since my last snooty service because hey, at least Starbucks apologizes for making a mistake, corrects your order at no extra cost (or attitude) & knows to be nice to their customers so that they return. First off, I like the coffee at Next and the surroundings are open. The open mic nights are fun and there's a good variety of clientele. It's very welcoming... Until you order.The barista, who had also taken my order, SNAPPED at me when I asked about my drink (since I received my warmed food already). When I finally received it, it was a size smaller than I ordered. Instead of apologizing she defended herself saying that was what she THOUGHT I'd ordered and THEN she (grudgingly) made the correct size. She wouldn't even give me the one she messed up!I WANT to like this place, but I feel little enthusiasm to recommend it. If not for the college across the street I'm sure they'd more than likely be out of business. I tip when people go above and beyond. I don't pay for someone to do the job they were hired for. If my business is only going to be 'tolerated' & I'm going to be made to wait 10 minutes for my drink with a bipolar barista snapping at me when I ask a question... hello Starbucks, goodbye Next. Bad news travels faster than good news.~~#~0
We ate there this past weekend and I the food was top notch.  The value for the dollar seems to be a bit lacking.  $10 for hummus was about 1/2 what it could/should have been.  It tasted wonderful but $10 was too steep.  The lamb shanks my wife ordered were $23 and again, great taste but quite expensive for what you got.  Apple Martini was $10 and a Stella Artois on tap was about the same.The one thing I really didn't like was the very loud music.  Seemed to 80's and kind of affected the mood.  I almost felt I was shouting over the music.  The service was good and the food was very savory.  If you are looking for something unique, this is definitely worth a consideration.~~#~0
Clean, modern, Roomy Spots-bar atmosphere.  They offer a Tepan grill or a regular Sushi bar.  Chicken can be dry depending on the Sue-Chief so I always go with the Steak & Shrimp at the Tepan grill.   For those of you who are timid when it comes to Sushi try the Lobster Tempura Roll to dissolve any reservations you ever had (its cooked).  Fun place to take out a group of people.~~#~0
like a lot of other yelpers and my most recent dining companion, i really want to like this place. really, i do. they're doing something right! sourcing locally, using organic, whole ingredients...but more often than not they just don't click.i've eaten here about five times now. twice for dinner, a couple of breakfasts and once for lunch. breakfast seems to be a slam dunk. it's pretty basic though chaotic on weekend mornings. pancakes are scrumptions. but it's true, there are an ungodly amount of flies in the place! lunch was ok. but on my most recent dinner trip, what i had was just blah. i ordered the chopped salad which could be so fantastic. hearty, leafy greens, cabbage, yulu seeds and other things make it sound like a healthy dish. but when it came out covered in a thick, creamy, tasteless ranch-style dressing, it was anything but. i could have overlooked the healthy factor if it tasted good, but the dressing was so bland there was just nothing to like about it.i'll probably keep coming back here because, like i said, i desperately want to like it. though it will likely be only for breakfast.~~#~0
- Italian Beef Sandwich (Could use some Improvement) - Maxwell Street Polish Dog (Not Approved)- French Fries (As good as they get)- Burgers ( Have yet to try, but they look like the one thing that this place does right)Chicago Style Italian Beef sandwiches don't seem to have much competition in this town. My two top restaurants for authentic Italian Beef sandwiches remain as Luke's of Chicago, and the recently opened, Chicago's Taylor Street.I gave Lobbys a shot on three seperate occasions. I met the owner and we talked for quite some time on the first visit. He is a very nice guy, and seemed to speak of his burgers as being his main focus and signature menu item.As for the Italian Beef at this locaiton, he states that he slow cooks and seasons it himself. The beef isn't bad, but it seems to be lacking the full flavor of his competitors in town. The bread is a great selection, the juice that the beef is cooked in seems rather watered down and again lacks flavor. I always order a side of this hot juice to pour over the sandwich as you would a french dip with au jus.The giardanara is another big player in the outcome of the sandwich and unfortunately he uses the standard Vienna Beef giardanara. I think that he could really improve the flavor of the sandwich with a better house made or higher quality pickled giardanara than the one that he is currently using.So for the Italian beef sandwich sandwich, I'm going to leave this as the, "I'm starving to death and closer to this location than one of the competitors", choice that I would only resort to in a pinch.The Maxwell Street Polish is an even bigger disappointment, as it's simply a processed hot dog like, precooked Polish Link as you would buy in the hot dog section at the grocery store. The other competitors that I speak of in town, use a real Polish, Italian, or Brat link as you would purchase from a butcher counter. I would never order this type of sausage from any establishment unless it were Weinerschnitzel..lolNow to the French Fries, I think that they are as good as they could possibly be. He also offers a signature sauce for them, it seems to be an aioli of some sort and is very tasty. However the fries are great with a little salt and nothing else as well.I hate to see the lack of competition with what others offer in this town. I think that he could certainly gain a great deal of respect and pull in some loyal customers who look for and appreciate an authentic Chicago Italian Beef Sandwich or Sausage that would typically be offered by an establishment of this type.Check the place out and write a fitting review, maybe your opinion will be different than mine. Cheers and much luv! :)~~#~0
I was here last night with some friends to see Twilight. I mean I had free movie passes so why not right? I remember when it was the old movie theater so the changes they made were a HUGE improvement. When you walk in, it is a little confusing because all the lines say will-call. Luckily there was no one in line so I just walked up as I wasn't sure where to go. She gave us our ticket as well as menus to look over what we may want to order while enjoying our movie. Wow what a menu it is. The funny thing is all I wanted was popcorn and I had to search high and low to find it lol. It was literally the last line on the opposite side of the menu. So we go to the theater and like others have stated it is a weird set up. Luckily for us we didn't have to be herded in like others have experienced as it was pretty empty at 5pm. We picked our seats, which were the ones that had the trays in front of us. Not the weird rolling work chairs in which it looks like you are sitting at desk. That is way weird indeed.  We got comfy and pressed our button to order some food. My friend Toni ordered the kahlua mudslide and some sweet potato fries and I ordered a diet pepsi and some popcorn. OMG the popcorn was so good. It served in a basket with  side butter. It has to be a large because I swear it was never ending. My other girlfriend even was able to nosh on it and still we didn't finish it. My friend's drink was huge and she said her sweet potato fries were pretty good. I don't like the fact that the lights under those weird desk stay on the entire time. That along with people constantly walking in front of you to drop off orders or to take them was a little annoying. But I will say that the staff was very friendly and attentive.Overall it is ok. I have not been to IPIC or Ultrastar so I have nothing to compare this too but it wasn't bad, just ok. I might give a try again after I check the others but we will see.~~#~0
I am writing this review for this past weekend. 8 girlfriends and I visited Hotel Valley Ho for the weekend to celebrate one of our friend's bachelorette weekend. The so-called negatives:To begin, we stayed in the Tower Suite, which had one king size bed but was a bit misleading when we booked. There are 8 of us, and even though we knew there would be one bed, the photos online looked as though the chaise and couch could accomodate at least 5 people. It also appears as if there is another chaise, but there was only a small chair not suitable for sleeping. The website boasts that the room accomodates 8. We made it work because we are all close and don't mind sleeping 5 to a bed, but it definitely was not ideal and misleading. The pool on Saturday, which was a main reason we booked Valley Ho, is very different than other hotel pools and not in a good way. For one, most that I have been to allow the guest to bring in their own water or beverage and snacks. We were constantly reminded that our outside drinks needed to be finished, even though over half of our group were buying drinks and appetizers from the pool service bar. I understand the liability around this, however the staff was not friendly about it whatsoever. We were told to leave the pool area even though we were polite and obeying their rule, and many of us were ordering drinks. The security staff was downright rude. Terrible customer service. Perhaps the most disturbing part of our visit to the pool was that toward the end of the day, much of our group migrated up to the room. Two of us stayed back in the spa area, and left their belongings on the same chairs our group had been sitting at all day. When the two decided to leave, they returned to our area to discover that their belongings were no longer there. Someone at the front desk alerted them that they had been put into lost and found. The pool was not closed, the server that had been serving our group all day had simply dispersed of the items. This is a ridiculous way to treat your guest. The server didn't take the time to look around the pool area to see if the girls were still there - which they were, before deciding for herself to remove the belongings. The postives:In the room, the bathroom was a perfect size and it was really nice to have the full kitchen and huge outdoor patio. The decor was also really stunning and definitely added some spunk to our weekend. Overall this is ideal for groups of friends or a couple who wants to splurge.Valet staff was excellent - espcially Mike. He accomodated our group with every need.Cafe ZuZu is great. Overall, not the worst experience ever - but we were expecting the same level of customer service that you would get at any other non-chain boutique resort and that just was not there.~~#~0
Your typical Statbucks experience just a lil pricier cause it' the airport (:~~#~0
Menu isn't very appealing, however the food is delicious.  Had the Cesar salad and soup, very good. Husband had the shrimp slider which were very good. Service is very chill, kinda a small place but VERY clean.~~#~0
Been going here for over two years for eyebrow waxes.  Have good aestheticians that know great shapes for brows.  Zarrin is the best...good conversation, skilled at what she does.~~#~0
So what I can remember of this place to be quite honest (bc this was the second stop, in which I was already a bit sloshed), the bar was alright. I mean when we got there I was expecting more of a pub by the name of the place but it was more less a sports bar. The staff was all really nice, and made a good stiff drink so no complaints there, and they had a lil area in which the ones whom thought they could dance could rock it out to say the least. The music wasn't too shabby, a variety was played and the crowd was easy on the eyes. I wouldn't mind going back.~~#~0
Oh Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, how many times have I loitered on your property while waiting for the life nectar that is Sakana? Too many times.How many times have I actually purchased your wares? Once, tonight, Japanese Cherry flavor green tea to be exact.And what did I think of your wares? It's something that I shouldn't have too hard of a time digesting and forgettable. Still a good way to waste time waiting for something better? That's for truth.~~#~0
Finally decided to check this place out for lunch. It's esentially a Chipotle set up but with sushi. You can pick a pre selected roll (ranging from $6-11) or make your own a la carte. You can get soy paper or the traditional Nori wrap. I forget the name of the roll I had, it had crab and uni. It was decent, nothing to write home about. My wife actually attempted to order a riceless roll and while they made it for her, it seemed to be a super task. Overall I give it a solid 3 stars. Not sure I'll go back, but it doesn't mean you shouldn't give it a try if you're in the area~~#~0
Cool place. Went for a friends birthday outing, and had a good time. Good bottle service prices, but place is small. Cool deal is the "voyeur" window. Watch the ladies get ready to party.  You gotta see it to understand it. Good time, pretty girls, good prices. A little of Vegas, just in Scottsdale.~~#~0
Palatte is the cutest breakfast spot!  I love the outdoor seating area, the mis-matched furniture, the menus are SO cute in their metal cases, and the bathrooms are worth a trip to see even if you don't need to use them.So, why only three stars you ask?  The food.  The menu offers exciting choices but my strawberry rhubarb French toast was  sadly just okay.  It could be a combination of the ambiance and the foods presentation but I was expecting much more flavor from my meal.  I would be interested to try something on the lunch menu as I really want to love Palatte.~~#~0
Went here a yr ago but I'm new to YELP so I'm catching up :) Waited 4 hrs, yes I heard the wait was long, but Reeeaaally? Finally sat @ 10pm after having some apps next door. By the time we sat we weren't terribly hungry but the server forced our foursome into getting 4 pizzas. We ate 2 (told you we weren't hungry) and took 2 home. Pizza was good, but Cibo is better! Was the wait worth it, ahhhh No.~~#~0
Posh is a chic, modern restaurant with a fun concept and nice service. My husband and I made a reservation for our 9th anniversary. The hostess welcomed us when she pulled up our reservation she wished us a happy anniversary, as did our server when she came to the table. We sat at a cozy 2 top at the far end of the (relatively small) dining room, just beside the end of the bartop. They offered some complimentary sparkling wine (cava) because it was our anniversary, it was nice to start off with a toast! Posh's concept is all-tasting menu, all the time and you do not know what you'll be getting, it is the Chef's choice. I LOVE TASTING MENUS! Absolutely my favorite thing - I could eat little food forever and be completely happy as I prefer lots of small bites of different interesting things over a gigantic steak/starch/vegetable plate. So, this restaurant is really made for me. In lieu of a menu, you get a sheet where you cross off any proteins you aren't interested in and let the Chef know about likes/dislikes. We started off with an amuse bouche of a sorbet with basil. It was crisp and refreshing.My first course was a play on a caprese - tomato sorbet, tomato "pate", basil leaves, a balsamic reduction, and a few shavings of cheese... this dish was okay. The presentation was beautiful and the elements tasted good, but there was way more tomato with just a few scraps of cheese and then these huge basil leaves. That said, my husband's dish, which was a seafood soup, was AMAZING! It strongly reminded us of a delicious "she-crab" soup that we had had at an upscale "low country" restaurant in Vegas (now closed, sadly) My second course was Littleneck clams with a shiso broth, eggplant, and shishito pepper. My husband had shrimp that were delicious as well. The next course was softshell crab - it was pretty simply presented (I honestly can't even remember what came with it) The legs were the best part as they were crispy! It was a bit funny because the server described the crab by saying that "HE is served with"... made me a little sad to eat the little guy :) I had braised pork cheek for the next course, which was hands down my favorite course of the meal - super savory and flavorful. My husband had fried sweetbreads, which he said were a bit overdone - he didn't get much flavor other than "fried". We had a fish course, which was okay - he had seared ahi tuna, I had a flaky white fish (cannot remember the name!!) Our meat course was interesting - hubby had the kangaroo prepared with ginger sauce - it was definitely a tougher meat, which is to be expected considering the animal. The flavor was sweet and very unique. It reminded me of elk or venison. I had the New York Strip served with a risotto. The steak was tasty but a VERY small portion 2 slices of 2" x 1/2" x 1/4" (remember, I like small portions! This was just a bit too small -when you are serving wagyu or kobe beef that are very rich with fat, it makes sense to serve a tiny portion, but with regular beef, there's not a good reason to be so skimpy!) The desserts were just okay - a dulce de leche flan and a white chocolate mousse with a raspberry gelee. They tasted well enough, but they weren't really up my ally texturally - both were very mushy and neither had anything crunchy/crispy/cookie-y with them. I ordered a mocktail at the start of the meal - a fruity pomegranate soda. It was good - very sweet, but good. However, one of my first dishes included a garlic chip, which the server had described as a sunchoke chip. I took a large bite of it, and while I don't mind garlic, it meant that I was tasting garlic for the entire rest of the meal! I had a hard time drinking the very sweet soda as it didn't combine well with the garlic flavor. Also, a warning - three of our dishes included garlic chips of some sort. Now, this last bit will sound nitpicky and weird, but it totally impacted my experience: the silverware is really BIG! This made it difficult to compose dainty bites with various elements from the dishes, and was especially weird considering how petite the food is in general. So, all that said, I did really enjoy our meal! It is a lovely restaurant and the service was great! The food was pretty good and the surprise of each course made it lots of fun. We've had tasting menus in many upscale restaurants and I feel like Posh's pricing makes it a value - a similar length menu at one of the nice restaurants in Vegas would run $100 or more.~~#~0
I don't know how anyone could argue with a happy hour that goes til 9 o'clock. The wings were amazing and it was very refreshing to have a big draft beer out on the front patio. I don't get out much during the week, but I did see that they have daily specials that include $4 kettle one drinks/shots on thursday.I only have one complaint that calls for the three star instead of a four:-the beers seemed like they could've been much colder. I feel like it's really important for glasses to be ice cold as well as the beer. The glasses weren't even chilled and the beer itself was almost room temperature. I would let this slide if they were really busy (as stocking them would be difficult) but they weren't even close to being slammed. I will definitely go back to Tavern, and I would recommend it as one stop of the Mill Ave experience...~~#~0
My company rented the place out for a little team building politcal bs awards...thing. ANYWAY, the bowling was actually really fun! Staff was very helpful as we "dumbies" tried to enter our names into a screen, they also put up bumpers (yeah, you heard me) and got those metal ramp things for the little tiny kids to roll their balls down. Everyone had a good time.By, oh....11 am we were in desperate need of energy drinks. They only had Amp behind the bar and they were 5 frickin' bucks but we were deperate. Although it was a corporate business event, it was apparent they hadn't pre-selected any music for the video screen-but that said, they had a really cool video screen! I did hear some ACDC but I heard way more of Pitbull, Lil Wayne, Ray Ray and some other randoms that I don't know. "I put ON fo my city-ON ON fo my city!" Way too much Michael Jackson in my opinion but whatever. It was cool that you could request songs. I don't know if this is all the time though. The "EXTREME" bowling was fun with the lights and glow-in-the dark neon. I felt like I was in a club-ony with a bunch of other losers that were bowling! Fun place. I won free games so I guess I am going back!~~#~0
First of all, I thought it was pretty cool that this place actually did have blue wasabi. I went in a group of 6 for happy hour...the rolls and drinks were half off. The sushi was OK, but nothing special. They are also pre-made so you can't order the rolls to fit your liking which for me is important because I dont like crab, and many rolls contain that ingredient.  The service was not very good, but to give our waitress some credit it was crowded and she seemed pretty busy.~~#~0
Tonight I spent $9.28  for a burger, shake, and fries.  The service couldn't have been better.  Really nice people there and it was fast.  The restaurant was really clean, a plus with me.  The custard kind of shake was pretty good- haven't had one of that kind for awhile.  To be honest for what I paid, the burger really wasn't anything exceptional.  This surprised me as I seem to remember them being better.  Wonder what's happened there or if it was just me.~~#~0
Burritos are alright.  I had the Carne asada burrito - it was decent.  I think Los Taquitos has better tacos though.  But it was $6.50 for a burrito... yeah that's what I said.  I hate inflation...~~#~0
I feel pretty. Oh so pretty. So pretty with my pedicured peds! - - - Beauty Rule #356: You can't go to a wedding in girly sling-backs without ensuring your feet at gorgeously taken care of. It's just all wrong if you do. Knowing this, I stopped by Q Nails last night 'round 5:30 to get my peds done. After all, I have a wedding to attend this weeked! I was immediately greeted when I walked through the door. "I was hoping to get a pedicure," I said politely. "Can you wait 5 mins? Pick out color!" I looked over to my left and saw an array of nail polish. I nodded and sat down. After about a 8-10 minute wait (waiting always feels long when you have nothing to look at. All the mags were by the pedicure chairs), I was shown to the chair in the very back of the room. Another lady - who arrived shortly after me - was shown to the seat next to me. Her feet soaked for about 10 minutes while the young man who greeted me finished up another pedicure. Ironically, this same women finished her pedi before me and left about 20 minutes before I did. Immediately I switched the chair vibration/massage on. Mmmm. Talk about exactly what I needed. My feet soaked and I looked around. 6:4 - that was the ratio I saw after a while. 6 customers: 4 workers. Not too bad, I thought. The people giving the manis and pedis were attentive and worked quickly. Lucky me, I got a woman who took her time, who massaged lotion into my calves and feet for a solid 10 minutes. I did notice that only the women employees asked their customers what kind of lotion they wanted, since each little pedi station offered 3. I went with Jasmine. I also noticed that the young man who welcomed me into the store performed one of the fasted and most bizarre pedis I've ever seen. I thought for sure he was going to scrub the skin off with the pumice stone. Even the lady working on me was giving him a quizzical look. Oh well, he wasn't my guy... until my lady and him decided to do a swap. She got up to help a new customer while he finished "perfecting" my french tips. That's okay, I guess. Over all, I liked my experience. The interior is quite bare. There's a big golden Buddha welcoming you at the reception desk. There's soft "Asian" music playing overhead, which I found to be delightful and soothing. Sure beats pop music or a TV blaring. (They had their TV off.) Some notes I took while there:*They offer ear piercing*They offer facial and body waxing*They soap their ped chairs after use, rinse and then do nothing more to sanitize (must be some strong soap, eh?)*They don't throw away their pumice scrubs*They DO make you sit at this front desk-thingy with the blue lights (I'm no expert to know what it's called) so that you're nails dry faster - both manis and pedis; i had to walk across the room barefoot, tho!*They open at 9:30 a.m. and close at 7 p.m. and only work on Sundays by appointment*They CAN NOT accept tips with credit, so bring your cash! I walked out feeling like a piece of sh*t because I didn't have any cash on me, nor did I know it was a the only way I could tip. I just assumed, like other places, I could write my tip on my receipt. WRONG. The price was reasonable. $25 for a french pedicure; $20 for a regular (i think - that's what their sign said). I think they could do a better job at sanitizing their tools. Only one girl giving a ped wore gloves. The rest used their bare hands. I'm not sure what the standard practice is, though. But I'm happy to report that my toes are now reading for the wedding!~~#~0
Green Chili Stew is intense and fantastic! If you can handle spicy foods- I would say that this is a must try! Only knock on this place is that it is tiny and not ventilated very well. There is a lot of grease trapped inside of this small restaurant, and you will smell like fry bread for the rest of the day. That being said, it is worth it!~~#~0
I'm sure this is one of the biggest Goodwill stores in town, and they must have the smallest parking lot.  I like to spread my donations around, and because this location is close to home, they get a lot of my stuff.... but I don't  drop off on a Saturday morning, and I never NEVER drop off on 50% off Saturdays.If you try to drop off on 50% off Saturdays, you will be blocked in by everyone trying to buy bags of cheap stuff.  You can't go forward to get out, you can't go backward.  Invariably, someone has dumped a couch in the night, and it is blocking people from pulling behind the building.... I'm glad they are busy collecting donations, but since they aren't around to supervise the "midnight drop-offs" of less than desirable merchandise, there is almost always a delay.~~#~0
i usually get take out from this place. I've only tried the pineapple fried rice and pad see ew (which is the large flat noodles with beef). i usually get it extra spicy 4 out of 5 on the spicy scale. when they do make it spicy for me then it's really good. i think I've ordered from this place a total of 10 times and maybe 3 of the times they didn't make it spicy at all. it was bland and i had to put my own spices in it. i was so disappointed. it's gotten better though after i called and complained that when i order it spicy i mean it and not be disappointed when i get home.~~#~0
This is not a bad little Chinese food place. It's very clean inside and the employees are friendly. The food is relatively inexpensive and satisfying, even if it's not of mind-blowing quality. It's a good place to hit up on a weeknight when you don't feel like cooking or going broke.~~#~0
This arena MIGHT be reviewed higher if Sir Charles was still playing, but I digress. My friend Cynthia and I caught the Clippers vs Suns game over the weekend.   US Airways Center seemed smaller compared to Staples Center.   The ushers I encountered were nice throughout the evening.I have TWO bones to pick with this arena:First - the beer guys walking throughout the arena did not have a sign as to how much their product was.  That's just bad business in my opinion.Two - Your "security" needs to learn how to count.  I get you have to tell people THREE times before you eject someone from their seat, but I was only TWICE.(Disclaimer:  #2 may or may not have happened to me during my visit to Phoenix)~~#~0
This is a comfortable neighborhood Italian restaurant.  All the staples are here including pasta, veal and seafood. I had the veal marsala which came with a side of fettuccine alfredo.  We also ordered a couple of bottles of reasonably priced sangiovese wine.For dessert the tiramisu was large enough that the four of us could share.The service was prompt and friendly.  Overall it was a nice experience.~~#~0
A simply wonderful museum that is unfortunately run by humans. I will leave it at this, after being forced to check our infant child's diaper bag...we then proceeded to see no less than a dozen other parents with diaper bags that were not summarily removed from them.  Petty administrators with inconsistent policies make what should have been a great time a rather annoying day. See this place for sure, but just keep in mind, they are not kid friendly.  PS: We have never had an explosion of baby formula destroy a piece of art, so not sure why we got the third degree  this day.~~#~0
Very good sushi place.  The fish is good, not overly impressive but still good!  Decent prices, on par with the rest of them.~~#~0
Chinese buffets are gross things. There's a reason they're cheap, folks. So - graded on a curve - this is one of the best. Note that I'm not saying it has great Chinese food, I'm saying by the godawful standards of cheap Chinese buffets everywhere, this is one you could actually eat at once in awhile without having your Hep A vaccination updated.The positives:- HUGE variety - biggest I've seen - including Cantonese dim sum, which is a rarity and a great surprise. Big sushi bar too (but no way I'm eating raw fish at a cheap Chinese buffet).- Good turnover of customers even outside lunch/dinner hours, so the food isn't quite so dried up and gloppy relative to other buffets.Negatives:I left my iPhone on the table one day. I caught my mistake 15 minutes later, but upon my return not a soul had seen any trace of it even though my table had been cleared. The next day I used GPS to locate it - at a home about one mile from the restaurant. I called the manager, described the neighborhood, and asked if anyone in the restaurant lived in this neightborhood? I'd hate to involve the police, etc...  Lo and behold, within an hour it was determined that the "cleaning company" had found it in the bathroom, and the "cleaners" had now brought the phone back, and the "cleaners" had been duly chastised. Right....~~#~0
Not sure if this is a sign of the times or what but I was looking forward to a killer burger and fresh cut fries. LB Only delivered on half of that promise. The burger was nicely grilled, with a great char flavor, stacked with a good amount of condiments lovingly placed on a standard bun that was just the right size, however the fries left much to be desired. A large order for sure and reasonably priced, but undercooked frozen spuds does not equal fresh cut fries. After reading the menu board boasting of fresh cut fries, and observing the cook going into the walk in freezer to grab a bag of frozen fries I was a tad disappointed as they are worlds apart. Had a sip of a chocolate shake, thick, hand spun and noticed they have a great array of flavors. Chocolate flavor was there just not very intense. My biggest issue here is advertising fresh cut fries and then using frozen, it's just not cool. I understand if they need to cut corners these days to keep the doors open but please change the menu board to reflect this.~~#~0
I've been to Haji-Baba's a couple of times now and I must say... my visits have not been met with consistency in the quality of their food.  Haji-Baba is SUPER popular as you can see by the Yelp reviews of this place.  The main reason for their popularity I think is due to their prices.  Their prices are almost ridiculously low for the portion sizes you get when compared to other Mediterranean ~ Greek type of restaurants.     I did find something I liked at Haji-Baba. I recommend you try their Gyros.  It's a really good Gyros and is one of the best in the Phoenix metro.  They don't shave their Gyros meat like at the other places.  They cut their Gyros meat off in long chunks, different sizes.  This adds another level of "delicious-ness" when compared to Gyros at other locations.  They OVER STUFF their Gyros with meat, a small amount of tomatoes, red onions and pickled wild cucumbers with some tzatziki sauce.  The pickled wild cucumbers were unexpected and a nice change from other plaecs that serve Gyros.  My Gyros needed a bit more tzatziki, but my server was slammed and forgot it, oh well.As for everything else on their menu ~ meh, I've had better.  Their dolmades, rice and kibbee all tasted old and over cooked.  The shawarma and falafels also tasted over cooked and were very dry for my liking.  Restaurant location and condition~ 2 to 3 starsService ~ 3 starsFood ~ 2 to 3 stars (except for the Gyros which are 4.5 stars)Prices ~ 5 plus starsI'm looking forward to going back for another Gyros and maybe I'll try their hummus and/or a Greek salad on my next.  Hope to see you there.~~#~0
Desert-dwelling Parrotheads and tourist-trap lovers can rejoice now that a Margaritaville outpost is open in Glendale's Westgate. My cute suburban parents have an affinity for anything remotely tourist-trappy [perhaps that's a Freudian explanation of my Yelpiness].  So I knew they'd be all over this place during their most recent visit.  After the Cardinals game we wanted to wait out the unbearable traffic jams so we indulged Pops and sauntered into this bar.  Beyond the raucous post-game crowd and the Saturday night crowds we saw the day before, we were  startled and shocked to see a stilts-walking clown (I am not fucking kidding) going table to table making balloon animal figures. Besides the dining area and elevated bar, you can choose from the outside patio and upstairs tiki dining balcony.After spotting a gigantic mound of nachos in the shape of a volcano we decided we must have that.  So we ordered up a round of margaritas on the rocks with salt and the "Volcano Nachos" and some of the Florida delicacy known as Conch Fritters.  The margaritas were surprisingly blah.  I can name a dozen places in town where you can find better margaritas - Sam's Cafe, Barrio Cafe, Los Dos, Dos Gringos to name a few. People obviously must not come here for the margs.These Volcano Nachos were bigger than my face.  I mean it was huge.  Much better tasting than what we had next door at Fox Sports Grill and definitely more memorable.  I foresee Margaritaville becoming a landmark here in Glendale. The restaurant faces out onto the Jobing.com Arena doorstep and Westgate fountain-style plaza so it's in a prime location, but having been dragged to the ones in Las Vegas and Key West - it's just doesn't have that sense of place. [wah-wah sound here]~~#~0
Well we went on opening weekend and went very late.  I was hoping for breakfast around 11pm.  Despite advertising that they were open and doing regular business, when we got there and got seated, the waiter told us that it was a limited menu.  No big deal, I get it, but lame.So we order a couple drinks, some mini hot dogs, and a burger to share.The drinks were a DISASTER.  I don't think I've ever had a worse drink.  $13 for a tiny glass of vodka and muddled fruit.  No flavor, no sugar, no nothing.  Just straight vodka and fruit.  This is the most expensive drink I've ever seen on a menu and it is worthless.  I can get a damn flaming volcano of rum that has enough booze to knock two of me out for $15 at Hulas...so explain your pricing scheme to me - please.The mini hot dog things were good.  Nothing special about them, but they were okay.The burger was giant and pretty good.  It had some massive pieces of bacon on it and was cooked really well.I am still willing to go back for breakfast one of these days but for the $40 a dropped there, I really didn't get much out of it.  The service was painfully slow and the menu was overpriced.  Welcome to Scottsdale, I guess.~~#~0
I stopped in to get a quick lunch with my friend.  We decided to get a full size turkey bacon avacado sub and split it.  Glad we did because they ended up being about 8 inches long each!  The owner(?) didn't seem to mind at all either and was very nice and friendly.  Its a great combination and I thought the bacon was kind've crunchy but very tasteful.  Its not one of those very thin microwavable kind.  However, I thought it was very hard to eat.  The bread is basically sliced in half (so there's no "end wall" to eat against), and then meat, tomatoes, onion, avacado and bacon was stacked high in between.  And I mean high.  Its like the kind of sandwiches you see in a cartoon except unfortunately my mouth can't stretch out real wide like the characters usually do.  All in all it was the most difficult and messy sub I've ever eaten.  Also, I wasn't a big fan of putting a whole slice of onion on the sandwich.  I love onion, but I like it kinda split up and spread over the whole thing, not a whole slice in the middle.And I'm right there with the whole styrofoam/soup thing.  I watched as they do it and was very glad I didn't get any.I think I would come back and try something else.  Its just that I would have to eat it in private...~~#~0
Great happy hour food, good atmosphere and if you get the bug to play the ponies, just mosey on over.  I was disappointed that since my last visit they got rid of two of my favorite beers~~#~0
I was pleasantly surprised that this Elephant Bar was so much better than another one I had been to recently in Santa Clara.  It just goes to show that service can make the difference every time.  Very nice restaurant, and was a great lunch meeting place.   I'm going to be back and this time bring my favorite dining buddy - my wife.  : )~~#~0
Location: Parking sucks. Don't even bother pulling into their lot because it's valet for $3. You can find street parking or park across the street at the other business lots.Hostess: Super nice. Greeted us with a smile. Added our names and told us how long the wait would be without asking. Atmosphere: This place really wants to be swanky with rows of wine bottles, a bar and a lounge type area. I felt like it was too dark. I was reading my menu by candlelight and I hated it. I wanted a flashlight or something. My eyes started to hurt! Service:Our server was great and gave us suggestions, was very friendly and brought everything in a timely manner. She checked on us every so often which I appreciated.  Water was refilled by someone else without asking. Food: We only had the bruchetta and wine. The hubby picked two and I picked two for the sampler:prosciutto with figs and mascarponetomato jam and fresh sheeps milk cheese smoked salmon with pestoburrata, bacon, arugula and tomatoes1 thing you have to know about me is that I do not like sweet tasting food. For me, sweet is for dessert. Knowing that, you can probably guess I wasn't a fan of the 1st two which were the ones my hubby picked. But I ate them anyways. I liked the one with figs better than the tomato jam. The hubby really liked them both. I liked both the savory ones and am determined to make them at home. Clientele: People are way too dressed up to come here. Take that as you wish.~~#~0
We got some tasty take out from Noodles Ranch. The decor of the restaurant is cute and interesting and while we waited for our food I entertained myself with one of their free magazines. The staff is friendly and happy to give recomendations. We started out with the pot stickers and they were some of the best I have ever had. The sauce was tangy yet not over powering. Next I had a seafood curry. I have to admit that I haven't had that many currys solo I'm not sure I was into the flavors. I'm sure that it was prepared well but I just am not sure I'm a curry person. Overall a good experience!~~#~0
Five stars for the friendly morning staff woman who makes the best mocha in town. Seriously. One star for the other employees who seem to hate their job and serve your bagel with a side of resentment. I asked for a schmear, not a sneer, people.~~#~0
Some of the best thin-crust pizzas in town - especially the wise guy!Prices are very reasonable - Service is friendly and attentive, yet inconsistent.~~#~0
As I've mentioned in many of my other reviews, I'm not a big salad person. I almost always choose a sandwich, soup or entree over a salad, even for lunch. Given that, I always appreciate a salad that has some substance to it--if there are hearty ingredients paired with the lettuce and/or there are generous portions of these mix-ins, I'm likely to be a fan (even if I'd still order a sandwich nine times out of ten!). The seafood cake salad I had at Taylor's definitely met my standards for a good salad. There were a ton of greens and the seafood cakes that came on top of the salad were both flavorful and well-sized. It's a huge pet peeve of mine when the salad protein is such a small portion that you have to carefully meter out enough bites to last through the whole salad. I don't know about you, but at lunch, I want to eat not think. Agree with other reviewers that the salads at Taylor's are pricey but this is logical given their size. One thing I was really unenthusiastic about at Taylor's? The incredibly chilly and relatively unattentive service. I don't need a bubbly server who is constantly in my face or spewing out niceties, but I wouldn't mind someone who at least pretends to give a rat's ass about the job (or if they can't muster that, at least gets me what I need when I need it). If you want a big and tasty salad, check out Taylor's--but don't go expecting friendly service.~~#~0
Ever since I moved to AZ from CA, I have been looking for an Asian Market similar to what I was used to in CA and finally found it with Lee Lee. Although they don't have everything I shop for, it's close. They also have aisles dedicated to different cultures, which I think is great, and convenient. As good as it gets for Asian Markets in the desert!~~#~0
This place was alright but looks closed. I drove by Wednesday at around 11.30 and it was all locked up and the pool table was gone. Hard to compete in the shadow of Bullshooters, I would imagine.~~#~0
Three Words: Butter Buffalo Wings. Take a look at the photo I posted showing a close-up of the extra side of buffalo sauce I asked for and you'll see very thin red sauce with a heap of congealed butter slowly sinking to the bottom. it's enough to scare even Paula Deen away. I just don't understand, this isn't normal right?!In other news: I only tried the wings and beer so I really can't comment on the rest of the menu. But judging by the the cracked out method they serve wings...let's just say my hopes aren't sky high. They did, however, have a large selection of craft brews on tap and even more in bottles. So they get points for the booze, plus I love trivia and they have games three nights a week! Apparently, come for the beer and trivia but go elsewhere for the food unless you actually like a stick of butter served with each basket of wings.~~#~0
24 hour fedex and copy location. Visited for a package delivery and cost $13 to ship a book and cd. If these items weren't personalized with a message to the recipient, I would have just shipped new items from amazon and it would have been the same or cheaper. Yes, that was the cheapest 7 day shipping possible :(I can say that the items did arrive without any significant incidents or events.They are also a Kinkos copy center to make copies of stuff and purchase office supplies. If you need this stuff late night, they're open and waiting for you.~~#~0
Of course if they claim to have the best fish tacos-I had to try them. I liked the fish, nice large pieces, deep fried, not too heavy on the batter. Although I found the tacos a bit dry, and I didn't think their sauce was anything special-but at least they had sauce! I asked for just the tacos and they charged me and gave me the entire meal, therefore only three stars...and my search for awesome fish tacos continues.~~#~0
I'll start this by saying I have been here on 4 separate occasions and every time I just get tacos.  No frills, no beans, rice, chips, etc.  I see those as pretty much just filler and I'd rather not.  So this is about their tacos... that being said I'd like to try their breakfast burrito sometime since its received such good reviews. I have tried their carne asada, pollo, and fish tacos.  So far, my favorites are the steak and fish.  They are quite good, but I wouldn't say they're amazing.  They come double wrapped in corn tortillas (which I love) and a rather large helping of meat per taco.  I usually pound tacos like its my job but 2 is plenty for me here.  To me, on of the keys to a great taco is the cilantro, so I ask for extra and they heap it on!  The meat is pretty good, but I can see how some would call it bland.  It would be great if they spiced it on the grill.  The fish tacos are beer battered, but I have a feeling they are frozen.  So whatever, its a pretty good place for lunch, but I don't really want to try anything else on the menu as it looks pretty dang cheap.  Oh, and they do have a military discount, which is always a plus for me.  So, there you have it:Good, but not great.  I've heard Don Pancho is the place to try.  Looking forward to my first taco there.  (Did I mention I love tacos?)~~#~0
While I myself enjoyed my brief stint in a hanging cage at a club in Chicago, I doubt very much the animals here are happy about it. At least I got to get liquored up. These poor fellas get Phoenix tap water. Groddy! As far as zoos go, this one rates pretty average to me. Sort of on par with LA's in Griffith Park. A lot of the paths are like navigating Central Avenue with potholes large enough to swallow a stroller. It's difficult to see most of the animals as they seem to hide. But who can blame them. They must thinking..."WTF. Why are these two legged creatures lining up to see me poop?" Strange indeed. And it is really a place for kids. Like Chuck E Cheese. And the room of balls at IKEA. And Mia Farrow's house. If I want to see something on all fours, being held against it's will, I wait for bondage night at Pat's Bunkhouse. At least then I can have a beer and not worry about the stench of feces. Oh, wait. Strike that. Have you been to Pat's Bunkhouse?~~#~0
This place is great for families with children. It's a replica of an old Midwestern town and theres actors that put on gun shows, but just remember to tell the kiddies it's only make believe lol. The food was average nothing over the top which I wasn't expecting it to be. The menu mainly consists of burgers, BBQ, steak, salad, shrimp ect. I had the salmon with veggies, it was good.  Because it was about 20 of us, we got seated in a room with a bar and a band. The kids loved it because we were the only people in the room and the singer allowed the kids to dance next to them. Everyone had a great time, it's a place though that u only go once to, and I'm glad we went.~~#~0
Scottsdale has two types of bars; the ones full of bedazzled jeans, hair gel, stilettos and bottle service...and the ones full of cheap drinks, legendary music and a diverse group from every walk of life. Mulligan's 100% falls into the second category.Walk into Mulligans with reasonable expectations. This is a bar where you can have a good time with friends without being judged or really having a care in the world. There will always be those who are blacked out, those on a bar crawl, those on a bachelor/ette party, the out of towners, the day to night drinkers and the dive bar enthusiasts. The crowd is normally friendly and always a bit out there. Mulligans has a great selection of music and loops it in with the music videos or movie clips. While it lacks a legit dance floor, chances are, someone will create a pseudo dance floor and most of the times it results in dance party USA. Did I mention a random strip pole? I don't think I've ever seen it used by anyone but a drunk bachelorette. The drinks are stiff and cheap. The bar is centrally located in Old Town and you can easily bar hop from there. True to the Old Town dive bars, the regulars stumble in through the alley entrance. The patio is relatively small but it gets the job done.All in all, you'll most likely always have a decent time here if you're looking for a drink-filled night out. Only on rare occasions will it be overly crowded and it makes for a great people watching experience.Word of warning: If you start a tab and pay with a card, they will hold $50 from your bank account for a couple of days after your visit. And this is every time you open and close a tab so let's say you pay for three drinks separately...$50 will be held from your account for each of those drinks.3.5 stars if yelp did a half star rating.~~#~0
In my search for trivia nights ,  I visited the place this Tuesday. Place wasnt too crowded, not sure its the norm. The food was decent  and service was ok. The place can be difficult to find in the complex . The trivia was fun, good variety of questions and overall ok experience. I will visit again on a trivia night but will keep it as one of the options, not the only one.~~#~0
This location so far exceeds its pint-sized half-brother up north, its hard to beleive they came from the same mother.  If going to an Old Town dance factory is an inescapable 'must', then this place isn't so bad you'll be wishfully glancing at your watch for the world to end.  The music is current-ish, but they have a case of the mash-ups, which can be thoroughly annoying.  When will DJs learn that this format sucks?Once upon a time, DM used to place cocktail glasses of complimentary loosies up on their bartop.  THAT was impressive.  F'ing smoking ban.  The only extraordinarily annoying likelyhood  is a velvet rope line, but the few times I've been there was with some swingin dicks who enjoyed greasing the bouncers.  So, this is always a possibility if it comes to that, i.e., get cool friends.  Cover is kinda expensive at 10 Deutschmarks, but still cheaper than most places in Scottsduh.~~#~0
this place only gets three stars because of the crowd.the food is good and not your average breakfast faire, but coming here on a weekend morning is not fun if you're not upper middle class or sporting head to toe matching bicycling gear with your spouse.if you're tattooed, disheveled or hung over, you'll get stares. plus the last three times i was there my food came out wrong and/or cold. bummer.~~#~0
Did anybody have their Sangria?  Yeah my first drink from Iruna's and I fell in love.  I don't drink much fruity drinks these days, but I don't mind it here.  I can dig the food -- tapas, but I can't say I'm overwhelming wow'd by this place.  I kinda had high expectations, but I guess I shouldn't have.  The food was cooked to perfection, but it just didn't make my palates want to party.  I actually enjoyed it when my food got cold --weird!  The atmosphere is probably the best Iruna's can offer -- its underground swanky chill feel seduces my senses -- whoa!  Oh behave....!  Our service was great and it's always great every time I've attended - kudos my fellow waiters and waitresses - for I once was a great waiter :) - Enjoy!~~#~0
Don't quite think it's bringing sexy back....What can't I say about this place that hasn't been said before?Food:  they have a new chef, so apparently they heard others talking badly about the food.  I actually really enjoyed the food and our server was awesome.  Ridiculously expensive?  Yes.  Good to my tum?  Definitely.  We decided to try a little of everything so in our menu was the Seared Ahi, Chopped salad with bacon dates, Tenderloin empanadas, Mozzarella and heirloom tomatoes, and sweet potato fries.Ahi was seared perfectly.  It had a slightly spicey musky sauce with it.  Very yum unless you don't like raw-ish fish.  Bacon dates are my new favorite.  Mmmm.  Empanadas were good, but you didn't really get much of a meat flavor.  Caprese was wonderfully fresh.  Sweet potato fries....god yes.Price per dish around $9 to $14.  You're looking at about $25 for an entree.  Drinks were relatively decent in price...but $12 for a glass of wine.  My favorite Reisling is $12 per bottle, for crying out loud.This place is AWESOME for people watching.  Young things with massive...melons of flesh, meat-head men trying to look cool, 50+ women trying to outdo the young things, and 50+ men ogling everyone creepily.The singers on stage were quite cheesy.  Great choice in music, but I'd much rather listen to the DJ version than a upscale karaoke.  No dude, you're NOT bringing sexy back with those aviator shades and check shirt.  And whoa...the female singer...honey, you need someone else to do your extentions.Wierd mix of dress code:  from prom date to stained t-shirts.  Ugh.$9 for a pack of cigs (I don't smoke, but I heard) and you can order a drink in the bathroom.  Wha?  So you can drink and pee all night long and never have to leave the room?Funny, funny place.  I'd probably go again mainly for the abundance of people watching.  This place doesn't get more than three mainly for the cheese factor and the prices.  At least sugar daddies abound at this place.~~#~0
fun happy hour place! good appetizer selection! great beers! funny bartenders!~~#~0
Definitely better than the R&T north of I-10.  The service is so-so but the food is delicious.  I like their fajitas.  I'm still waiting for the "perfect" Mexican food place on our side of town but this will do until then!I rated both location 3 stars.  Although the food is better here, I think their service lacks.  It's not horrible, just not very good.~~#~0
yeah, um meh.  I guess it's because I'm not really big on Teppan yaki.  It was my daughter's birthday and this is what she wanted.  There are some good things about this place and some bad.  The regular dinner menu is over-priced, even if you are paying some poor schmuck to bang his utensils around a bit.  However, you can also order off the happy-hour menu for about half the price and get the same utensil-banging show.  I've been to a few of these places (because of my daughter), so I think I'm qualified to judge the utensil-banging skills.  Our Chef this night was really somewhat mediocre in this category.  He did bang a lot, but there wasn't much more action to set him apart.  He did the usual shrimp-tail flipping thing, missed his hat twice and gave up.  Made a nice onion volcano, tall with lots of flame.  He kind of burnt the eggs for the fried rice, but covered it up quickly with the pre-cooked rice.  The girls had shrimp, the wife had scallops and they said it was nice.  There were no leftovers - which is a good sign.Back to the plus side, I was able to order off the non-teppan dinner menu and was drawn to the Kobe burger.  Out-freaking standing.  Well worth the price, served with the standard seasoned steak fries on a brioche bun with special sauce, but the burger stood tall above the rest of the ingredients.  It was cooked a perfect medium-rare, seasoned perfectly, and delivered about the same time as the volcano was erupting, so there was no awkward eating while everybody else watched me.  Beer was great, Sappporo and Kirin in the big bottles, served cold and with a frosty glass.Overall, I say A-OK and maybe that's a little unfair, the service was great, my burger was outstanding, and the family got the show they wanted.  Based on the happy-hour pricing for the meal, it wasn't too big of a hit on the wallet.  Judging from the crowd of diners there, it appeared to be popular with families and birthday parties.  The non-teppan dining room is about half the size of the bar, which seems to be the big draw here.  I can't comment on that, other than I like the beer I had.  Would I go back?  Prolly not, unless the daughter requested it.  I think she would go back :-)~~#~0
The Boyfriend raved (and apparently the restaurant itself raves) about its famous protein pancakes, so, of course, we had to go!We went around 11:30am on a Monday morning it was a long weekend) and they place was less than half full. We were seated promptly and drinks orders taken. The server was great about coming back and getting our food orders in a timely manner as well.We ordered coffee, protein pancakes, the arizona frittata, and a side of biscuits and gravy.Coffee was good. Just good ol' plain coffee, so I can't complain.The arizona frittata included mushrooms, onions, peppers, and spinach with sour cream on top and a side of salsa all a la egg. It was good, after you put generous amounts of salt and pepper on it, but The Boyfriend still thought it was a bit bland. The biscuits and gravy were good, no complaints.Now onto the important stuff: protein pancakes!The order comes as 2 extra large pancakes that have lots of blueberries and crunchy granola in every bite. I was surprised that the pancakes were so tasty, especially since it's healthy (bleh :P)! The crunchy granola gave them an extra kick because it was a different texture and I'd was rather have bits of crunch in my pancakes than mushy oatmeal-like oats. Anyway, if I ever go again, I'm just ordering the protein pancakes!BTW, the pancakes were so big, we were only able to finish one, so I brought the second one home to the Bay Area and my dad ate it within a day!~~#~0
Nice place to go for a quick sit-down lunch.  The lunch special (changes daily) is always a good deal and will be extremely filling.  For example, two enchiladas (LARGE ones), rice and beans can be $4.95 with a soda bringing you to $6 and change after tax.  Not bad if you aren't in the mood for drive through or a longer meal at Tia Rosa's.  They'll usually give you chips and salsa too while the owner/cook is at work.  Standard fare of tacos, enchiladas, burritos throwing it some fajitas and chile rellono too.   The chorizo wasn't too greasy either so thats always a plus in my book.Not bad for an extremely filling lunch break.  They've started serving beers too with a $2 Corona, Tecate, etc. Happy Hour.~~#~0
I'm updating and improving the review. According to the proprietor, the cause of my last bad experience is gone, so I decided to return with some coworkers today. I was offered a free meal, but I declined it. The service was much improved, efficient even. The food is very tasty. It is a taco experience that is quite a bit better than most Phoenix locations. A lot of their food tends to be on the spicy side, but not all. The house-made beverages (horchata and jamaica) are very good. The guac is chunky and very citrusy, which I approve of. Do not hesitate to check this place out, but be forewarned that parking can be challenging and the location is small and crowded. Nonetheless it has one-of-a-kind ambiance and outstanding Mexican food and drink.~~#~0
It seems the description that fits Macayo's is "average".  I have been here on several occasions, but only for lunch and Happy Hour, and have only eaten in the bar.  It always seems like it is a spur of the moment decision, when I am hungry or thirsty and passing by.The interior is dark, although they do have a nice patio looking over the parking lot.  The staff is friendly and efficient, and if you have a specific request, they have always provided it.That said, the food is average, not great, but not bad.  The prices are reasonable and the portions are large.  The chips are above average, and the salsa (the hot one) is delicious. That seems to be why we eat in the bar - they are very free with the chips and salsa.This is not a destination restaurant for me - but if I am thirsty or am hungry for their chips and salsa, I will stop by for a few drinks.~~#~0
I work in the South West and I feel like if you don't want to eat at chain restaurant you're only other option is Tex Mex.  Don't get me wrong I like the Mex it's the Tex that throws me.  Luckily, there are some pretty good ones and Richardson's in Phoenix is one of them.Both David and I ordered the Blue Corn Smoked Turkey Enchiladas and an order of Guacamole.  The moment the Guacamole arrived David dumped our salsa all up on it. "Trust me," he says.  He was right the guacamole salsa combo was delicious.  So too were the Blue Corn Turkey Enchiladas.  The turkey meat was moist, yummy, and had just the right amount of smoke.  We both went with the green chile and we definitely didn't regret the choice.  I'm becoming a bit of a green chile snob and Richardson's does a good job.The interior looks like a Mexican cultural museum.  The walls and booths are very organic in appearance and designed to look like a pueblo.  I though the copper table tops were a nice touch.  The service was prompt, but nothing too special.  The u shaped bar in the middle of the restaurant seems to be a bit of a hot spot for locals.  With good food and great ambiance, Richardson's will definitely be added to my go to list when in Phoenix.1 Guacamole2 Turkey Enchilada---------------------------$32~~#~0
"Overpriced and adequate" said the husband.  They didn't have the food I ordered, so I settled on the Cadillac burger with all the fixins.  But cheese is extra and wasn't melted. And by "fixins" they mean one leaf of lettuce that was dehydrated and a couple of red onion rings (tomato was missing probably due to the scare going on at the moment).  The burger itself was cooked the way I like it, but it was over-salted.  The fries were battered with a completely flavorless coating that was orange but not at all seasoned.The husbands steak was chewier than to be expected for the cut and his potatoes were undercooked.The service was incredibly slow, but the waitress was nice enough to take off the drink that we had to send back for being too sweet.2 meals, 3 drinks, 1 dessert - $76I could have gone to a much better restaurant for those prices.  I feel kinda hosed, but I shouldn't be surprised about it because it is still mall food.~~#~0
I have been eating at Macayos for years, and I have always been pretty satisfied with the overall quality of the food.  The indgredients are fresh, and the food has an appealing presentation.  The chips and salsa are some of the best out of various Mexican restaurants that we frequent.The real issue with this location is that the staff is really inconsistent.  Occasionally, we will get a competent, friendly server, but for the most part, the service leaves much to be desired.  The servers tend to give the impression that they are annoyed to be serving you.  Other than that, the restaurant is fine - we continue to return even with the spotty service.~~#~0
We just popped in here for some lunch.  It wasn't great.  We ordered hummus to start with.  The hummus was okay, but I didn't love the pita.  I prefer the pitas that are used at Pita JungleFor lunch I ordered a small caesar salad.   First, they brought out a large.  Second, it was AWFUL!  I couldn't even eat a few bites, it was that bad.  I pushed it to the side of the table.  It was really salty and it tasted of anchovies.  I know they are used in the dressing, but you never taste them really.  You could actually taste it.  It was really weird.The waiter came over and asked if I wanted the food taken away and if I didn't like it.  I thought that was nice because oftentimes waitstaff just ignore it and then clean your plate without mentioning the fact that you barely touched it.  So I liked that he actually asked if I had a problem with it.The manager came over and asked what was wrong with it.  He was really nice about it and asked if he could bring me something else to eat.  I told him I was okay since I ate the appetizer and shared some of my boyfriend's gyro (which was good!)  He then told me he would comp the salad.  I thought that was really nice of him.~~#~0
well first let me say the one guy who said the employees that work there do deserve gold stars for when you place an order greet you nicely how may i take your order,considering all the crazy people who are disrespectfull to them and the others dinning there, they have alot patience, he's right they should be given gold stars for that, tonight around 10:30pm was going to get something to eat, but decided not to and went to circle k instead, because of the homeless group hanging outside  in the parking lot, near the limegreen volkswagon didnt look safe, with that crowd~~#~0
Rand H. and I went here for lunch and the food was good and the place was nice. It was early 11:00AM so we had the place to ourselves. But I wasn't over joyed by it. If you want this kind of food it's one of the few places like it in the valley.The owner was there greeting and serving the drinks. But there were two or three empty trays. I did as Norm R. suggested and sampled everything I thought I might like and went back for full servings of what I liked. I gave it three stars.~~#~0
The chefs at Benihana are always amazing. The food was all kinds of delicious, but the customer service was lacking. We had made reservations for two tables, and when our party was seated we were taken to one table with 11 chairs with some chairs placed behind the first row.When we told the hostess that this was a special occasion and we were promised two tables when booking the reservation she was not apologetic  with a quick "OK well I'm not the one who took the reservation". Rather than offer any kind of apology or a free round of drinks or complimentary appetizer, the staff actually seemed irritated that we wanted them to correct the mistake. Saying "actually we normally seat 11 people at one table," (not possible, you couldn't have 11 oompah loompas at one table; these chairs wouldn't fit, people would have to eat with plates in their laps). We were re-seated 10 minutes later at two tables, but I wish the situation had been handled differently because I would love to give five stars. Toshi, we loved every moment of you.~~#~0
Just three stars yes, but will I go here again, absolutely. NO doubt about it.The staff is great and friendly the draft beer is COOOOOOOLD. This may be the coldest draft beer I have ever had in Arizona. The staff and the beer would merit at least three stars.The food, well its ok. The wings are good with lots of meet on them, but the flavor is nothing to write home about. The real reason it only gets three stars is the prices for the food are higher than the quality merits. But if you are looking for a place for a great cold beer and a "talented" wait staff, this is a place you will frequent often.~~#~0
Fun place, fun music, been here dozens of times and can tell you that the vibe of the crowd on any given night can really effect this place.  Ive been here on some nights when I would say its the best bar in the world, and on others I cant down my drink fast enough to get out of there.  Good to take a group of friends.~~#~0
What I really like about this place is the fresh toppings. The yogurt flavors I've had there are okay but I wish they would mix the yogurt with the toppings, or give you more toppings so when you've finished the top layer you have more goodness to come (that would be Blissful - no pun intended). This is a great location to come and enjoy a good treat while you are walking around Mill Ave, but it's kinda tucked away and if you didn't know it was there already, you may never find it. Maybe they could advertise a little better? One more thing, I went here for the first time towards the end of 2008. I went back a few months later and it was closed for some reason and going to re-open later that month...I don't know what the reasoning was or if that is a regular thing, but you may want to call to make sure they are still open before you stop by for a treat :)~~#~0
This is a pretty good place for casual Italian at reasonable prices.I had the baked ziti with meatballs.  Plenty of sauce and cheese.  Large enough serving that I was able to take half of it home.It's a nice, clean restaurant with friendly service.~~#~0
Good lahvosh, nice patio and service was wonderful. The Southern Desert Cooler is a great summertime beverage!~~#~0
lets start by saying that the quattro frommage pizza is good. They have a nice beer selection on tap, including Firestone DBA, Samuel Adams Noble Pils and Odell's 90 Schilling. Atmosphere is comfortable with friendly bartenders. They have a very nice Vodka selection as well. Would recommend Jac's for lunch or a late night bite. I hear a rumor that Jac's proprietor also owns a microbrewery. How cool is that?~~#~0
Ahh date night. What a great chance to chill out with your loved one and enjoy a nice meal. We were decently happy with the result. Coup de Tartes was a good place, not amazing, but def a good little place to escape Scottsdale's scene.The food was good but nothing that blew my mind. We had a caprese salad and brie brûlée to start. The caprese was seasoned very well with a good balsamic and tasted very fresh. Guess you really have to suck to mess that up though. I was a little let down with my Brie brûlée, just seemed like they grabbed a slice of Brie, baked it, threw some bruleed apples on top and tossed some fruit on the plate. I mean I love cheese so it was just fine, but I guess I should have asked for something more involved. We also had the summer chicken and filet. The chicken was done very well and came out very tasty with vegetables inside and a great pesto sauce on top. Excellent mashed potatoes. My filet was just ok. Nothing I've never had before and the horseradish sauce was tasty but can def throw someone off if your not into it. Personally I don't like horseradish but I still enjoyed it, so that's a good sign. The side of frites were delicous. Freshly cut potatoes with the skin left on and a drizzle of Parmesan. You can tell I'm a starch kind of a guy. Then there was the real winner, the highlight of our night, the thing that made it allllll worth it....Chocolate Caramel Tart. Damn. This was absolutely delicious. They brought it to us and by the time the waiter had their back turned, poof, it was gone. Great texture, amazing flavor, awesome crust. Simply delicious.The decor was what I expected. Cute and a solid effort to be romantic, set in what seemed like a little cottage. I've seen more romantic (ex Little Door in LA) so this was just ok. Only a few tables so it's def an intimate setting, luckily we had no one sitting next to us. It was a little warm (thermostat read 86) but I guess everyone is having trouble in this summer desert heat, and I would have chosen different music, but all in all a very nice and original set up.PS my gf yelled at me to give it 4 stars based on dessert alone. Soooo maybe 3.5 will have to do. Compromise...that's how relationships work right?!pps We were sitting under the thermostat....no I'm not crazy.~~#~0
Ah DJs... A Scottsdale bar for when youre not feeling so Scottsdale.  Wear whatever and stroll on in, you'll still be the hottest thing in there.  Located next to Mulligans (and DrinkX, as if anyone goes there) on Stetson in Old Town, DJs can be a great place to tie one on before heading down the way to more pretentious (and much more expensive) Scottsdale hangouts like Six or PCL.  Drinks are strong, and theres pool and darts and whatnot.  Definitely decent for a dive bar, if thats your thing, which mine isnt.  It does have an ATM in there if you need cover for Mulligans.~~#~0
I really do like this place! I loove the pad thai! it's really filling and yummy! I don't care for the key lime pie, it's too sour for me. I also love the pear and  baby spinach salad, that's always amazing! I've been going there for a couple of years now and is one of my favorite resturants.~~#~0
My friend David and I arrived at Oregano's around noon on a weekday. I was hoping there would be outdoor seating, as natural light is so much better than fluorescent lights for food photography! Luckily, there were open tables on the back patio, so we were showed immediately to a table protected from the sun by an umbrella. David was quite surprised by the fact that we didn't have to wait. In the past, he'd waited for anywhere from 45 minutes to over an hour to get a table. Oregano's is notoriously busy--and w/notoriously slow service.Aside from being HUGE, the menu is packed full of dishes. Surprisingly, there are no mozzarella sticks listed under the appetizers. Instead, pick from items like stuffed mushrooms and Italian guacamole, each averaging around $5-6. We passed on the appetizers, going right for the heartier stuff.David suggested we have pizza, as he'd had it in the past and really enjoyed it. We considered getting a whole pie, which is available in thin, pan, or deep-dish crusts. Specialty pizzas at Oregano's are particular inventive. Take the 'Frisco, for example ("A tomato cream sauce covers this baby, topped with spiced feta cheese, bacon, diced roma tomatoes and cheddar cheese"), or Grandma G's Rosemary Chicken Potato ("This family favorite is made with our red pepper pesto, Grandma's special roasted garlic chicken, diced roma tomatoes, gorgonzola, sliced potatoes, havarti, our four cheese blend, caramelized onions and fresh rosemary"). David also ordered a small dinner salad ($2.99) for us to share. Our waiter explained that the salad would take longer than the pizza (huh?), so he said he'd have things timed so that the salad and the pizza would arrive at the same time.After we put in our orders, I watched as other tables were served their food. A number of other diners ordered salads, each of which appeared to contain a serving of greens more suited for a giraffe.Fewer tables ordered pastas, but a couple options there looked pretty good. I'm not such a ricotta fan, but if I were, I'd be ordering the Big 'Ol Ravioli for $9.29: "A large 6" ravioli (1/4 lb) stuffed with ricotta and other Italian cheeses, slathered with our meat sauce, then baked with cheese on top." Just thinking about it makes me want to play Frisbee...If you're not hungry enough for a flying disk of stuffed pasta, go for some layers instead. Four different lasagnas, all priced at $9.29, seem like a good options for those who are willing to wait 30-45 minutes for a special dish. The chicken lasagna piques my interest, while the artichoke version combines an unusual ingredient in a very traditional dish. I wouldn't expect that sort of risk at a chain restaurant in Phoenix, of all places, but it's good to know that such options are available.In addition to the pizzas and pastas, Oregano's covers another base w/sandwiches. The sandwiches seem pretty typical of what you'd find at your local college pizzeria: meatball and Italian subs. In terms of quality, though, these sandwiches appear to be a step or two above University Pizza and Wings, the likes of which deliver to drunk coeds until 3 a.m. Oregano's subs are served on 10" rolls or focaccia. By the time I'd finished daydreaming and people watching--half an hour later--our food had arrived. The small salad was really anything but. The two of us still had leftovers, so the small salad would probably be a good side for three or so people. The fresh mixed greens contained nary a brown leaf. Topped w/tomatoes, red onion rings, and a surprisingly large portion of crumbled gorgonzola, the salad is a different take on the ho-hum house salad. I didn't fill up too much on salad, as I had pizza sitting in front of me. Each pizza turned out to be a quarter of a full pie, and each massive slice was served on a large, circular pizza tray. No matter how you eat the pizza, it's pretty darn good: the crust is very thin, but it's not crackery, and the bottom has a tad less char than I prefer; the cheese is mild, chewy, and a tad stringy; the toppings are fresh and plentiful. The amount of sauce may have been a tad much, and I also found it too sweet.If the marinara sauce doesn't satisfy your sweet tooth, the one dessert at Oregano's will. The pizza cookie is a half-pound cookie topped with three scoops of vanilla ice cream. For $4.99, this dessert is easily enough for four people.While Oregano's food is above average, the food is not worth the epic waits so common for a table at the restaurant. In a rush, Oregano's is the last place I'd want to eat. But on a leisurely night, when I don't mind waiting too long for a table or for my meal, I'll head back to Oregano's for its friendly service, reasonable prices, and above-average food.~~#~0
Not a bad option if you are starving at the PHX airport. Ordered the Chicken Lo Mein. The vegetables tasted fresh, the chicken was white meat and the service was kind.~~#~0
As of 11 Nov, 2010, this store is open.~~#~0
The movie selection is pretty good and the service is always prompt and friendly. In fact, had I not needed to visit the bathroom with my young daughter today I would have gladly given this a 4 or 5 star rating. But the bathroom was absolutely disgusting. Just completely gross and filthy.~~#~0
Okay , what am I doing at a Filiberto's? That was the question of the evening, but it was Thanksgiving Eve and I had food to make , kids to quickly feed and my home from college daughter had a friend to meet nearby. So Filibertos it is. I ordered my traditional Mexican fast food  meal a  red  bean burrito.  Whoopee ..no big deal ..nothing to taste, blandness with  a wad of shredded cheese at the bottom...didn't get sick even though I have heard stories.   Place was clean and seemed  okay  . Girls thought theirs were just okay.  No harm no foul.  But I am not going back.~~#~0
I love sitting in the bar area when I come here, the rest of the restaurant is just way too dark. I like to see my food!I've tried their patty melt, lobster enchiladas and blue corn enchiladas. The lobster ones are my fav, but it's very rich. Be prepared for lots o' cheese on your food!  Good chips and salsa and margaritas, fun place to unwind after a hard day at work.~~#~0
This was my first visit to the acclaimed Stacy's Smokehouse.  I had the spare ribs. It was pretty good. Good flavor, nice smoke ring, good tasting sauce. It was slightly over cooked though. Most people think that "fall off the bone" ribs are how it should be and they are completely wrong. The ribs I had today were falling off the bone a little too much.  Smoke flavor was subtle and not overpowering.  Neither were the spices on the meat.  For sides, I had BBQ beans and corn bread.  Both very good.  All the food was flavored properly.I shot the shit with Stacy.  He is a very friendly dude.  He was checking with the patrons making sure they were happy with the food, greeting new customers and saying "thank you" to the ones headed to the exit.  The rest of the people in the restaurant were obviously very excited to be there.  There was a lot of talk about what to get and why.  I enjoyed my first experience, but the jury is still out.  I'll have to try some other items on the menu before I decide if I'll be frequenting this place or not.~~#~0
Came here for coffee after a huge dinner. Sampled some gelato options before deciding on a fancy looking caramel macchiato. The girl behind the counter looked annoyed when I tried to sample 3-4 different flavors and asked a lot of questions regarding their espresso drinks. (They're all named with fancy titles so I has to ask, sorry!) I saw people eating pizza next to me, so I'm guessing they sell food as well. Overall it's in a good location in Old Town Scottsdale and was fairly busy at 10p at night.~~#~0
Pleasantly surprised when me and my friends found this place while visiting Phoenix from LA for the weekend. Good prices, good food, and I absolutely love the vibe there!~~#~0
Stopped in for lunch w/ my usual 'It's-Thurs-lets-do-cheap-lunch!' chicas. Oh heaven, jars of ginger, nice sized jars of ginger...already winning points and causing me to make a mental note to myself:  must bring hubbie.  He hates having to always ask for more ginger.  Now if they would do the same w/ the wasabi......Lots of nice choices.  Liked the squid salad, something different.  Not sure why the salads (cucumber, seaweed) are running more than the standard sushi plate, unless they are pricing it up on volume??  They have some fruit and dessert options going round on the belt.  They even had inari, my idea of Japanese dessert.  Overall sushi quality is average and enjoyable to snack on.  The prices make this place a 'must return' and do so often.  Friends made-to-order salmon handroll was $1?!?!?!~~#~0
If you judge T. Cook's against restaurants in general, it probably deserves 4 or 5 stars, but if you judge it against what it purports to be, three stars is more accurate.T. Cook's is a resort-style fine dining establishment.  The attentive valet parking, impressive entranceway, decor, and certainly the prices prove that.  However, it doesn't fall into the class of gourmet fine dining restaurants because the food is not imaginative and simply prepared.  Nor is it one of the currently-fashionable "modern comfortable" places.  Rather it is a throw-back to old-time formal dining, but done, unfortunately, without the class that such retro establishments must have.  Simply, it seems to cater to an older clientele, probably in accord with the people that stay at the Royal Palms resort.That said, T. Cooks has many good points.  The food is very well prepared, the wait staff is certainly knowledgeable, and the restaurant is attractive and not too noisy.  You won't have a bad experience here until the check arrives.  Of course, you expected the check because you saw their menu (maybe even online before you arrived).  But after finishing the meal, the net effect is "this was just not good enough for the price."Tip:  before you go here, you might consider buying the Preferred Restaurants of Phoenix card.  Sunday through Thursday (or early on weekends), this gives you two entrees for the price of one, saving you $30-$35, and the card costs less than twice that.  Then you have a year to try about 30 other places.~~#~0
I don't think this place ever closes. Carne asada burrito? Gooood.Carne asada torta? Baaaaad. The meat is left in gristly sheets that are impossible to eat without looking...canine. Mind you, you are supposed to eat that like a sandwich. Deconstructing it and eating just the meat is nearly impossible, it just doesn't split apart with chewing or a plastic knife.Guess who else had five of the gross kinds of health department violations. I just can't win.And yet I will be there after Saturday night's dive bar rounds.~~#~0
Cute little restaurant - dining room, bar and kitchen are in the basement.  Literally a cellar!The seafood was good quality and solid.  The mussels smelled a little weird - not sure if it was the broth it was cooked in or the accompanying sauces but something tasted and smelled very weird.  Oysters were good - but kind of expensive.  14 for 6, 1.50 if you go to the bar at happy hour.  Stuffed shrimp was not that great.  Alaskan crab legs had a great flavor infused in them.  The sides were not terrible, but not very good - think Red Lobster with much less butter and seasoning (less butter=good, less seasoning=bad).  All in all, this is a solid seafood restaurant.  The prices are kind of hefty and I wasn't thrilled with the entree portions.  Recommend just getting appetizers if that.  I will probably go back for oysters at the bar if for anything.~~#~0
Wit Wiz is where it's at.  I was surprised and pleased to find an authentic cheesesteak in Tempe.  The large size was more than enough for my wife and I to share.~~#~0
You will get fat eating here,  and you will like it,  and it will be inexpensive.~~#~0
Large museum with limited, but interesting exhibits. Just $5 admission for adults, $4 for 11-18, and kids under 11 are FREE. Ample, easy parking, but the parking lot is quite a hike from the museum entrance (and on a hill to boot, so be careful if you have a stroller or wheelchair with you). Most exhibits are upstairs. This was a concern for me as I had a 2 year old granddaughter that kept trying to rush for the steps whenever she could wiggle out of my hands (I had visions of her going head first down those stone steps). There is an elevator, but those steps are just way too inviting for kids.On the first floor they have a transportation exhibit off to one side that is VERY child-friendly. Try dressing your preschooler up in the mini-hard hat, orange vest and hand help stop sign for a terrific photo op.The gift shop is really just a few items adjacent to the reception desk in the lobby (as opposed to a separate room). There are some outdoor exhibits that need some refurbishing. Bottom line: Worth one visit and a fun way to get out of the heat, but I probably wouldn't feel a need to make multiple visits.~~#~0
The Herberger is a toss up as a facility.  Yes, it's not like the old art deco palaces like Orpheum or the Pantages in LA, but that's ok.  I like the exterior design, the atrium and the decor of the place, but they really need a larger lobby and the way the ticket booth is set-up in a cul-de sac of sorts makes getting around the cramped lobby difficult.  Add to that some kind of craft fair vendor thing and the way people were crowded over in the bar set up in a hallway (?).  Not impressed with the set up of the lobby.  Restrooms?  Small as well...not nearly the number of stalls/urinals they should have for an 800 seat theater. The inside of the theater is very faux-traditional with the balconies and such and cozy, comfortable red plush seats and even the from the farthest of seats you have a decent view.  Not sure if it was just the production I saw, but there were no curtains, so come curtain call, the audience was confused as to whether it was over.~~#~0
I had a kobe burger....it was very good and so was the bun.....$5 for fries I thought was expensive.....basically two burgers, 3 beers and two orders of fries was $70 plus tip.  I doubt I'd go again.......~~#~0
It's cool to be green! Take your books, DVDs, Cd's and yes even tapes to Bookmans to exchange or cash out. I like the idea of "recycling" things and making it affordable for someone to buy my once treasured CD. Take a browse around the store and check out all the cool one hit wonder tapes. The store is very clean and well organized making it easy to find whatever it is you're dreaming of. It's always an adventure! There's even a little cafe in the corner should you get tired of browsing and did I mention free WiFi?~~#~0
Tried the garlic bread and the Alfredo pizza with pepperoni on it. Really good! Service was nice and the food came fast to our table. :)~~#~0
Great location for a Dunkin Donuts near the airport.  Coffee was fairly decent as usual, without all of the douchebag Starbucks crowd and coffee ordering lingo (you know, where the small one is a "tall" and the medium one is "grande").  This location has only been open a couple months and is still new/clean on the inside & out, with a very well organized selection of donuts.  Friendly employee as well.~~#~0
I had to go back for more and this time ordered a lemon ginger cupcake. It was ok. Kind of tasted like carrot cake but maybe my taste buds were in a funk from the lunch at had at culinary dropout... still a yummy cupcake.~~#~0
DISCLAIMER GLENDALE ADD IS NOT CORRECT** i sent a req to Yelp to fix it so until it changes over to 2050 W. GUADALUPE RDMESA, AZ 85202just ignore the Glendale add**on to the review... they dont open till Noon on Sundays and not till1pm on weekdays i believe..which i think is a little late, they could probably get more of a crowd if they opened a little bit earlier buuttt i dont own the place so wth am I ?? Outside it can be deceiving but inside it is a very large restaurant. They have two dining areas, a bar area, and dance floors as well. Speakers all over the place also. Apparently on Fridays 10-4am it is going to be a little club atmosphere with food ?? They have brunch on Sundays with complimentary mimosas( we were the only ones in the whole place till we left so we finished damn near a whole pitcher ... don't judge us :) we ordered fried okra, mac n cheese, rice n beans a breast and waffle dish and a 3 piece thigh and waffle dish. The okra was great, the beans and rice were pretty blah and sadly the mac n cheese was just mediocre.(i am a mac n cheese whore so i think i have a hand up in that category and it just did not tantalize my taste buds). Lover got the thighs and he liked my breast more (i totally could take that sentence to a different topic but im staying on food). The waffles were pretty good.  Now i am a girl who loves Roscoe's as well as LoLo's and i might have to give Julie's another chance to see if really match up. Julies is much closer to my house and would love to have a place like this that i loved but im not in love just yet. You know if i ever fell if i change my 3 star rating.~~#~0
We read all about Lolo's on the reviews.  It's in a sketch area,  but it seems fine during the day.  We were promptly seated  and asked what we would like to drink.  I ordered the lemonade and my other the sweet tea.  The Lemonade was one of the best lemonade's I've ever had.   The Sweet tea was exactly that too sweet.For entrée's, I ordered one leg/thiegh with a waffle.  She ordered 2 drumsticks with mac and cheese.  The fried chicken was a bit on the smaller side than I'm used to.  If you're hungry, I recommend ordering 3 piece meal.  For dessert, we ordered the red velvet cake.   Overall, the fried chicken was good but we've had better in Texas and California.  The red velvet cake was delicious, very moist.  And the Lemonade was great!The service is good as my lemonade was never empty.   I'm not sure if we would come back to Lolo's but it was A - OK!~~#~0
3.5 stars I was her for a total of 3 weeks 6 years ago and I'm back again for more corporate training but it doesn't seem much has changed. I think the furniture and fixtures in these rooms are several decades old. I do appreciate that they got rid of the old style comforters and do the duvet cover idea instead. Carpet looks newer as well.Very nice staff and this place is clean.Free internet scores bonus points! YEAH! Also free breakfast and a happy hour that some may consider good enough to be dinner.~~#~0
They don't have sunomono! No cucumber salad! The miso soup was watery, where's the miso? All the rolls are tiny, and very basic. Unmemorable~~#~0
I was very excited to finally get to try Blanco in Sky Harbor. I love Blanco in Scottsdale and what could be better than getting it to go before you fly? The ambience of the 'sit down' area seemed happening. I was in my flight uniform and sitting in a bar is a simple no no. With that, I grabbed a cheese quesadilla from the walk up/to go counter. I will say maybe they are still working the kinks out of a new place, with new people, but it was slow. Getting 'to go' should not ever be slow. Nonetheless, nothing out of the ordinary as far as quesadillas go. Other than they put parmesan cheese on top of the quesadilla and I am not quite sure why? Maybe because the quesadilla was placed in a to go box that was labeled, "Sauce"?  Who knows, but that made the entire quesadilla taste overwhelmingly, parma! I did love the salsa .. and I am a salsa snob. It can make or break me on a Mexican restaurant. My friend grabbed the chicken burrito. He seemed to like it but nothing special. Hoping that they will work the kinks out and maybe add a few items to the menu other than just quesadillas and burritos. Like how about some tacos?? Nachos?? Because this airport is my base, I will keep checking back and give them some more tries when in the lower A gates.. BUT won't go out of my high A's where the Blue Burrito is. More selection and tastier.~~#~0
After having read Chris B's review and then seeing them later the next day at the Wednesday evening Phoenix Market I decided to give them a try.  Initially looking and the Cajun Steak Jamburrito, after talking to the chef I decided to just go with the Cajun Steak Jambalaya bowl ($5.99). While waiting I was given a hush puppy to sample...light and crispy just like I like 'em.  Contemplating getting an order I figured it would be too much food.  I received my bowl of savory rice mixed with some veggies like peas, corn, carrot topped with a portion of spicy steak and some slices of sausage.  It was very much comfort food.  I did have to put a generous sprinkle of hot sauce to add a touch more heat and flavor but it was a very welcome addition.  While it didn't knock my socks or wow me, it reminded me of a few things I whip up at home now and again. I left content, full and happy I tried a new food truck.~~#~0
This place is a total sports dive... that can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on who you ask. This place boasts decent bar food (I like the burgers and the suicide wings), a STOCKED build your own bloody mary bar on sundays, and some of the wierdest regulars you'll ever run into anywhere. On any given night they have CHEAP specials on 32oz drafts... can't go wrong with that!Not much really to set the place apart from any other sports bars... pool table, Golden Tee machine, TV's everywhere... Go for the experience and decide for yourself how you feel about this place!~~#~0
No Round Table Pizza in AZ!!!  I was a big fun and I still miss their pizza a lot.  Domino is okay but not enough toppings and sometimes they forget to put on 1 or 2 toppings.   I only buy on Tuesday,  buy one large pizza get one free.  It's a deal.~~#~0
Since moving to Arizona, the only good Asian restaurants I've tried are usually Thai restaurants. I always order Pad Thai, so this is the beginning of a comparison of Pad Thai in Mesa & Phoenix.I got the lunch special Pad Thai with fried tofu. It was $6.95 + tax. The portion was decent, and they gave me a good amount of tofu. There wasn't lime, and not enough bean sprouts/peanuts in my dish. I asked for lime but they only had lemon, so I used that instead. I liked that it wasn't very oily, but maybe that's why the Pad Thai wasn't as flavorful in my opinion.~~#~0
khittie has changed her tune about hanny's. khittie likes hanny's now. their drinks are yummy. they make an almost perfect cosmo. their onion strings are awesome. meow! go there.~~#~0
Let me make this review short and sweet.Food?  Good.  Get the carne asada anything.  You can see them cooking it outside on some afternoons and you have got to have it once you smell it.Service?  Awful.  Just try getting your waiter to your table once your food has been delivered.  Want the check?  Wait thirty minutes, walk around looking for ANYONE to help you.  They tell you they will send your server.  You wait another twenty minutes.  You start to estimate how much your bill is and start to count up how much cash you have on hand and the server shows up with your bill.  It is wrong.  You can't afford to waste any more precious time here, so you pay $15 too much anyway.Or maybe that's just my experience!Come for the food and, perhaps, get your check when you're done ordering just to save some time.I'm not saying to stay away.  The food is delicious.  Definitely come.  But they call it "Mexican Time" for a reason.~~#~0
*shrug*DunnoIt was niceVery strange martinisI had the snap pea martini with egg on topIt was deliciousI just thought it was kinda ... blah. DunnoIt's very, very small.  I just feel like it was an afterthought.~~#~0
Sushi was ok, Crazyfish was WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY better. Service was great, placed an order as its one of the only sushi places that has sea eel, and the waitress came back to tell us that they ran out of sea eel... Not that its very famous or something a lot of ppl eat, which was weird and it was also one of the reasons we went there. Not sure if we'll come again, maybe next time we'll call ahead to make sure they have sea eel~~#~0
Fun place to get wet in the summer heat. This park has a large wave pool but not a lot of slides. Found the slides just OK. Think they are over due for something new.~~#~0
I guess I'm spoiled - I'm from the northern California coast where sushi means fresh fish. This tastes more like frozen and thawed out fish. It was, ok. We went on a night when you can get smaller rolls for a deal, but most of their rolls are remakes of themselves. Lots of tempura stuff and spicy tuna was not at all spicy, bummer. I'll go back because it's right down the street, but I'll try completely different rolls next time.~~#~0
A very cute place where you can eat and shop! The shop had trinkets, expensive clothes, and candy. Very random.The food isn't too bad. I had the Counter Chopped salad ($6.25) with turkey, blue cheese, grapes, candied pecans, and a lemon poppy seed dressing. The salad ingredients were fresh, and I loved the candied pecans. A friend had the grilled cheese sandwich. omg.. it took like 15 minutes just to get a grilled cheese.. I have no idea why the cooks took so long!! Just place a slice of American cheese in between two breads, melt, and wham! All done! The menu doesn't have a lot of choices, but the place is crowded. Prepare yourself to fight for seats.~~#~0
This place is good times every once in awhile. There are tons of fancy new arcade games like dance dance revolution and stuff downstairs, but upstairs is where i like to hang out.first, because there's a bar up there, where they also serve food. i've never eaten it, but i'm betting it's just so-so and probably overpriced because the drinks are. but also upstairs are all the old school games like ms. pacman, asteroids, mario bros. and they're all 25 cents. it's also inside a mall and right by the movies, so it's fun to stop in when you have a few minutes to kill.~~#~0

Lots of pool tables, friendly waitresses, good long islands and they have Guiness on tap. The crowd isn't always the best because of it's location but as long as you are there with a couple of friends it doesn't really matter.~~#~0
We would give it 3 1/2 stars if we could since Oregano's is really better then your average pizza place but it's not quite Bianco's. The Chicago Thin Crust Pizza was a very good pie. Thin but not overly hard, the ingredients were fresh but a little salty. The service was great and the place decorated really fun and retro, you definitely knew you were having a pizza when you walk in.~~#~0
This is not the same quality as the Jersey Mike's we have in san diego. The roast beef wasn't rare at all and portion was not what I am used to. Overall the sandwhich was good.~~#~0
We didn't have a really good experience here, but I don't think it was the fault of the restaurant.  A little misunderstanding with the server on "gluten free" food, but otherwise food was good, relatively competitive with others.  Atmosphere wasn't really what we liked, but that is a matter of personal opinion.~~#~0
It's 10:30am on Friday and I called to make reservations for that night and Eddie answers the phone and takes my reservation. Should I say much more than that? I mean, what restaurant owner/renowned Chef actually does that? I've been a fan of all of Eddie's restaurants, but this one has a different vibe. Not stuffy, very  comfortable and good home cooking with a culinary twist.We started with the Mo' rock shrimp appetizer which was amazing, arguable one of the best I've ever had! Huge prawns in a citrus herb sauce and it comes with "dough balls" to soak of the sauce... someone was obviously thinking! I had the Tenderloin encased on Parmesan crusted mashed potatoes, it was a lot of potatoes and little bit of meat, but the Julian vegetables surrounding the mound-o-potatoes were amazing! My boyfriend had the Chilean Seabass with lemon candied broccolini, it was light,  the plate was a bit "empty' but over taste was great! We shared the Mac and Cheese with toasted prosciutto and I'm sure this was the best part of the meal! Overall, I love the atmosphere, and I felt that the food was well priced! Try and sit near the back of the house, you get to watch all of the actions in the Top Chef meets Hell's Kitchen! Negative: our reservation was for 7:30 and we got sat at 8:10- they didn't buy our drinks at the bar while we waiting but were apologetic. If you're a fanatic about being on time, I don't think this is the place for you; I would say this is the only reason why I  gave it 3 versus stars!~~#~0
I had a nice meal and the bartender was great but I left wanting more.  Stockyards really isn't expensive compared to other big city steak houses because your steak includes a salad and starch.  I had a 12 oz NY strip(cooked perfectly), salad and a baked potato with 2 glasses of wine all for under $80.  Pretty reasonable.  The issue I have with this place is how boring it is.  There is ZERO energy.  Thursday night, Coyote's playoff game on TV and there was one dude at the bar from Alabama telling me how great  football is.  This place needs Restaurant Impossible to come in and liven the joint up.  Make it brighter, play some music and attract people under the age 65.  The 1950's are gone.~~#~0
I USE to love this place But it's cash only now...so inconvenient that if I want Bahama bucks I drive further to go to one that accepts credit/debit....~~#~0
Warning: This review is mostly based on service and lack of information, rather than food!We came here for happy hour and I was going to give this place 4 stars, but they get minus 1 for not advising us where to sit for happy hour prices... and no, I didn't think to ask "geee...what is the designated happy hour seating?" We were the first people there and they just told us to sit where ever we wanted. Also, by the time we left, there was only one other couple and they were definitely not getting the happy hour prices either.Note: Happy hour seating is ONLY at the bar and bench.The food and selection was tasty but I've had better in San Diego. I guess I need to try the other tapas joints in the area to provide a better comparison. And I do agree with others that it is a bit pricey, but some of the dishes were worth it. The red sangria was lack-luster. The lamb was good, but small for the price. The croquettes were a little bland. I think my favorite was the Patatas Bravas with was just roasted potatoes covered in a tomato sauce. It was very basic but tasty and satisfying. The bill came to approx ~$60 without tip, and when we checked the happy hour prices on some of the items we ordered, we ended up paying an extra $20 at least to sit at a table instead of the bar.~~#~0
This would have been a 4 star review, but my last visit was a mild disappointment--it seemed like the sauces were a bit runny and one dimensional.In general, everything there is pretty darned good!  the escamochas, the fish tacos, the bean burritos.... Don't be turned off by the dive building appearance.  Go get a lengua taco, they're yum!~~#~0
I had heard great things about this place and was very anxious to try it. The 1/2 chicken was good, but not the greatest, and very expensive for what you end up getting. We decided to try the dessert, a peach cobbler. Epic fail. When the server came over, I told him that it wasnt very good. He stated, oh, ok, I'll let the chef know and the dessert sat on the table for another hour while we talked. The bill came and of course the dessert was still on the bill. I just sat there amazed. I guess I won't be back. Too bad, great atmosphere and the Grind is the bomb, but this is just mediocre.~~#~0
Went for restaurant week. The lobster truffle appetizer was amazing but it definitely is the cost of a full price meal. Being from the Midwest I'm a bit of a steak snob and even though modern steak tries they use spices that definitely over power the flavor of the meat. And FYI modern steak searing is not the same thing as burning the outside my steak so it tastes burnt and charred on the outside which I had to put steak sauce on to cover up. The steak sauce not only was awful (by far the worst tasting thing I had there) it tasted like someone went wild with cinnamon and cumin and then they charged me 2 bucks for a cap full of so I could use it to cover up my burnt steak. I made a comment to the waiter he gave me the seared speech and I let it go because I was with my family. I would go back for the appetizers and drinks as they were good including the crispy shrimp and asparagus pizza however dinner wise I pass on there steak. I was impressed with the appetizers and sadly disappointed with everything else.~~#~0
This place is right down the street from the office, and I've gone here with co-workers for lunch many times over the past few months.  The place is okay, and seems to have some serious track betting going on here. Several TV's with horse racing on, machines and some betting tickets and such. I'm not much of a better myself, so I'm not even really sure how it works at this place.Anyways, I'm kind of torn between two and three stars for this place.  For starters, the inside kind of feels dated, and its always dark when we're there. Also, we usually sit in the back when we are here, since our party size is usually between 6 and 9 people at any given time.  Someone always calls ahead from the office to let them know we're coming in, so they already have the table set up in the back for us when we arrive.My problem is two fold with Armadillos. First, is that it the service always seems slow, and secondly, they don't seem to have a great lunch menu. It seems to be mostly dinner type dishes, that can be quite big and heavy for the middle of the day.  They have an insert to their menu with "daily specials" but nothing that really caters to the lunch crowd.  I mean, sometimes I want a light lunch, not a huge heavy lunch that makes me tired for the rest of the day.Also, most of the time here it seems to take forever to get our bill, and our food. I know their busy cooking it, but being that they open at 11 AM, and when we arrive we're usually the first people to be in there (aside from a few stragglers at the bar) I wish it wouldn't take so long to get our food.  Plus, we only have an hour for lunch!  One time, it took so long to get our bill, we started getting ansy and tried to hurry out of the place. We have to be back at the office by 12:30, and we didn't get our bills until 12:30!  By the time we all got our change and cards back and left, it was after 12:45, and we didn't get back to the office until 12:50.  We were 20 minutes late back from lunch!I only go here now because once in a while the ladies from work take me, and its not half bad food. I just wish they had a better lunch time menu and that the service would pick up a bit so we don't spend so much time waiting and paying for our bills.~~#~0
Decent drink specials if you happen to like frozen drinks or hurricanes. I ordered the Bourbon BBQ Bacon Burger and wasnt blown away by it. First off it, didnt come with the sweet potato fires the menu said it did and my burger was over cooked for my taste. My waitress later said if I wanted it that way, I should have asked. I guess it was my fault of reading my menu correctly...~~#~0
It's what you would expect.  A good turkey sandwich, side salad, and a cookie.  Not rocket science.  It's clean and pretty fast.  A convenient place for a quick lunch.~~#~0
Visiting my son and daughter in law for the Christmas Holiday. My wife and I arrived early Saturday morning Christmas eve day. Broncos were playing against Buffalo Bills and since it wasn't being aired at his place. Decided to go to Fox and Hound to watch the game.Haven't been to a sports bar in years, and didn't even know that Fox & Hound (F&H) was a sports bar. Anyhow, pleasantly surprised, F&H is more upscaled and accommodating then expected. Our grandson came along , 9.5 months old. a little bit of babysitting duty, The patrons and the servers were very easy going and didn't appear to mind that we brought him into F&H.  About and hour into the gaming atmosphere, our daughter in law picked up our grandson and took him home to nap, or have his own little huddle. Being Sunday football, they have various rooms with huge TVs for your viewing pleasure and separated out to various team rooms so you can watch your favorite team with fellow fans.  Our room included a good natured Buffalo Bill cheer fan who hooped and hollered every-time the Bill's out maneuvered the Broncos.  It was fun, our room enjoyed the game, even though Broncos lost. The food and drink was better then expected, Our server, Kendra did a wonderful job and made sure we had enough to drink and eat and made sure we enjoyed ourselves. we were there for about 3 hours, and never once did I feel rushed or pressured into leaving or having to constantly order something.We had: Coors and soda for drinks.Food:  Play Action Platter: Your typical chicken wings,potato skins, mozzarella sticks- including Bavarian style pretzels and of course 3 different dipping sauces with this platter.  A nice little touch is when you order this platter, a portion of the proceeds is donated to St Jude childrens research hospital.The deluxe cheese pizza with pepperoni - thin crust, crisp, marinara sauce, and enough mozzarella melted on it to create string bridges from the slice to your mouth as you bite into the slice and pull away. Ten Pack Bavarian Pretzels: Looked good and tasty with a pint of beer to help wash it down.Cobb Salad: refreshing with their cider cobb dressing.  Should have asked for more dressing. I like a lot of dressing on my salads.  This was a good way to end the food after all the fried foods and carbohydrates we ate.They also serve burgers, sandwiches and full entrees.The prices seem reasonable, there was a total of 5 adults, with only 3 adults in my party from beginning to end of game and the bill with tax and excluding tip came to about $83.  2 of the adults didn't eat or drink much and had to leave early.This is a place I can see going to time and again to enjoy sporting events, have a few drinks, food and be with like minded fans.  I will have to go to other F&H to see if it's the same atmosphere and climate~~#~0
Went here to use a local dines coupon, otherwise I don't think we would have ever gone here.Greeted by a friendly person, who sat us in a booth (first lead us to a table and I saw the taps at the booths and wanted to try that!!).  Small place with everything opened up to the patio, the weather was perfect.Very good service from our waitress, with a good explanation of the taps, happy hour, and menu.  Speaking of the menu, it is a short menu that is somewhat hard to read.  We could tell we were going to be hard pressed to spend the $30 worth of coupon we had!!  I ordered a salad (very large) and mushroom taco (very small).  It all filled me up and tasted great.  Hubby ordered chicken torte aka sandwich which was good and spicy enough.This is definitely a hip place for young folks!  We were there early but were warned they expected a huge crowd (Thanksgiving Eve) later on.  We enjoyed pouring our own beers (happy hour prices are very good!), however when the bill came, our waitress had failed to charge us for the beers!  We had to get her attention again and have her ring up the proper amount (which turned out be under $2 a beer!)  Of course using a coupon we tipped according to the full price, and we were very satisfied with the service.The biggest drawback for me was..............smoking is allowed out on the patio and the place is small, so we had to smell this during our meal and I am allergic to smoke!!  Plus the music was very loud and we couldn't converse much.  However it was a fun experience and different.  We left still feeling like we didn't get our Mexican food fix.~~#~0
This place was just ok.  Decided to stop in here with a friend before an event we were attending at the Wigwam, the sidewalk seating is quaint and inviting.  Plus they have misters, an absolute necessity this time of year in AZ.  When we stepped up to the reception desk inside, we were told to sit anywhere we liked, so we grabbed a spot outside.  The server greeted us quickly and took our drink order.  It was a little weird (and disappointing) that the Happy Hour specials were only available if they were ordered at the bar, so we had to settle for full price drinks.  And then I was told they didn't have ginger ale for my first choice mixer, so I had to rethink my order.  Not too big a deal, just slightly off-putting.  As a vegan, I was maybe relying too heavily on a few of the prior reviewers' assertions that the chips and salsa were great (I was anticipating that might likely be the only thing I could eat here).  They were okay, not anything to write home about.  There weren't any appealing vegan options to speak of, wasn't able to order a side of black beans (they only serve refried beans), so I just stuck to my chips and salsa and Long Island.  My friend's meal looked appetizing enough, but she didn't rave about it being outstanding or anything.I would give this place another try if I were in the area, just for convenience sake, and because the Old Litchfield is kind of cute and quaint, but I wouldn't go out of my way to have a meal at this cafe.  It was just alright.~~#~0
Fast friendly service.  I had a cheesteak  sandwich, fires and a soda.  The sandwich was cooked fresh and very hot.  The hogie roll was fresh with a good crust and soft inside.  The fries were hot and tasted good.  There were lots of condiments.  The most memorable was the 'fry sauce'  delicious.  The peppers were fresh and tasty.~~#~0
The only reason I went to Waffle Hizzy was to do something about my utter boredom while waiting at a nearby dealership. Plus, I wouldn't have to worry about eating afterwards. We were greeted by the Waffle House staff and immediately served coffee and water. I forgot our waitress name but she was a middle age black woman with purple hair. She was full of anecdotes and comic zest. Reminded me a bit of Wanda Sykes. There was a familiar feeling with her as she could have been a family friend that'd been over drinking and having a good time. Anywhoo, the reason I described the Wanda-like because I really wasn't coming in for the food. It was nice to have a waitress offer some humor and really take the time to just chit chat with you. She asked me if I wanted "black people's bacon or "white people's bacon?" No not offended at all. Life is too short. I ordered the black people's bacon (aka crispy) and enjoyed my coffee, bacon, grits, eggs and I think that's it. Go in and say hi and she'll put a smile on your face. Didn't think Waffle House could cost me a la cart over 13 bucks but usually when I go I'm drunk. LOL.~~#~0
Decent.  Used to be one of our regular bike night stops several years ago.  A small bribe could get you a quick table back then but HOG parking had to be at Myron's place down the street.  I still prefer Houston's for my bistecca and anything else American.~~#~0
Just ate here again last night and had the shrimp scampi pasta, which was impressive, but I did have to add salt. Something is just lacking here. Ambience and portions and quality of the food ingredients are all great, but the food just is missing some kind of splash of flavor that would make it different and/or better than I could make myself at home. The shrimp, however, were HUGE and the addition of cilantro in the dish added a nice twist.~~#~0
Great option for a person who has dietary restrictions and wants to go out with friends. It caters to basically everyone: meat eaters, veggies, vegans, and several food allergies. The food was good and I really enjoyed it, but I agree that most of the stuff I had I could have made myself. With food restrictions, you learn to cook and you learn to get creative. I had the Green Burger and it was really good, but not earth-shattering. I will continue to come back when I go out to eat with friends because it is hard to find places with good vegan options (where you KNOW that it is vegan and not cooked in butter). Love the whole-foods approach and appreciate the option. This is not important, but I kept thinking the whole time how cheesy the music was! I think I heard music from the Grease musical and Whitney Houston--What?! Lol, I chuckled the whole time I was eating as each song came on. Some better music might be nice but if you are talking with friends, who cares anyways, right?~~#~0
Glad I found this place recently. (near my gym, ha, go figure, no the two do not go hand in hand!)There are no many Chinese options in Surprise, but this appears to be the best one.  Got it as take out and the food was packed nicely in trays as opposed to the good old "chinese box"  with a few pieces of meat and 10oz of sauce in them.We had orange chicken, sesame chicken and hunan beef.  All were great.  A bit onion heavy on the beef but not to the point of ruining the dish.Only two negatives:  We got both steamed rice and fried.  The steamed white rice was very dry.   Biggest negative was the egg drop soup.  Another review said it was like dishwater, I would have to agree.  Had we eaten in the restaurant I would have definitely sent it back.~~#~0
I was really expecting more after reading all the great reviews but the food seemed very average at best. The Gnocchi was all I tried and it was passable but uninspiring. They were fairly gummy and dense and not particularly pleasing but not completely bad. The serving size was substantial though, so it could be a good place for those looking for larger portions.  The service was pretty decent and probably the highlight of my visit.~~#~0
Pretty good....but could be better....always been a fry's shopper my whole life, they always seem to have the best prices. Plus since they have gas stations now, along with fuel points and discounts, its def a must place to get groceries. Load up on points there all the time, buy gift cards there for double sometimes 4x the points, well worth it.Only complaint is their seafood selection is crap, nothing is really that fresh there at all, everything usually smells fishy(not good when looking for fresh seafood). They have never had fresh shrimp there, ever. Its always frozen, even the shrimp behind the counter is frozen. Their produce is SOOOOOO inconsistent, if u go there later in the week you can tell that they havent gotten in new stuff since last week, or they will the next day. Sometimes it takes me a good 3-4min searching thru all the bell peppers to find a good one.Don't 'always' trust their ground beef that they package there. There have been afew times they've packed soon to expire ground beef with newer ground beef on the top just to get rid of it faster. You're better off asking them to grind some fresh for you behind the counter.The little sushi counter, section they have there near the deli is actually pretty decent. Just make sure you buy it earlier in the day, or shortly after noon around 1 or 2. But if you go there late night and think about the sushi thats still there.....think again....its been there all day, and when it comes to sushi and seafood, FRESHNESS is the best ingredient!All in all this fry's gets the job done, always have had a friendly and helpful staff, great location(only 50seconds from our apartment).Usually go to AJ's or whole foods for fresh seafood, and so glad that theres a new Sprouts over on ray and 48th, can always count on them for DAILY fresh produce.But hey now a days its all about saving money, especially on gas, and fry's is the place to go for both. FUEL POINTS!!!~~#~0
Pretty much nailed on prior Yelp reviews but figured I'd add my two cents.  Atmosphere, decor, etc is very solid.  Exactly what you'd expect in this area of Scottsdale.  Food was good.  Not off the charts but solid.  Appreciated the "normal" portion sizes.  Seems many places try and impress with volume rather than quality.Service was slow.  Real slow.  Sunday morning and we were just chilling out so not a big deal.  Just know what you're getting in to.~~#~0
Black Chile Mexican Grill looks like a commercialized establishment, which was a bit of a turn off, but their food is like it's served in your family's kitchen. Let's start with the chips and salsa, which are not complementary, very similar to Chili's (a chain, ugh) however the tomatillo salsa had a good kick with a rich flavor, but at an additional cost. Ordered the chicken enchiladas which had that homemade taste with a delicious sour cream green sauce. The rice was unique and delicious to the point where it could be a meal in itself.  The beans with pork was another great homemade taste. Also ordered the beef tacos. The corn tortillas were made there and the freshness of the ingredients stood out. Went for the tres leches cake, pass on this and take the waiters recommendation. Great meal. Nice addition to the Biltmore restaurants.~~#~0
The interior is really nice and looks like what a bar should be; clean and dark with plenty of sofas and place to sit.  The music is not so memorable. It's one of the few places in town that I've been to that has my favorite beer; Belgium Lindeman's and Chimay, although in bottles. The tap is not so great, just standard.On week nights, you can always find parking but weekends could be an issue with lack of sufficient parking space. It is in a small lot. I would definitely come back here again , and see if my experience changed.~~#~0
3.5 stars... It feels too much like a chain to be 4 stars, but it's consistently good and conveniently located.  I've had sushi at 'The Fish Market' on numerous occasions and ordered from the regular menu just once or twice.  However, I will continue to go back as it's like an old standby.I've never had to wait to sit down at The Fish Market.  The service can be slow sometimes, but it's worth the wait!  I like how the menu changes daily (see the date at the top left corner each day) and the fish tastes fresh.  I recommend the sunomono salad and the octopus salad... and you can never go wrong with edamame.  If you're a scallop fan, get at least one scallop hand roll.  They don't skimp on the scallops here; I'm always pleased with portion sizes.  I recently sat in the room to the side of the bar and had dinner with a friend.  We sat by the fireplace and when we inquired about it, they made a fire for us... it added to the atmosphere that one may normally say is lacking.  Service was decent although I had to wait for water refills a few times.  If you're in the mood for sushi or seafood and not necessarily wanting a scene or really cool atmosphere, this is a good, quality old standby that you can't go wrong with... it's moderately priced and pretty consistent - hence 3.5 stars.~~#~0
So since I loved the location in Tempe, I decided to bring my car here.  They  had a banner up for basic wash special for $10.  I drove in and instantly, it was kinda awkward because it's not marked very clearly as to where you should go first.  Then when you drive into the correct area, three guys came over to take my one order...that was kinda weird too.  Then, one of the guys started telling me that they do detail work too and that I need to fix this and that on my car.  I was like, it's ok.  I just need a wash.  He rolled his eyes and said "fine."The wash was...all automated, not hand wash like the Tempe location.  Then the wiping, cleaning the interior, and the windows....it was what...like 3 min?  At the Tempe location, they literally do a detail job by spending around 15min.  Maybe I went on a wrong day? but I won't be going back. *Service = interesting/weird*Price = good $10 special*Location = ok*Work = typical AUTOMATED car wash~~#~0
I am from San Francisco on business in North Scottsdale, and I saw this restaurant on Groupon. I was able to purchase the groupon for $40 worth of food and drink for $20 and was very excited about it! When I got there at 7:30 on a Tuesday night, the place was pretty dead. There were about 5 tables filled out of 25 or so. An older couple came in and knew everyone, so were obvious "regulars", and they seemed to love the place. I ordered the White Bean Soup and the Ribeye steak with Gorgonzola sauce. The White Bean Soup was piping hot and delicious. The little bit of shredded Parmesan that melted into my spoon made the soup delectable. A waiter notified me shortly after I ordered that the ribeye was not available as the meat guy hadn't come. He substituted the porterhouse at no extra charge with the same Gorgonzola sauce that would have been on the ribeye. The steak was okay. The sauce was good, but the Gorgonzola overpowered the flavor of the steak. The steak was a little thin (hence why I'd rather have a thicker Ribeye than a thinner porterhouse). The roasted potatoes that came with the dish were delicious and the vegetables were tasty. I took 2 stars off for ambiance, not having the ribeye, and just overall satisfaction with the meal. I feel that if I had the ribeye, this might have been a 4 star.~~#~0
This is a decent Mall based movie theater.  The AMC movie theaters always seem to have a little audio bleed in from the surrounding theaters and this is no exception.  If you have a loud movie next to you, expect to hear bits of it.   The area is clean and pretty nice.  The AMC clips they have  (turn of your cell phone, no talking, etc.) are old and scratchy and didn't fit in the screen.  They need some updating.~~#~0
Haven't tried their pizza, but I do have a thing or two to say about their cannolis!Going on 10 months, I've had this insatiable craving for a cannoli. The last time I had one was in NYC 3 years ago, so I've been looking for a place that has them. Not like at an actual sit down italian restaurant where I need to buy dinner before I can have one (and there aren't many places with them on the menu), so when I found out Sal's had them, you can imagine how excited I was. Granted they're not as good as the ones in a New York or Boston italian bakery, but they came pretty close. The only downside was that the shell tasted pre-packaged, but the inside was pretty awesome - and it finally satisfied that craving!Haven't tried the pizza yet, but it looked pretty awesome.~~#~0
On Saturday night we were looking for late night bite - There was an hour wait for a table at 10pm but the atmosphere is great and we were into the music. Hanny's is definitely "the scene" kind of place, and its fun if you're in the mood for that. The place was packed so we went to the upstairs bar and there was no wait. I had a huckleberry lemonade and it was way too sweet for my taste so I switched to wine. We finally got our table and here's where the 3 stars come in - the service was not good, its the kind of place where the servers seem put out by you, and it was very. very. slow. It took 2.5 hours for dinner, which was ok, we were with a group of friends and enjoying their company but its not really a long dinner place since the music is too loud to talk. I had the Americano pizza which I shared with friends and everyone liked it. Hubby had the Porchetta sandwich and it was excellent. At the end of the meal our appetizer showed up - it didn't dawn on the runner that she was delivering an appetizer to a table full of empty plates and when I told her we didn't want it, that we were waiting for a check, she gave me an incredulous look and just stood there in silence. Our waitress seemed to think it was a big favor that they were going to take the appetizer off the check and said that the bar puts out some of the appetizers and they were backed up (nevermind the fact that we'd been at our table for 2 hours by then, that's pretty backed up).Hanny's would be a lot of fun for drinks, music and people watching, and while the food was good I don't think we'll be doing dinner again based on the service.~~#~0
Good enough for us to go back when we're feeling lazy but not good enough to rave about it.It's fast, convenient and decent.And impossible to take a piss in. Seriously. 1 stall for like, 40-70 customers. I swear every time I need to take a leak or wash my hands, someone's in there--writing a novel on the crapper or something . . .~~#~0
I play co-ed with my boyfriend and a bunch of pals here.  The facility is nice for an indoor soccer facility, with the exception of the bathrooms.  The team fee is a little pricey for an eight week round, on top of the $50 first-year membership fee ($35 to renew after that).  PLUS, like someone else mentioned, you also have to pay the refs on top of those other fees.  One thing I have to point out with this facility is that they allow teams who shouldn't be lower than a B-league to play in the co-ed recreational D-league.  This is unfair because "recreational" indicates fun, NOT competitive.  Half the people on my team come out to have fun, & have never seen a soccer ball until now, so to put them out there with people who have played for their whole life, who come out shoving & elbowing isn't a fair game at all.  The biggest complaint I have is that the refs play on the teams, so they are pretty partial to the team they play for or the people they pal around with.  Some of them are very fair, but some of them are a bit ridiculous with their calls.  Other than that, great facility; just some frustrating things going on.  My team will probably go elsewhere for at least a few rounds of soccer because of the above-mentioned things, but it's not the worst facility in the world, so if you can deal with some fairly mild obnoxiousness resulting from the politics of the place, I'd recommend it.  The turf on their fields is fantastic. : )~~#~0
Came here for dessert recently and was a little disappointed with the selection.  Yes, the place is very adorable and I always appreciate the locally grown concept.  Nonetheless, for a bakery I would have expected more options such as cakes, brownies, cupcakes, etc.  Sarah G and I shared the variety pack, consisting of five mini-desserts which we cut in half and amounted to 1-2 bites each.  The first thing I noticed was that everything was cold to the touch.  I prefer fresh out of the oven as opposed to fresh out of the refrigerator.  Still, I enjoyed the Russian tea cookie and the mini-muffin.  The "macaroon" is actually two wafer-thin 'macaroons' with 1/2 inch of frosting in between, so all you taste is frosting.  The rich double-chocolate cookie was my favorite thing in the box but would have been better if it hadn't been refrigerated.  Most people eating there were having lunch items (salads, sandwiches, etc.) that looked pretty good.  Maybe I'll go for lunch someday, although someone said the sandwiches are pre-made, which doesn't sound too appealing.~~#~0
To be fair all I ordered was oatmeal, but my dad swears they have the best pancakes around! Perfect hidden breakfast spot to try.~~#~0
I used to get really good service here and the copy machine style printers that I plugged my USB into worked so much better than trying to print from campus. But... The last few times I've come to print the printers have been so SLOW and have just not printed my papers. I'm usually in a hurry to get my paper printed and turn it in so this is pretty exasperating. I just looked at my bank account to see that the last time I was there I was indeed charged 3 times for the paper I was trying to print. I plugged into 1 printer, went through the steps, and it said printing now. Then ERROR pops up on the copy machine. I go to stand in line but it is so slow it's unbearable. I go back an try again, and the same thing happens. All the steps, then error. I finally got someone to help and do we did it on a 3 rd printer. It does the same thing but she pushes something on the copier and it works. At that point I am desperate to just get to class. But now that I know I've been charged 3 times I am done going there. It's not worth the trouble anymore. I'll just buy ink cartridges.~~#~0
The coffee and service are both good, but not great. Pastries are good, but not fresh. I go here when Lux is too busy.~~#~0
So I do love the style of this place, the booths are really cool. I always like the 50's dinner thing. I think the prices for the food here are reasonable. I ordered the eggs benidict with jalopeno hollandaise sauce $6.99. I thought it was so good I almost ordered a second round. The hash browns are freakin awsome and actually bown and crispy not greasy and mushy. My girlfriend got the fry bread dessert. I tried it and  It was very disapointing for me she only had a few bites. My standerds for frybread are high cause I have a killer recipe. We meet our friends there and one got the build it your way mac n cheese. She got tomatoes and green chillies. She shared and i thought it was good with the green chilies but I would pass on the tomato but she loved it. Her Husband got a burger. The burgers here are $10. Everywhere you go a burger is now $10. It was big and looked very tasty. The drink prices could be $1or 2 less per drink but your on mill so its expected I guess. They did have $2 bud bottels for happy our.  The reason for 3 stars and not 4 is cause the fry bread was disapointing and our waitress was good but once the food was served  she did not come back to refill my drink for a while and thats when i really needed a drink, and they were not busy at this point. All in all I liked it and will be back for sure. The waiters and waitresses all were tattooed and had really cool Sucker Punch Sallys shirts. I want one of those shirts. Its a cool dinner with a bar. Check out the pies they m,ake herefresh daily. They are huge and look great. Ill get it next time.~~#~0
I visit Delux about every 2 months.  Their beer selection, shopping cart fries, outdoor patio and bathroom decor, make this a must-visit destination for a great burger.  Occasionally, there is a long wait, poor service or even mediocre cuisine.  We are taking about a burger joint in a plaza though.  It isn't fine dining and never attempts to be so.  Plan accordingly and you will enjoy a great meal here.~~#~0
Customer service was good here and the restaurant is clean, food is average for a sushi place I would say.~~#~0
I went to this nail salon because I was in the area and because a friend of mine recommend this place to me.  When I walked in, everything she said about the place was true.  The interior is gorgeous so you feel like you are in a day spa rather than a nail salon and the place is very clean and the price reasonable for the service that you get.The only problem was that my nail color did not last.  I am not sure of the reason but my polish started to chip one or two days after I was in the salon so I was very disappointed and since I don't live close by the nail salon, I could not go back for a touch up.I was there once and have not been back since the first visit.~~#~0
My girlfriend and I ate breakfast here using an Entertainment coupon. We both had omelettes, which were fine. Our server was prompt, friendly, and cheerful. The ice tea, coffee and toast were all good. And the booths are comfortable and clean.Unfortunately, my breakfast potatoes were without question were the worst I have ever had or even laid eyes on. They literally looked like they could walk off the plate. I tried them and could not even swallow. Cold and slimy. My girlfriend got hash browns. Imagine a cold mouthful of canola oil. A couple of small menu and order discrepancies also happened. The decor is unappealing and the pre-packaged muffins on display at the bar didn't leave a good first impression. The bathrooms were what you'd expect at a bar. Overall, we still had a good time, but I absolutely will not be returning.~~#~0
I like Lux in its own quirky way.  The espresso acceptable and I enjoy the tea selection.  Keep that in mind as you continue to read.They could stand to improve their pastries, however the lattes are grand once you dilude the espresso with soymilk and the atmosphere is nice.  The loose leaf tea selection is huge for a coffee shop, they store it properly, and most are high quality.  I usually lean toward the tea or chai latte before drinking the espresso. It's not a tea shop, but it's definitely not Lipton or Starbucks.I'm actually not too fond of the interior -- I know, I'm going to get hurt saying that -- but the outdoor seating option is wonderful during our more reasonable months.  I'm not sure if the decor bothers me, or if there's just a strange vibe inside.I'm going to dodge the cups flying at my head and quietly sip my tea now.~~#~0
I worked about a mile from here, so this was a staple for us.  I'm torn-- on one hand I thoroughly enjoyed stuffing my face with reasonably priced pizza, salad and garlic knots, but I also felt tremendous guilt after eating a reheated slice of oily cheese an hour later.  I must say though, the lunch specials are quick, efficient, and wonderfully priced.  Is it as good as eating a sloppy, fresh slice of pizza in NYC?  Of course not, but it certainly will satisfy a quality, yummy pizza craving in the desert.~~#~0
Great idea for Scottsdale.  I would recommend buying tickets on line.  The theaters have comfortable airline style seats with a generous table that flips away.  Full bar menu with pub grub.  When ordering popcorn, don't pour the extra butter that comes with on popcorn.  Trust me - there is plenty or you will be scrambling for napkins after doing the backstroke in melted butter.~~#~0
Not thaaaat bad if you're in the area desperate for your Asian grocery fix. SMELL.. not the greatest, stronger than most Asian food stores, you'll get a good whiff right when you walk inLOOK'n for something? Good luck finding it! The workers barely speak English and look just as confused as you are when searching for something specific. Why are there three different places for SUGAR?!TOUCH your cash, not credit cards because they won't take if if your bill's less than $10.HEAR me out...take your little booty out to Lee Lee's on 75th and Cactus, a much better selection and organized aisles for your Asian needs...~~#~0
Drove here on a Saturday night around 8ish. It was closed. Even the parking lot was blocked off. Totally disappointed.UPDATE 4/26/08: Eyes peeled for the reopening!~~#~0
I guess I would call this tex-mex ish.. I ordered the blackened catfish tacos.. they were excellente.. They also serve some cornbread with your meal that is wonderful.. Our waiter was super nice, and cute.. I went for lunch so it wasn't crowded at all and we didn't have to wait.~~#~0
Not sure why this Dave and Buster's is classified as a Jillians Restaurant, but whatever.Work conferences can be ok, but once the workday ends, what is there to do?  I couldn't go back home, obviously, so I went searching in my rental.  Luckily, across the street from the JW Marriott there was a Dave and Busters.Ok, so I am used to the D&Bs in both Milpitas and San Diego.  I'm talking crowded, like you have yell at someone 1 foot away from you if you need to talk to them.  Crowded like if you show up after 6pm, the wait for a table at the restaurant is over an hour.  Crowded like you have to throw some elbows around to get a drink.  Oh yeah, and if you show up after 10pm, there is that silly $5 cover charge.  This is absolutely not the case at this D&B.We got there on a Wednesday, so when we checked this place out the first night, I expected it to be empty, and it was.  Fine.  We went Thrusday night, a semi-party night, but again, it was pretty much empty.  Ok.  Friday night rolls around.  This is a party night in any big city, but AGAIN, not much of a crowd.  Saturday night had a slightly higher turnout, but still pretty much an open house.Though it was a little disappointing at first, I came to realize this was a blessing in disguise.  I could walk in at any time, sit at a booth and get served right away.  If I needed credits for my card, I could walk up immediately to a machine and get it recharged.  If there were any games I wanted to play, no lines.  It truely was beautiful.After flipping through their elaborate drink menu, I settled for "The Shizzle."  Thank you Snoop Dogg for placing that suffix into everyday vocabulary.  Anyway, "The Shizzle" did taste great, so props for appropriate use of the word.The one bad memory I had was that my stuffed animal got jacked while I was playing a basketball game.  I wanted to get something for my baby, so I must have pumped at least $10 into that crane/claw game.  Each time the claw decends, grips onto the prize, but then slips out of its grasps encouraged me to keep trying.  Addicting.  After my first one was jacked, I was determined to get another.  With an amazing twist of fate, I got three in one try, so after that I called it a night.Oh yeah, and now that I think about it, I think we got ripped off because we always came at happy hour, but I think they charged us full price for drinks.  Just a tip, always ask for an itemized receipt.~~#~0
The curries are to die for especially the green and panang curries, and peanut satay dishes, The pad thai noodles are overly sweet and might as well be eaten as  dessert.I do fault the restaurant for not having satay as an appetizer! Other than that, if you want to eat well, not empty your wallet and be in and out of there, Thai Pan is a wonderful choice and the owners Mark and Watchuree and very friendly and accomodating.~~#~0
Ever go to a movie that everyone has been talking about because it is suppose to be the best ever.  I came here yesterday with really high expectations but to tell you the truth I don't have a place that serves my favorite fried chicken....or waffles for that matter.  The food was good, but I just couldn't get out of my head that it wasn't all that.  The chicken was very crispy but I wish it had more seasoning on it or something.  The waffles were pretty good but I really wasn't in the mood for that at lunch anyway.  The atmosphere was really cool, very casual and very clean, the pictures on the wall were neat and the service was great.  I don't want to downplay this place but maybe I need to come back and order something else.~~#~0
Italian Eatery? What? I thought this was just a pizza place. Oh  yeah, they do offer baked ziti and salads and lasagna, so I guess it is an eatery. I like Sbarros for two reasons. When I lived in Dallas, this was my place to stop by at the mall and watch all the ice skaters on the ice rink, fall, break their bones, noses etc. It reminds me of the good ol times when I didn't have all the worries of the world and actually had time to have a good laugh. Sigh~. The second reason I like Sbarros is because of their Mushroom Pizza! Yum. The taste is completely different than any other mushroom pizza I have ever eaten but having said, it has a nice buttery aftertaste which is what I look forward to each time I bite into that thing and it never disappoints. The pizza slices itself are pretty large for me to handle so I always ask for them to slice'em in half. I know, such a girl!The baked ziti is good too. You can order the baked ziti as a side or as an entree. Okay, so here comes the minus two stars part. The last time I went to this place, there were three servers working behind the counter. All I wanted was a slice of mushroom pizza and a little baked ziti for my little'un. Well, they wouldn't have any of it. I felt like I was seriously trying to be up sold for the entree, and then the salad, and then the large drink and then the combo. It kept going on and on from all three of the servers. I think one of them was the boss and they were seriously trying to reel me in. I really don't like that feeling and hey, all I wanted was a slice of pizza. I felt like i was at a car dealership for a second there. Will I go back here for another slice? Sure. If they try to up sell me again, probably not the next time.~~#~0
This Dos location is OK.  I mean I never have a bad time when I come here, but I never have an exceptional time.  Make the commute for the Scottsdale location.  That Dos is money!!~~#~0
Good, solid slice pizza but a bit pricey. This is my second time eating here, both times were good. Crust is very good, however the sauce was a bit bland this time. One other thing, I asked for tomatoes and they put raw, diced tomatoes on top (the kind you would expect on a taco) rolling off the edge of the pizza - bad idea. Still, this is a step up from Ray's or Barro's if you're in the mood for a slice. But I still think the best sliced pizza in the area is AJ's.~~#~0
"Good for Newbies / Whiteboys...Average to the Viets / Foodies"Noodles Ranch by name alone, should be a good indicator that they are aiming to attract the culturally timid. All joking aside, I highly doubt that a Vietnamese restaurant with a typical name like; Pho Thanh, Pho 54, Da Vang, Bin Minh, etc. would attract as many newbies or uncultured Americans, which are in great abundance in this metropolis.With that being said, this is a good place to send your mother, or someone who does not yet have a mind that is developed enough to venture to a place that caters specifically to its originating culture.I will not give this place a bad rating, as they do a great job, and make people feel welcome. They play their business model very well, and I am happy to see some Viets venture down this road and survive as long as they have in this town. They will bring you a fork and spoon as a standard protocol to keep you from feeling intimidated by chopsticks.As for the food, again, they tame things down a little bit to cater to a simplified American palette. The prices are a little higher compared to most hole in the wall Pho restaurants, but you have to consider the location and the clientele. I wouldn't go here and expect to have the best bowl of Pho in town, but would go without a high expectation now that I understand their business model and targeted demographic.Just as we might hit a lower end hamburger joint, like "Five Guys", we are fully aware of the fact that this is not an authentic hamburger, it's a modified and tamed down version to cater to a greater mass of people.Go support these guys, and don't give them a bad review if you aren't happy with their food. This is a training ground for the simple minded and unadventurous.~~#~0
I was very impressed with my last visit here.  We arrived for an early lunch on a Friday and were quickly directed to a large booth.  Chips and salsa arrived within moments.  The chips were thin, crispy and warm, there were two salsas, a mild and a hot.  The mild was cool and refreshing and the hot was not hot at all.   I guess I should qualify this as I like hot food and mild to me typically will flame my family's tongues off.  Anyway, the stuff was mild in my opinion.Service was quick, un-intrusive and impeccable.  We had a waiter and a bus-person checking us frequently to make sure we had plenty of chips, salsa and drinks.  Big props for the service, it was exceptional.  I was having lunch with some of the young ladies from the office and they were a fun, easygoing crowd that fit right into the vibe here.  The dining room is open with booths around the edges and tables in the middle, not too crowded, and plenty of room for everybody.  The ladies mostly went with the lighter enchiladas and mini-tostadas, while I went for the big guns.  The "Lunch Pollo Magnifico" was your basic Pollo Fundido.  This is a deep-fried chicken burro, covered with a Jalepeno Cream Cheese, then a layer of Cheddar is melted over it.  This dish had a great (albeit mild) chicken flavor and the cream cheese and cheddar combined to add a cheesy overtone.  It was a bit dry, but that is the nature of this dish.  The beans were ok, nothing to rave about; I don't eat rice but it looked ok.Everybody enjoyed their meal,  We also had a side of guacamole which was fresh and flavorful and as usual, I had iced tea, which also was fresh and delicious.  The tab for me with tip was somewhere around $15, which is acceptable for a sit-down meal.  This was not a meal that would challenge your tast buds, or burn your lips, but it was a decent lunch-time nosh.~~#~0
How can one not like a brewery?  They ususally have good beer, fun atmosphere, and tasty bar grub.  I guess some are better than others with some places knowing how to please their patrons better.Oggi's is located right in the middle of the Arrowhead Ranch area so location surely isn't an issue.  Right off the freeway and easy acess to the restaurant.  It's a brewery that serves its own brewed beer and pizza to a sports watching crowd as well as a family customer base.The food I've had here has been less than stellar.  Pretty much mediocre in my opinion.  Helping to satisy your hunger craving, but that's about it.  The prices are on the cheap side so it shouldn't be a suprise that you aren't coming here for the food.The beer is ok and I'm assuming the main reason why people come here.  That and all the TV's for that sports watching crowd.  Also don't expect to be super impressed with the beer.  It's good, but nowhere near the best you would expect from many other breweries.This place could also use a little updating with its decor.  With a little modernization this brewery may actually be a fun little watering hole to come to.  Ok choice for the area, but definitely not a place to go out of your way for.~~#~0
I had lunch here.The staff were super friendly.The food needs improvement.The lunch specials are 5.95 for a cup of soup, springroll, fried wontons, fried/steamed rice, and your choice of specialty dish (about 10 to choose from).Flamingo specialty chicken was not too bad. slight hint of peanuts which I like.Saucy on the outside, some pieces are kind of dry inside.House special pork (ordered extra spicy)   not spicy at all   the sauce is very soy-saucy and nothing much else.fried rice... bland.the fried wontons were soggy and thick (nothing crispy about them at all),The spring rolls were too yucky for me.I think it was the seasoning of the stuff inside.The only good part about my meal was the sweet and sour soup.I had better soup, but it wasn't too bad.~~#~0
Man did THIS PLACE hit the spot!!My husband and I were in Phoenix on a fact-finding trip (considering relocation) and part of my prerequisites is that I can find all my comfort food locally. My review could be slightly biased because I was STARVING TO DEATH...I had been sick (think vomit in the rental car) earlier that day and my husband was so freaked out that he refused to let me eat! What kinda shit is THAT? (O_o)Anyway, I was afraid to eat anything heavy and what else better to eat when you're stomach is feelin crazy but PHO? Oh how I love Yelp on my phone...so I looked up local Pho spots and this place was the closest to our hotel. It was a bit difficult to find (for us since we're not from there) and I had to call...seems we were parked on the side of the physical address...who knew the door was around the corner?The place was DEAD EMPTY - but I wasn't all that surprised...it was a Saturday afternoon and the downtown area doesn't really scream out EXCITEMENT after 5pm on Friday. I love the open kitchen idea...wish we had more places like that in LA. The service was prompt (because let's face it, they were probably happy to see some business). I ordered my usual Pho fare...rare steak and got my husband the combination of EVERYTHING. It totally hit the spot. I managed to scarf down the entire bowl. Of course, like I said...I was starving, so anything probably would've been good around that time.No complaints...except the bathroom was HELLA hard to find...~~#~0
First, let's get out of the way that my husband used to work at this Port of Subs...and he raved about how fabulous it was....so I had REALLY high expectations. Unfortunately...I was not as happy with the experience as I had hoped. While I know that subway has it's issues...they have quite the variety. Port of Subs doesn't match up...not even close. I am an extremely picky eater. They didn't have the kind of bread options that I like...although they did have the cheese and meat options I like. Their veggie selection was a bit blah, but ok.....but the condiments....what were they thinking?Seriously...is it too much to ask for a couple different kinds of mustard? They only had 1.....I'm sorry I insist on honey mustard...really I am...but is it really too much to ask?That's really the only reason I couldn't give them a higher rating...they just don't have the selection I like. The people that work their were a little snobbish too. Maybe I don't understand because I'm not from AZ....and quite frankly I hate it there. I'm an Alaska girl thank you very much. Once you hit a certain temperature...what's the point? 115 degrees in the shade? Are you mad? So what if you think it only "feels" like 98....it doesn't change the fact that it's fucking hot! Who can even eat with temperatures like that? I thought the state was going to kill me!Ok...enough of that....anyways....we're swinging back through...and I doubt we'll eat there again...but if you live in the area and hate subway (which apparently a lot of people do around there...) Port of Subs is a pretty good option. Especially if the employees are nice to you.~~#~0
I have a love/hate relationship with the Merc Bar.  I love the ambiance, I love the scotch menu, if I were single-I would love the ladies.. or I would love it as a date bar.  On the inverse side, Merc is a tad snooty.  Once, I was denied enterance purely because I was wearing a hat.  Now, this wasn't some meat-head sporty cap, nor was it a gangsta rag; no, it was simply one of those little military style caps with the short bill that you see all the hipsters wearing these days.  Comeon folks, you're in a freakin mall, LET ME WEAR MY CAP, I'M BALDING FOR GODS SAKE!!  ONLY 3 STARS FOR YOU!!!~~#~0
Let me say this before I begin: I'm not much of a sushi buff. I'll eat raw tuna until the sun comes up, but I'm not much for electric eel in zesty pepper sauces.That being said, Pure is about as nice on the eyes as a sushi spot could be. Tucked away in a suburban shopping center in north Scottsdale, it looks unassuming enough from the outside, but the inside is über clean, modern and trendy like you'd expect for the Grayhawk area. The décor is excellent -- think a winter wonderland in the desert, with white and blue hues and a stunning bar. Most people go here to see and be seen, but the food is decent as well.Get the toro, deliciously fattening tuna belly flesh with a zesty dipping sauce. Skip the non-sushi items on the menu. I got the salmon fillet and was very disappointed: dry, rubbery and salty, with not a hint of freshness.~~#~0
Guacamole was delicious!!!!' we went for happy hour and had chicken quesadillas, filet tacos, and Carlsbad brochettes! They were all delicious only down fall I found a hair  :/ kind of gross~~#~0
I've been in search of great Philly cheese steak for a while now. Unfortunately, the search continues. Steakenburger was on my list and had some pretty nice reviews. I decided to check it out recently. I ordered the regular Philly with cheese whiz and green onions and a large fry. My date ordered the steakenburger combo. We took the meal to go. The fries were still tasty and fresh when we got home. They were very large cut. Larger then I prefer, however, they had a decent flavor. Some of the fries had spots on them. I think they would have been better peeled and cut smaller but that's just me. The cheese steak was HUGE. I mean massive. Lots and lots of steak. While the bread tasted fresh it was lacking flavor. I think if they toasted the bun it would have had a much better flavor. The meat also was lagging in flavor and a little dry. It was okay. Nothing out of this world and far from gross. I tried the burger and was also disappointed. The patties were thin discs and lacked flavor, juiciness, and seasoning. While there was lots of meat the quality of the burger was very average. After some of the five star reviews I had higher expectations. Everyone has their own opinion but I feel a five star meal should be exceptional. The wife said that she would have rather had a Lennys burger and could only eat about half of it. The other comment was that if you cant finish your meal then it says something about it. I would try Steakenburger out again but at this point I don't feel I could recommend it. Unless someone was in the area and really craving a cheese steak. I feel Charlies Steakery is better than this place. I don't even think they are the greatest but for some reason they have been better than most places I've tried. And so the search continues...~~#~0
The food here is a little bland, and the service took a longer than I expected, considering there were only two other tables. Ice cream is good though.~~#~0
I know what you are thinking... why is this girl reviewing another Sports Authority?!  Well, I drive by this SA location all of the time and every now and then I pop in if I have some time to spare.  After all, I'm always in the market for a new workout outfit to motivate me to get to the gym!I recommend going to this or any SA location when in need of sports apparel, shoes, or equipment.  The selection is decent, sale racks can be great, and regular pricing is on par with most other places too...For any girls that like the color PINK or are training for one of the many walks to find a cure for breast cancer, the selection of PINK apparel is pretty good right now and they have some really cute stuff to choose from in Nike, Addidas, Puma, Champion, Under Armour, and more!Parking at this location is easy as it's a shopping center with plenty of spots to choose from.~~#~0
My wife and I went here for lunch today.  The place wasn't very crowded and the service was fast and friendly.  The food came out pretty fast as well.We both ordered a 1/2 sandwich and 1/2 salad.  The salad was pretty unique in that it came in some sort of bread bowl.  Unless you are a big bread eater than it was pretty worthless and a pain in the ass.  It was very difficult to mix in the dressing without making a mess and destroying the bread bowl.  The sandwiches are pretty good but I'm not a big fan of the bread.  They give you ginormous slices of bread and I think it is waaay to bready.The prices are pretty good and for about $10 I got a big sandwich (very big for only 1/2), a salad, chips and a drink.Think of this place as a Dilly's Deli with a bar.  Bison Witches is probably a decent drinking spot on Mill, but the food is just eh.~~#~0
Pretty darn good! Had the vegetarian combo. The falafal was super slammin'! But the hummus and baba ganoush were a little bland to me. So disappointing! Next time, I'll have what my friends had...a good old fashioned gyro! Oh, and if you dare, try the Arabic coffee. It's a jolt! One last tip, if you're going for lunch, don't go straight at noon, there's usually a long line for a table (always a good sign tho').~~#~0
Typical sports bar with the usual bar food. We really like the chicken strips and fries basket. Portions are a little smaller than the averagle sports bar (3 thin strips in an order) but there is a big serving of fries with it. The pizza was surprisingly good here. Service was a little slow on our last visit but I have a good amount of patience that it didn't bother me too much. Price is pretty on par, maybe a tad bit more, than other sports bar.~~#~0
I don't understand why anyone would ever go to Jack in the Box. Ever. Unless you're Mister Schmancy Pants High Roller. Seriously! I don't often eat fast food, but when I do, I prefer McDonalds (read in a thick Spanish accent). For a Jumbo Jack without cheese and a small Diet Coke, the total was $4.17. I could get a McDouble WITH cheese and a LARGE soda for $2.19. Half the price! The only pros to ordering Jack in the Box are that you get a sesame seed bun, a schlop of mayo, a leaf of lettuce and a slice of prematurely-picked tomato and sliced onion (as opposed to diced onion). My burger was particularly dry, had to add two packets of mustard and an extra packet of ketchup to make it chewable. On the upside, my experience with drive-thru was positive. I waited maybe 3 minutes total, from entering the drive-thru to driving away. I guess I would suggest this particular restaurant if you meet one of the following criteria:a) You have no concern for priceb) You don't have time to drive 2 miles to McDonaldsc) You have a slobbering problem and therefore don't care if the burger is dry.~~#~0
I last ate here about a month ago on a date. We were at Desert Ridge and just randomly selected it out of all of the restaurants there. The Food was fantastic, but I cannot say that the service was anything special. The place was no more than 3/4 full, but we still had to wait a a few minutes to be seated. When we were brought to the table it still needed to be cleaned. We also waited quite a while for our server to first come to our table. When we received our food, my date (who had ordered a side of mashed potatoes) was given fries and with and apology was told they were out of mashed potatoes.  Then she was asked if she wanted anything else.  I had salmon which was great. In all fairness, it was Sunday night at about 8:00, and I know that peak business hours are far from over.  But, I still expect a little more of an effort from any business.~~#~0
Went here for lunch today. The service was great and the food was decent I'm on a diet so I checked yelp for some reviews. Someone recommended the mock chicken wings. So that's what I had and my sister had the soup and salad. I thought the mock chicken was good but not as good as Green. My sister said her soup and salad were fine.~~#~0
Meh. Lots of quality food at quality prices. Great looking meat. Sushi bar underwhelming. Two droolers working. After asking for pen to fill out order, I got to sit and watch my wife return with and consume a salad while neither of the staff could be bothered to even make eye contact. They can keep their sushi as it turns out. Probably won't be back.~~#~0
***This location is closed***Received a gift card from Mcgraths after they had seen my previous review. I actually was surprised because I didnt really give them that bad a review compared to some of the others that were posted. In any event, I though it was cool that they were willing to give me a free meal. So I went to use my card at lunch one day and was disappointed to find that this location is "closed for good" as I was told by a woman who I guess was an employee? I am actually a bit disapointed because McGraths had a great soup and salad lunch. Not sure if there are other locations where I can use this gift card...~~#~0
this was our first visit to Jimmy Woo's and we were looking forward to it. the happy hour specials were a very good deal. all drinks, all apps, and all house sushi are half off. at their already very reasonable prices, the half off is a great incentive to enjoy the happy hour. maybe we didn't read the menu quite as thoroughly as we should, but all our apps turned out to be fried....panko shrimp, tempura veggies, and tempura crab. the crab dish came with only 2 crabs and the rest veggies. it was ok.i ordered one of the fish entrees and my wife the veggie delight. both were ok, but tasted like any other chinese food i've ever eaten. and i really, really like the DJ. his music was cool and down-tempo, but a little loud. is this a club or a restaurant? that's why we stopped going to RA....i don't want to yell at my wife to pass me the chopsticks at a restaurant. i would go back just because their happy hour was such a good deal.~~#~0
For the longest time I was not a big fan of this place. I like my Mexican a tad more authentic. Revo is like the Trader Joe's  of Mexican take out.  The place is modern, the tables are clean, the signage boasts of vegetarian or gluten free meals.  What it lacks for in flavor it tried to make up for in advertising. What's so special about the lemonade? Have you tried the horchata at Mesquite? Puuleeze. Then I got over myself and changed my expectations. The food is decent, the ingredients fresh and they make great fish tacos. Order them to go, get home and put some real salsa on them and you'll have a cheap and yummy meal. And let's face it, a lot less calories than your normal Mexican take out.~~#~0
We ate here twice while on a business trip from Atlanta in June. The first time, it was just a few of us. The second time, it was our entire group. As expected, they group experience was a little less pleasant. Overall, I really dug the atmosphere, but the food left a good bit of room for improvement. The food was rather drab. I had a burger the first time and a steak the latter. Both were somewhat bland. The burger was not cooked the way I ordered and the steak was somewhat tough. This being a steakhouse, I expected quite a bit more.The only thing that found itself worthy if 3 stars was the service and the atmosphere. Everyone I encountered was super friendly. The staff was more than willing to accommodate our group and I hate being the one to say it, but the food was a let down. If you are just going to have a few beers with friends, this is a great place, but if you're wanting an awesome meal, I suggest you go elsewhere.~~#~0
Interesting little coffee shop converted from an old gas station.  I enjoyed the small shaded outdoor seating that is dog friendly.  Muffins, pastries and coffee are good.  Staff were courteous but nothing really stood out about it.  It's not going to be a place I'll ever go out of my way to go to.~~#~0
IHOP - this chain restaurant brings back memories of meals with grandparents and post SAT brunch with friends... or was it OHOP?  I can't remember, but either way, you can't go wrong at IHOP if you're in the mood for breakfast.I happened to pop into this location for a breakfast meeting on Wednesday morning.  My companion and I were probably the only patrons under the age of 65, but that didn't stop us from having a good meal.  I ordered an egg white omelette (yes, they do have egg whites if you ask even though they are not on the menu) and 2 Harvest Nut 'N Grain pancakes.  Yum!  Portion sizes were so humongous that I couldn't even finish more than 1/2 of either item.  The pancakes were delicious - and the waiter brought me margarine instead of butter and a sugar free syrup as well.  I can almost talk myself into believing that this was a guilt free breakfast, but not quite!Service was fine... our waiter was sweet and i was pleased that everything arrived exactly as we ordered it.  3 stars because it's a chain but it's a consistent one at that - I would not hesitate to return!~~#~0
The food here is always good.  I never have had a problem with the food at all.  But the service can be hit or miss sometimes.  I have had great servers that pay attention to us and then we have had horrible servers who seem less than thrilled to be there.~~#~0
The first time I went to 5 guys I hated it but I'm a true believer of 2nd chances.I ordered the double bacon cheeseburger and wasn't disappointed. I mean, nothing memorable, but a pretty decent taste for a decent price.The service was really good and the best is the Coke machine that has tons of flavors. Got to love it!~~#~0
Dave's Dog House makes unique, tasty hot dogs. They have a delightful, back-east bun that's more like a piece of thick, foldable toast. The dogs are high quality and flavorful, and priced well. The fries are alright, but sadly nothing to write home about. They've since moved ON campus, just off the Gammage Parkway loop, so it's a bit trickier to get to from Mill during school, but they're a much better dog than some of the other options available on Mill.~~#~0
10/22/2010 Five Star Fries The food got so much better here when smoking butted out. I sometimes entertain ideas about what I'd recommend in Phoenix to a foreign visitor. I get up on my little cerebral stage, crack a few bad puns to make the ideas groan then sing old school fight songs and "Semper Paratus" in my off-key bass. A good idea is hard to entertain, especially with talents like mine. There are some slicked out burger spots, like a ducktail flattop haircut. Stainless steel diamond-grid walls, the obligatory Marilyn Monroe "Some Like it Hot" subway skirt blowing pic. A framed graphic of a '57 Chevy with LED's for headlights. Jukeboxes in malt-shop booths. These would be fun and interesting to many burger-seeking visitors from afar. Great pictures home from the phone, Elvis singing "Blue Suede Shoes" for a quarter, a chocolate shake from real scooped ice cream like hardly anyone makes in eateries these days.  Like the 1950's on stage.  I'm thinking I'd advise my imaginary visitors stop by the Original Hamburger Works. There's considerable menu variety: chicken, fish, even veggie for the soy-lovers among us. Whatever amount of flattened ground beef you want is grilled amid dancing flames before your eyes, exactly how done you want it, then sandwiched twixt your choice of a whole-wheat, regular or onion bun. If you need a beverage, the full service bar and it's flat-panel entertainment buddies straddle the worlds of indoor and outdoor tables. The out door patio is punctuated by winter fire-pits. The indoor tables are close to the carbonated all-you-can-guzzle soft drink bar.   Iced tea, Texas sweet, green or regular standing by, wait to be cool. Back in burger land and the fixins buffet, you get to make up your sandwich with fresh lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, onions and?  Cute little cups are fillable with catsup for the phenomenal hand-cut fries.  If you're a fry sauce kind of human, there's thousand island, mustard, mayonnaise and relish for immediate use or custom-mixing.  Plus a small salad bar, only if you pay for one. Hamburger Works was doing this long before the slick 12 dollar do-it-yourself burger chains were conceived. As other reviewers mention, it's full of all sorts of old signs and Phoenician memorabilia. The wood-paneled walls have been nicotined and burger-sooted to the patina of Shakespeare's favorite pub.  If your a museum-gazer kind of person, your eyes will never rest.   It's a low-cost college eatery and bar crossed with a neighborhood hangout I once inhabited - the Snug Saloon.  Without beer kegs seats and cable-spool tables at the Original Hamburger Works.  It's more civilized.  Simply an original, Arizona American burger kind of place appealing to every age, family, and walk of life. That's why I entertain ideas of why I'd recommend this place to visitors from anywhere. It's a unique institution at Thomas and 15th Ave.  Plus there's stores adjacent, open evening hours, with all the swag visitors and home decorators love to investigate and buy. For now, from me, to visitors, I'd recommend the Original Hamburger Works~~#~0
I recommend this place to anyone who is new to Arizona, or anyone loves the "Old Western" feel. This place is cool.It is small western town off the road, and is free to enter. There are different buildings, most of which are restaraunts and gift shops. The prices are reasonable, and I did not find any ridiculous merch at high price. I saw a couple of "no photography" signs yet everyone is taking photos, even us! So I recommend bring along a camera since you'll be able to grab some great photos.The only reason why I give this place three stars is because it's pretty far out of the valley. If you like hiking the trails over near Superstition, and Apache Junction then be sure to stop by!~~#~0
I have never had hand pulled noodles before so i ordered it in both the beef stew soup i ordered which was okay. Also in the fried chicken noodles i had ordered. The noodles were tasty but i suggest cutting them a bit so its a little easier to eat.  What i happened to love the most out of our full order was the fried pot stickers and the sauce that came with it was amazing!! i cant wait to go back to order more of the pot stickers and try their boba smoothies and milk tea because i love GOOD boba spots worth going too. upon arriving i could tell they seemed irritated i had come last minute. i personally am not a fan of staying later than what avg store hours are because i know how it feels.  But only thing was that it was probably half an hour before closing time! i understand you want to go home, everyone does! but to make me feel rushed is not a benefit to your establishment IMO.  I will give it another go one of these days but not just yet.~~#~0
Went for a quick visit yesterday and found the library to be less beautiful and less tranquil than when I visited it w/ family a few months ago.  This time it was full of noisy children, both outdoors and in...  I mentioned this observation to a librarian after waiting for her to finish discussing w/ another librarian how a group of unruly children must be addressed (they'd been warned twice already), and she told me that the best times to visit is in the mornings and evenings.  Basically, if you want peace and quiet and a lot of productivity, then avoid this library from 220p (when nearby middle school lets out) and 5-6p (when the children are picked up by their parents/caregivers).  There are study rooms that are first come, first serve (free to use), plus meeting rooms that are available (for a "nominal" fee).  You may either sign up at the help desk, or access the registration form online.  There is also an area at the back that is strictly no talking, no cell phone usage.  It was a very nice change of pace from the rest of the library.There is a vending machine that dispenses snacks and coffee, or so I'm told by another librarian (there was also a posted sign of "SNACKS" pointing somewhere), but I didn't find it during our very quick walk around the facility.  I wish there were better signage outside directing people on how to exit to the main roads.  It's easy to get lost in the twists and turns exiting out, since the area is right next to a school, a preserve and an aquatic center (!!), and their parking lots.~~#~0
I probably should be there right now instead of writing a review.As gyms go this place offers what most people need but not what every one wants. It has free weights, machines, and cardio equipment and a single activities room with a few classes.  It makes up for the lack of extras with the low price.My biggest complaints are the new hours, they close at 10pm on weekdays which is too early and 7pm on weekends again too early. Another problem is the upkeep of some machines and items, many machines and other work out aids could use replacement or repair.The high turnover in staff is ok as the replacements usually seem to be pretty nice. I have been going here for 8 years now so it can't be too bad.~~#~0
Great place to eat, great atmosphere, awesome happy hour but the food  is lacking authenticity which is why it only gets 3 stars from me.~~#~0
I jumped in here for a quick bite on an errand-filled lunch hour.  The burger and fries were bland and unremarkable.  Kinda a bad place for a mediocre joint, since Lenny's is right around the corner, and lots of other burger joints are just a mile away.  Better than a standard chain fast food place, but not by much.~~#~0
Decent hotel spot, but nothing more than that. Could use some upgrade attention. 2.6 starsCost to worth it rating: 3 (got a package with a flight on expedia)Highlights:- Location: right downtown by the ballpark and a few restaurants- Bars and restaurants on premise: they are just ok but at least available if you want something easy- Southwestern benedict: delicious concoction with poached egg, guacamole, fried tomato, on top of a biscuit and covered in a chili hollandaise. A classic gone spicy--loved it! We had it on the 2nd floor cafe, but you can get it for room service as well.- Comfy bed     - Glass elevator: kinda fun especially for kids- Flight check I'm computer: at the front desk so you can print out your boarding passesMidlights:- Random sculpture art: acrobatic bunnies and small headed big men and such all around Lowlights:- Pool: small and weak, only 3 ft within the entire thing, area surrounding pool not very pleasant. Also drink menus on each table but no drink service--kind of odd.- Business center: only for people on the 7th floor- Wireless: available but fee per 24 hrs- Outdated look to the place - Not sure if it was just cause of the music conference, but the hotel as a whole smelled like pot Not much to say about it but it was where our friends were staying. Next visit, I'll probably stay elsewhere.~~#~0
It was around 6pm on my third day in Phoenix when I was (finally) able to hang out and catch up with two dearly-missed SBC alums, Lynn W and Claire! Originally, we'd set out for the dessert place next door, but I had just returned from a 10-hour day trip out to Grand Canyon and back so a slice of pizza sounded perfect...The joint looks very collegiate and indie, full of simple designs, bright colors, and decisive lack of branding, although further inspection reveals it to be a widespread, though not yet prominent franchise.For just shy of $20, I ordered three slices and drinks for our impromptu dinner, myself gravitating towards the simple pesto slice, as usual.For the price per slice, it seems a tad on the expensive side, but the slice, its flavor and ingredients, is decent. The better option or deal is probably to get one of the heartier sounding whole pizzas [online menu: http://weborder3.microworks.com/zpizza/Item.aspx?menuid=2477]  Nonetheless, it hit the spot and service was very friendly.There's a cool symbiosis of Z Pizza being immediately attached and sharing a space with Pink Spot next door.___________________________________________Savory and sweet in a single space! Gluttony abounds!~~#~0
When my sister was visiting a month or so ago, she was craving authentic, cheap Thai from a place that features a lunch special. I hadn't tried Swaddee or Thai Lahna yet, so I decided to take her to Benjarong, where my husband and I had had a pretty good experience the first time. Well, on my second visit, one thing was better - the prices. The lunch specials were only $5.95 and included a delicious little chicken in coconut broth soup and an egg roll. However, I have to say the food was not as great as I remembered it being. Maybe it's just that Swaddee and Thai Lahna have such flavorful and authentic main dishes, or maybe the chef was having an off day, but my sister and I found both of our dishes (curry and Pad See Ew) to be pretty bland and really greasy. We both left feeling a little full and kind of gross. I still think that this is a good spot for cheap, decent Thai if you're in Mesa, but I wouldn't make the drive for it after our second experience.~~#~0
I rolled on in for my first time for lunc today and nowI really have mixed fellings. My Roll did taste good, but anything covered in spicy mayo would. I like the brown rice, but the complete lack of artisan craftmanship with the rice, icrean scoops used for fish and cutting leave me unimpressed.My real quandry is when it comes to value. ~7 for a sushi roll is not a bad price (or a great one) but for lunch $7 for a seat your self type place is on par however one sushi roll is not really filling enough for me.  Thus the 3 stars based on my ability to feel full after a roll + miso soup (.99).Service ws fast friendly and helpful. I liked the idea of soy sauce in a iced tea like despencer. If you are not too hungry, and want a fast lunch that can be somewhat healthy give this place a try.~~#~0
I have only been here during happy hour.  But the food was good and the service was exceptional.  I also got to use a yelp deal.  I may try it again if I am in the area.~~#~0
Ok, so I recieved a gift certificate to this place from my boss, who has been seeing Kristen for years.  She has her own little spa place, and I finally got my appointment, and booked myself a facial for Saturday.But, as I write this review, I have a few reservations on what angle to take with this whole thing.   Please read on and please draw your own conclusions.For starters, a formal complaint-getting ahold of Kristen was darn near impossible.  She did return all my calls, but I never had an actual conversation with her until I set foot in her spa.  voicemail, after voicemail, just to schedule an appointment.  I admit, if I didnt have this gift certificate, I would have never bothered going to her salon, out of the mere fact that I had a hard time getting ahold of her.  out here, it feels like spas are a dime a dozen, so its not like she's the only one in town.Secondly, her place was nearly impossible to find.  I mapquested her, AND went off her directions on the back of her packet thingy, and still had difficulty finding it.  Even my boss said to leave early as she is tucked away in a hard to find spot.  I have been to old town before, but shes in a part that was difficult to find.  I cant hold it against her, but it added to the frustration of her A) not answering the phone, and B) being in a hard to find spot.Finally, after getting to my appointment, I walked in and loved what I did see.  She has a great little lobby setup, relaxing and very inviting.  Lots of product to look at, clean, organized with all the stuff that makes a spa fun and relaxing.Kristen definately knows what she is doing. I was impressed with her knowledge, and she gave lots of advice.  She uses what appears to be a lot of high end products, and clearly is familiar with what works.  Even though I booked a minifacial, it lasted an hour.  I got a neck and shoulder message, parafin for my hands, along with serveral other treatments.Despite the frustration that I experienced getting ahold of her and finding the place, I found Kristen to be professional, knowledgeable, and worth the trouble I had initially.  Even though I do not get facials often, I do plan on returning to see her again for future spa visits.~~#~0
I went last Fri 8th, when Johnny Antezana and dj 40ford were in charge of the night. Music was good if you are a TRUE TRANCE lover...I had a great time dancing. Place is small and for the first hour I was glad most of the posers left enough space to dance.Even it is small for a club, I'm ok with the decoration. Beer selection is AWFUL, but guess it is cos regular party goers drink what ever. Other than that...I miss old good days when electronic music was underground and valued....not here! bunch of douchebags and helpless drunk ladies.~~#~0
College hottie servers and spring break in Mexico atmosphere.  I am sure this place starts jumping well after I have left.  Looks like every bar did in every college town in the late 80s and 90s that I have ever done damage in.~~#~0
I met an associate here at this location for a light snack. (his suggestion)Schlotzsky's Deli is typical of order up at the counter or call in and pick up your food place.  There is indoor and outdoor seating and the setting is somewhat busy in appearance.  The kind of place to pick up something to bite on quick and get moving.  Location is very central to Phoenix Proper  and while you are there ordering or snacking, there are several internet stations set up to go onto the World Wide Web if that is your desire. I didn't care much for what I had ordered (Toasted---Turkey & GuacamoleSmoked turkey breast and guacamole with red onion, lettuce and tomato on toasted Wheat bread. Contains milk, soybeans and wheat.)  I guess I just don't care for toasted sandwiches(personal preference---same feeling about any Quiznos sandwiches!)  This was my first visit to this deli...I'm pretty sure it will be my last, I found the place boring.I give it one star for location, one for the internet access, and one for outdoor seating.---The rest?---Well, you fill in the blanks!~~#~0
Food is good but service was slow but the people was good~~#~0
I go here often for just one thing---The Menudo!  It is a Mexican version of Vietnamese Fau(sp?) Soup.  I get all the fixin's with it: red pepper flakes, oregano, lemon wedges, chopped onions, and cilantro!  Mixed all together and spoon away!  They ask you if you want corn or four tortillas...I get the corn, which adds more flavor to the experience, then a bland flour tortilla will.  Menudo at this restaurant, is served all through the week, though typically at other Mexican food restaurants, it is served primarily on Saturday and Sunday...Not sure why?The seating can hold large parties of up to thirty or more or a comfy couple....The setting is strangely old, and on Sundays there is a Mariachi band that comes around and woos you to another time and space in Mexicana Latin Style and flair!Parking is a pain, so be ready to walk a distance from the parking garage.  Service is so-so....You have to sometimes hunt down the waiter for coke refills....~~#~0
I would give this location 5 stars...fast drive through and my drink was delicious!  However, I don't know how me ordering a raspberry peach iced tea warrants an attitude and opinion.  Girl at the drive thru questioned me twice when I was ordering and then made a comment to me that my order was "weird".  Flavored teas are known to be mixed...try it before you knock it! ;-)~~#~0
The shops are great and the mall is very clean! One of my top favorite malls.~~#~0
Nice little place with decently good service.  I have only tried the pizza here.  It was mediocre.  Nothing great nothing bad, falls into the abyss of average.  I'm not even sure if I would like to return some day to try something other than pizza.~~#~0
I definitely liked this place, but there are a few reasons why i had to give it 3 stars instead of the 4 I initially intended on giving.  I'll get the negative out of the way now so I can end on a good note.  First of all, the layout is just kind of silly.  I totally understand that this is an olllldddd building, so you work with what you're given.  That being said, the entrance/exit is too small and the condiment line backs up into that exit.  It's really frustrating that people feel some need to create a single file line to get sodas, napkins, utensils and condiments when really, there is A LOT of room to share.  It's a really long condiment bar!  Second of all it's way out there for us.  Living in Downtown Phoenix makes the trek out to Gilbert pretty rough sometimes.  Finally, they wouldn't let me sub a smaller version of the green bean fries for regular fries, even though I was willing to pay more than the normal sub fee.On to the good... The grilled cheese I got was really yummy.  It was made with really thick Texas Toast style bread, had some great cheese on the inside, and it was toasted/grilled just right.  It was a very hearty grilled cheese!  The green bean fries that I wanted just a single sized portion of turned out to be like 3 pounds piled high in a basket!  They were really good and garlicky, and for only 5 bucks a great value.  However, I really just wanted enough for myself because as it turns out, I continued eating them until I made myself sick. Overall, I liked the place, but it seems to be constantly busy and I just don't like getting crowded when I'm trying to eat a nice relaxing meal outside.~~#~0
Sooo I went here with a friend who is well...older...than me. As soon as I waked through the door people were staring at me like I was a sugarbaby. Looking around it didn't seem so uncommon. It didn't help that my friend decided to squeeze into my side of the booth. The bartender nearly chocked when I ordered a glass of wine and took a look at my ID. Anyways....never really into the whole scottsdale scene.  The wine suggestion was superb and service was great. Cornbread was ok didn't live up to the hype. I got the salmon and it was tasty. All in all just didn't live up to the hype. Oh well...good place to bring a sugardaddy lol. Just Kidding!~~#~0
Best way to describe this place is average.  If you looking for breakfast they serve it here but dont expect much.  The place is old and everything about it is simply average.  Im bummed it wasnt better as i was really trying to support the local business here in this up and coming downtown.I wont be back...Sorry?~~#~0
Had the 1/2 rack pork rib dinner.Ribs, cowbrow beans and coleslaw.  All good to very good but not make a special trip for.  Tables, settings were minimalist but ok.Rest room was probably less than miniamilst.Will try other places if I am in the mood for barbecue.~~#~0
I enjoyed the food. The  smokey smell in the restaurant was nice and made it feel like they actually smoked their meats. I would go back and enjoy their food again. I think their are a lot of "OK" BBQ places around. I have not been wowed yet. Still looking though. Notorious PIG is a great name and a good place for BBQ.~~#~0
Well let me start by saying i agree with all of the reviews i have read already...but let me start with one obvious problem i have always had with buffet style restaurants...THE CARPET....UHHHHHH!!!!!! I mean if these establishment are going to have carpet in a public area with kids present and people generally eating like kids...then you must pay close attention to the CARPET!!!!. The CARPET had a horrible smell at this location...and you really have to be careful not to let it ruin your appetite.Secondly for the $25 price tag...if your not going for some sort of special...like the all you can eat ribs....which no one else does...then it may not be worth your money. This evening...because my wife loves ribs...is why we even went to pay this establishment a visit. Now don't get me wrong the food is very good...not great...but very good. I had a fabulous piece of rotisserie chicken breast with mashed potatoes and gravy...mac and cheese....and dinner rolls. My wife had the ribs of course.... along with various sides.Now the dessert is not so great or very good for that matter. I had the lemon tart....brownie...and vanilla-chocolate swirl yogurt...and all of them were awful. My wife had the lemon cake and vanilla ice cream along with some fresh strawberries and she seemed to enjoy it.Now in conclusion i don't have to go here again personally...but if a special deal comes to this establishment and you really like it you should definitely give it a shot....otherwise pay your $25 to eat somewhere else. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my friends!!!!~~#~0
It is May people! To have a swimming pool in Phoenix Arizona look as dilapidated as this is unacceptable. I went out to the pool for 5 minutes and turned right back around. The room is like any other Marriott room, awesome bed and pillows, as usual. Room service food was very good and prompt.~~#~0
Lots of fun - great deck in the AZ Spring temps, and a great location on Mill Ave.  The service is a bit slow if you want a server, but if you get your own drinks then not bad.  Also, a bit pricy.~~#~0
I am torn on this review, because I want to rate two things at once.  On one hand, the atmosphere is, I think, pretty good.  The restaurant is cute and has good lighting, and the pianist who plays on Saturdays (and I think another day) is phenomenal.  She does play a lot of "crowd-pleasers," the kind that entertain grandparents, but you can tell that she is very, very talented.  She can take a song that's currently airing on the radio and turn it into a beautiful piano piece.  Unfortunately, the atmosphere is where the "good" part of the review ends.  They have an ok wine and beer selection, but it's overpriced and could be better.  Their food is way below par.  Also overpriced, it looks like their menu just went through an overhaul (to a more expensive menu.)  The bruschetta options have descriptions similar to those at Postino, but trust me, they are done better at Postino.  I've had a few of their sandwiches, but haven't yet discovered anything really that worthy of mention.  It's a shame because they could be really awesome if they had good (and fairly priced) food.~~#~0
I've been to Taiwan once already, and am heading back there again in a few months.  Mostly, I adore the night market fare.  The menu here had me soooo excited.  I was with my fiancee, and we ordered the fried squid, tan tan mien, scallion pancake, and a cup of milk tea.  The milk tea and squid were very close to what we had at the markets.  However, I was extremely disappointed in noodles.  I'm not Taiwanese, but of the many times that I have ordered this dish, it has been spicy.  This was not...it lacked much of any flavor.  The scallion pancakes served only as a belly filler.  I may return, b/c there are so many other dishes to try, but will not be repeating any of my last order.~~#~0
I like the pho here because it isn't as oily as some others I have had.  Everything at Tea Light Cafe seems lighter than the normal Vietnamese fare, however, it is a nice alternative considering the area.~~#~0
This was my first time here to the Phoenix, AZ area and wanted to try something other than Mexican food.  I choose CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe as it was an interesting place and I was in the mood for Ramen.  I had the Spicy Lettuce Wrap with Shrimps & Vegetables to start.  It was good but I do not see how anyone could eat it as a wrap...very messy (I ended up putting the lettuce in the bowl and ate it with a spoon).  For the main dish, I orded the Ramen TanTan-Men.  The Ramen, I would have to say was pretty good and was enough to fill you up.  Over all I would rate this place 3 stars and I would come back.~~#~0
I noshed on the Zinburger which has manchego cheese, zinfandel braised onions (and they pile the onions on FYI) and mayo which held off on. I ordered sweet potato fries and sipped a diet coke. I would suggest coming here after a night of drinking to cure that nasty hangover. They have tv's all around. Fast service. Really good burgers. My mum ordered the plain and simple burger that had lettuce and tomato. She ordered the hand cut fries and ate most of my sweet potato ones. :)~~#~0
It might have been that I was just hopped up on cold meds, but when I walked in I wasn't sure where I was supposed to start as the primary "Order Here" sign was askew and I missed it--and with no one in line I was momentarily unsure of where to begin my Market Bistro experience.  As my architect friend would say, they need to work on their "welcoming sequence".Once I overcame this small issue I asked about soups of the day (didn't seem to be posted anywhere...nor was the menu but I could of missed it) and none sounded too exciting so I went with the Arizona tri-tip sandwhich.  Once I had sandwhich in hand I proceeded to the cash register which appeared to be the next logical step...but it was unattended.  I suppressed my kleptomatic urge to run with sandwhich in hand, and actually had to track someone down to complete my purchase.  No tip for you!The sandwhich itself was actually pretty good, ciabatta bread, some roasted chilis, not too shabby.  However, if this place struggles with no one in line, 5 employees, and an empty house I would hate to try it on a busy day!  I will say for the same price of a foot long at Subway you can get a quality sandwhich here if you're in the area--just don't expect the slick efficiency of a trained sandwich artist.~~#~0
Having been coming here for a couple of years now.  We like the tacos on Tuesdays (99 cents) but usually order other items.Would not rate this a spectacular place, but for reasonably priced sit down Mexican food - it is pretty good.Has a big selection of items and always busy when we are there.Very clean.~~#~0
went here yesterday for dinner had the special 4 chicken tacos for 6.95 they were good i also ordered a side of beans which were ok no chips are served with the side of beans or in general unless ordered as a side as well~~#~0
I wish I was closer to this place because I would visit more often. This is a great local coffee shop in a neighborhood that is growing.  The coffee and food is great.  My one problem with the place is the parking.  The last time I was in the neighborhood, I had to drive around several times to find a parking.  I love that this is a coffee shop and market.  They offer diverse products that you would not find in other stores.  Check this place out and grab a cup of coffee.~~#~0
Solid lunch spot, a little on the pricey side but classy enough to be ok.~~#~0
It had been quite some time since I'd been to the Good Egg, as my favorite Midtown breakfast spot was always First Watch. Well, I went on probably a 2 year breakfast hiatus and had only been to a couple of places (I'm a night owl.) After my last visit to First Watch indicated it had completely gone down hill, it was time to try a new place. The Good Egg it is. In contrast to First Watch, The Good Egg is spectacular. I ordered a basic breakfast consisting of two eggs over hard, pancakes, and bacon. The eggs were well prepared and I really enjoyed them, the bacon was worlds ahead of most breakfast places with only Matt's and Over Easy really standing out as better, but the pancakes were not really fluffy and light. Overall, I'd say the food quality was above average. Our waitress was very kind and extremely prompt, and performed her job exactly as she should have. I really appreciate getting great service or anymore even decent service makes me happy.What went awry for me was the pricing. They are just a few pennies less than Matt's, and at $7.50 for my aforementioned breakfast, I guarantee it wasn't the same quality as Matt's. I wasn't eating organic cage-free eggs, nor was I consuming Neuske's bacon. I'm sure their rent at Park Central mall is outrageous, but I did find the pricing to be a bit on the high side, and my coffee, though unlimited, was kind of high at $2.25 when most breakfast places are under $2. Overall a good experience, but my $12 bill including tax and tip was kind of a lot for breakfast.~~#~0

So I had just left Sally's in this shopping complex and was on my way to JoAnn's when my Starbucks radar kicked in and I saw this little (literally) shop. I honestly didn't think you could walk-in to this location, I thought it was drive-thru only. However, after I received my drink and started to drive off, someone walked in, lol. So FYI, if you want, you can go in, but you probably can't turn around ;)The lady at the drive-thru was nice and I didn't have to wait long for my delicious beverage.~~#~0
Good burger but kind of expensive as burgers go. The french fries were just so-so, a little greasy. Other than that, ok. Wish they had a drive thru.~~#~0
consistant service.  No bells or whistles to keep me from going out of my way to get to this location.~~#~0
Um.... their dim sum still maintain its quality. However, their regular dishes do not taste that good anymore. I heard that they changed the chef and that could explain why.We stop going there for dinner because of that. Besides, I can get the better quality with lower price from China King, C Fu, Jade House, China Max and Jong Wah.One note is that C Fu offer wider variety of live fish too, it is not only live Tilapia, but also live Sea Bass and another one which I forgot its name.~~#~0
If I was still on the college boat I imagine this would be an "Everybody Knows Your Name" place to wind down the days. I was in the area and wanted to find a new place to eat at.  This was Yelped about highly so I gave it a shot.  Average college hang out, little effort on amenities and full attention to stocked taps and bar specials.  I was expecting a generous variety of Oyster dishes to choose from.  Not many on the menu but the basics so I went with some grilled salmon.  It was topped with crab and I got the sauce on the side.  Crab wasn't so good and I pushed it to the side.  The salmon on the other hand was just the way I like it. Bottom Line -  I did go during happy hour (not purposely) and no one was really eating (except my face) but everyone was drinking and having a good time.  Go there for the booze is my best advice and keep the food in mind as an after thought.  It wasn't bad by all means but it wasn't something I would go out of my way to eat again.Avg dinner price was $20 per person with no drinks.~~#~0
Stopped by for a drink one night after dinner. It was OK. I had the cactus margarita which was really strong on the Midori and cactus juice not much tequila. Which was disappointing as they are known for the 100 different kinds that they carry.  Staff and service was OK but they were distracted by the AZ  Monday night football game. We did not eat so this review is mostly for the bar.~~#~0
We saw the great reviews so figured we'd check it out.  It's an understated place that feels like an einstein's bagel location, not necessarily a bad thing as we go there too.  Ordered a couple of eggs with pork sausage, and 9 grain toast.  The sausage is very tasty.  We also had their green chili corn quiche with pepperjack cheese.  Very good.  The strawberry waffles were pretty good but not great.  Not trying to be too critical but I eat breakfast at a lot of great places and these are good but in line with what many good places will offer.  On the other hand, there are some places that have incredible waffles and french toast, not necessarily in AZ.  Either way, the staff was very good, food came relatively fast, and I would probably go back for a bite.  One little beef is that they should use butter or oil when cooking their eggs.  They use what I like to call fake butter or margarin.  You can always smell it when it's used in cooking eggs.  I know it's cheaper and lasts forever but frankly the other alternatives are just better.  Go check it out and make your own opinions known.~~#~0
Where do I start with Casey Moores? The food is freaking fantastic. I'm from Boston and their clam chowder is in my top 3 favorites. Their fried clam strips are equally awesome. It's a good place to meet up with friends for drinks or even just a place to hang out at all night. It's got an awesome outdoor patio as well. But the service even during the day can be pretty shitty and the bouncers can be equally as shitty. Since it's close to ASU they inspect and reinspect ID's and they have been known to hassle patrons. Another drawback they start carding way early. Most bar/pub/restaurants don't start carding until about 9. I brought a friend for a late dinner once at around 7 and the bouncer was already checking ID's so she couldn't get in. But inside it's usually a pretty good crowd and you'll always see a familiar face.~~#~0
I have lived in this community for 6 months now, and am about to move out. The grounds are well maintained, the staff is friendly, but the buildings are starting to deteriorate. I have had to submit several work orders to get various things fixed throughout my apartment, which has been a bit of a nuisance considering how expensive the rent is. I have been told that another management company will be taking over within the next two months, and that vacant units will be updated. Once updated, these will be a nice place to live due to the excellent location on Rural and Baseline. Rent is a little expensive for the area, especially given that the interiors have not been updated since 1995. If looking to move in, be sure to look into an updated unit to avoid white-washed cabinets and gold fixtures. I LOVE that Whole Foods is across the street, Quik Trip is a stones throw away, and Doc & Eddy's (bar) is within 100 feet from the rear buildings.~~#~0
Pretty good for a decent price.  The rolled taco plate was the special and it was only $4.50.  They came with a topping of quacamole and cheese and they were quite good.  The quesadilla my daughter had was huge and full of nicely melted cheese.  She loved it but then you really can't go too wrong with a quesadilla.  The place was fairly busy with about 5 tables occupied.  It could have been just a bit cleaner in terms of the floor and tables but it was not bad.  They may have just had a rush and not had the chance to come out and clean.  I'll give them benifit of the doubt on that one.  I will go back and try more items on the menu.  They have specials every day and a fairly vaired menu.  It's located in a strip mall next to Starbucks and just down the way is Angel Sweet for dessert.  Overall it was decent.~~#~0
They didn't have my size in hockey skates, which actually worked out ok b/c the size smaller fit fine.  Blades were not sharp, but that's no surprise.  Price was entirely affordable.  I was a little intrigued that the open skate time was only two hours, fairly early, on a Friday night - obviously this place favors the hockey players, not that I have anything against that at all.  Anyway it translated out to a sizeable group of partially drunk Yelpers and Twitterers, a few junior high kids, and families w/ kids.  I didn't run anyone over this time, so that was a bonus.  Fairly cheap, too (my credit card says $8).  I'd do it again, just not all the time.  The location looks a little spooky, but it's really not too bad.~~#~0
I get coffee here several times a week, mainly because I live 'round the corner and can't always justify the drive to Lux ;-)Their WiFi router does not issue IPs smoothly...have patience after 10 minutes you will get one.Drip coffee: pretty good though I do not understand why they can't get wooden stirrers. I always ask for these but end up having to use a big plastic spoon which I assume costs them more. Oh well...Hot Mocha: This would be my winter drink here but SE's is horrible, stay away from it. Tastes like medicine.Mocha Java Frost: This is my main summer drink. I stop in after every bike ride and get one. The one thing is that not all staff members make it consistently. I have actually learned their schedules and avoid the one staffer who can't make this drink correctly. Incidentally she is also the one grouchy staff member. Maybe your ability to make a good Java Frost is directly related to your happiness in life....?~~#~0
Thanks to Derek r.'s review, I thought I'd add my $.02.  It's been awhile since I last dined here (at least a couple of years), as I try to support non-chain restaurants these days, but I enjoyed the few dining experiences here, solo and w/ relatives.  Servers were always friendly and efficient.  Tables, chairs, booths, and women's restroom were clean.If you're one to check out those mailers that arrive in your mailbox from time to time, you'll know that 5 & Diner usually has BOGO offers on there (buy one, get one).   Years ago ('03, '04?), this very location sold, during Christmas season, upcoming new year calendars that had cute 50's theme pics.  Each month's page offered coupons such as BOGO, free children's entree with paying adult, or a free shake w/ an entree.  Does anyone know if this promotion is still running every Christmas season?~~#~0
Not a bad place for dim sum. Have been here several times now. Most of the time it's been satisfactory.~~#~0
Good tandoori chicken.  Skip the bland lamb curry.  Spinach curry was delicious; eat it with basmati rice.  Excellent samosas.  Heavenly gulab jamun.  The carrot squares were delicious, as well.  Wash it all down with chai.  $9 lunch buffet.  Can't wait to try again!~~#~0
I like Ikea for many things and they carry many items difficult to find elsewhere like duvets and duvet covers.    The furniture typically has to be assembled which is easy after you do one of an item.  The first time through is invariably frustrating.The thing I do not like is the crowds.  One can get claustrophobic on the weekends and god forbid you have to go upstream against the flow!  The help they have at the end when you have to find stuff is very hit or miss.~~#~0
I consider myself somewhat of an expert on Mortons.  If I was on island (home), I ate a the Honolulu restaurant every Saturday from Jun 2007 to May 2011.  Since that time the restaurant has been sold to Landrys.So what did I notice today when I went there tonight.  First, Maitre d and manager weren't wearing tuxedos any more.  Given that Landrys recently bought McCormick and Schmicks and closed the Phx location in addition to the Phx Mortons, I think there's a serious change afoot.How does this reflect on quality?  Perhaps to early to say.  But on the other hand cutting away at something as small as management in tuxedos may seem inconsequential, I can guarantee you that there will be 2nd and 3rd order effects that will impact food quality.Now having said all of the above we ate in the bar.  Ordered the sliders, blt crab sandwiches, mini wedge salad and a bowl of lobster bisque.  I was all good reflected pretty much what we had in Hawaii over the last 4 years.  Having said that, I will go out on a limb here and say that if the tuxedo cutting culture makes it's way into the kitchen, then I predict one of the first casualties will be the crab cakes.  Good crab cakes are hard, and expensive to make.  Cheap or Cheaper ones are easier.  But it you're cutting out tuxedos...a very visible sign of the restaurant...it will be very easy to make cheaper crab cakes.~~#~0
(only 3 stars cause' I only been here once)I went here quite awhile ago with some coworkers. The coworkers were two very pretty young ladies, and the waiter was your definition of a 'ladies man', but surprisingly, I still received just as good of service as the gals. I'll make the disclaimer that I don't frequent really nice restaurants like this. You'll find me in a Chinese food buffet more than a place like this. So maybe that's why I enjoyed the ambiance of this place so much. It is quite stylish inside to say the least. Low lights, modern designs, sleek furnishings... This is a bonafide date place. It screams "Your girl will likey likey". Its got that 'in scene' type of feel that I've always dreamed of being a part of, but I'm just too lame to fit into:) Anyway, none of that means anything if the food isn't good. Can't remember what everyone ordered, but I got a burger...dummy! Why would you order such a pedestrian meal at this kind of place?! To make it worse, the burger was very unspectacular. And in my simpleton way of thinking, if you can't get a simple burger right, I have no business trying any of your more ambitious offerings. However, that concept was thrown out the window when one of my coworkers let me taste her sushi stuff. It was AWESOME!!! The taste and freshness were fighting over which would win me over. They both won, cause the taste of whatever that roll was called was something new and exciting for my taste buds, while the freshness of the ingredients was something that just made me smile. I ended up finishing her meal off for her, and vowed that I would be back to order it myself. My other coworker had some type of salad, which was looking rather appetizing. All in all, I think you just have to order the right things...which I guess is the case at any restaurant. As for the service, it was good. The guy managed to flirt his face off with the girls, and provide attentive and prompt service at the same time. Maybe they actually have training for that when you first start here...seems like the place was full of gorgeous girls, so I guess male waiters need to know how to handle themselves. The price? Well, this is a really nice place, so expect to pay a little more. Still, I don't remember being to p'ed off with my bill for the burger and a drink. Decent Chandler type prices, I guess. So yeah, if you got a girl, take her here and be wary of the trained male waiters. Order some of the nicer things on the menu, not a stupid burger. And for us guys who like to wear jeans and a t-shirt, you can do so here...just make sure its a decent t-shirt, one without the set in stains. And bring at least 20 bucks...trust me.~~#~0
OK, I know Benni's is more known for their Teppanyaki but for an uppity Japanese place you'd expect the sushi to be equally as good right? Meh. Not only did it suck, but the selection was limited, they were 'out' of many items, and it was overpriced. I don't recommend it. The company at our table included a young couple celebrating a birthday and an extremely douchey, divorced father/daughter duo that did not stop arguing the ENTIRE time. The girl was huffing and whining about her mercedes not being the model she had hoped for, elbows all over the table. The dad was talking very loud and using profanity, blaming the mom and calling her and the girl insulting names. It took everything in my power not to walk over and politely ask the guy to leave our table because I know it would have escalated. So after a bit the guy picked up on the rest of us at the table looking perturbed and he apologized, but still kept arguing, only a little quieter now. Enter chef: a Mexican fellow with an exotic Latin romance novel name I can't remember. He introduced himself and Julie jokingly asked if his name was Japanese. He laughed and was actually a good sport about it, injecting little bits of hispanic humor throughout the cooking experience...and offered to serve Julie her chicken open-faced or wrapped in a burrito if she preferred :) He wasn't all that impressive with his knife work and tossing tricks which we didn't really care about but it's still expected, especially for the kids (and the price). The food however was cooked to perfection and more than made up for the sub par sushi. He made it a point to give the arguing d-bags sample pieces first so they'd have something to occupy their mouths, and winked at the rest of us which was pretty cool. All in all it was a fairly entertaining evening, and aside from the sushi the rest of the food was awesome. The Saki and Kirin helped take the edge off and toward the end the whole table was talking and being friendly, and we even got to bomb the birthday girl's photo op haha. Btw, if birthday girl or someone that knows her reads this, we would like a copy of that photo!! We tried to download it from the Benihana website but of course they were having 'technical difficulties' with it that night. Hmm I wonder if their sushi chef doubles as their web developer?~~#~0
Umm....  I didn't like it.  Apparently I'm the only one?We went to Sweet Republic last night, drove 30 minutes because 141 reviews and a 5 star rating was reason enough.  I'm a little perplexed by the rating, I keep thinking I must have ordered the wrong flavors?We tried the salted butter carmel, rocky road and malt with chocolate waffle cone.  I didn't really care for any of them.  The flavor was so mild that I felt completely unsatisfied.  So unsatisfied that we ended up leaving and driving to Yogurtology to do the job of filling our sweet tooth.I won't be back...~~#~0
Wild Thaiger was very cozy and inviting. This was my first time eating Thai food so I was looking to have a great experience unfortunately the service or lack there of almost ruined it for me. They were not very busy but it took about 10 minutes for the hostess to seat us. The server took another 15 minutes to take our drink order. The Thai iced tea was really different but very good. We ordered some chicken egg rolls and when they finally came or they were amazing! Our main dishes took forever to come out and it was just ok. I think I like Thai food.but I will not be returning here.~~#~0
I have been living here for almost two years now, when my husband and I first moved in it was great! Everyone in the office was awesome and the maintenance workers really cared. Since Greystar has taken over they are giving incentive to let inconsiderate tenants move in. I have been dreading living here since then. I have complained time and time again about hood rat kids with their subwoofers, drug dealers making deals in broad daylight in front of me! I was flabbergasted when I first saw this happen! Don't get me wrong, the inside of the apartments are very nice, new sinks, stove,refrigerator, and new microwave. Since the management has taken over the new maintenance workers half ass work, the people in the office are rude ( they also have a lady that cannot properly dress, she looks like she's going to the club in her hoochie clothes, instead wearing business attire.) I for one would not recommend this place, they are about to raise the rent to $675.00 a month! This is not worth it! Find somewhere else!~~#~0
Ok, I have to be a stickler on this one. We were looking for a reasonable hike on our day off to get a little exercise and be outdoors in Phoenix while there on vacation. SG checked some other sites for listings, not looking at YELP. If he had, he would have noticed that all the reviews, though highly rated, talk about the high intensity and rocky terrain. The other sites said "easy to moderate". Uh huh, right. So, we found a rock star parking spot on the little street leading up to the park entrance and did not wait for the line to allow one person at a time into the lot. That would have took a half hour on its own. We ventured up and started into the park. Fairly quickly you get into ROCKY terrain with some definite climbing. Ok, so maybe this is just a little bit of the hike. NOPE. Pretty much the whole thing! I really did not have much trouble with going up this mountain. I would not say that I could or would ever want to run it (or do it twice, three times, or 4 times like some of the folks on the trail), but I am in ok shape to breath heavy and keep going. SG on the other hand was not in shape for this mountain. Going down, I was the pokey chicken. I do not like going down. I would rather sweat and breath hard going up all day long. This rocky terrain is treacherous. I myself am too timid for this type of descent. I would have preferred a non rocky hike, even with the elevation gain. Just be warned.~~#~0
The scene was great but the food and drinks were not. I ordered a steak and it came out under cooked and pre sliced. My boyfriend loved his champagne drink but the martini and wine were not good. It's funny that the wine was not good at a place that says they are a wine bar. Will we go back? Maybe, but it won't be our first choice. There are better places downtown that has more consistent food.~~#~0
Great place for happy hour.There's not much going on at City North except for the restaurants and bars.  Kona Grill is the place for decent food and cheap drinks for happy hour.This last visit my friend and I ordered the fried calamari and a Hawaiian pizza.  Both were pretty good and enough to fill us up.The Sam Adams seasonal beer was served in chilled beer glasses which was a nice touch.Sitting at the bar talking with friends, watching TV and having fun people watching is the way to go.~~#~0
First timers with a large party. Everybody liked food and service except the halibut was awful.~~#~0
My friends like The Parlor more than I do. That's not to say it's sub-par, but rather they gush about it so profusely that there's no way it can live up to the hype. (Note: I talk about expectations a lot because it's half the dining experience.)I've had the pizza and the duck club. Both are very good. The setting is nice and the location is about perfect. I like the patio and bar area more than the main dining room.My reasons for a 3 instead of a 4 or higher? The prices strike me as about 15 percent higher than they should be. And the staff has never blown me away. My last waiter was extremely goofy and unapologetically slow, especially since it wasn't even a capacity crowd.The Parlor is one of those places that I'll continue to visit every now and again because a) The experience will probably never be awful; and b) my friends and family often call the shots.Hence, a solid 3-star rating.~~#~0
Fry's really helped me out on a recent trip to Phoenix as I was able to get my natural healthy items that I live on back in Seattle, They had a great stock of Larabars, So delicious coconut milk ice cream and my Bobs Redmill Almond Flour for some snicker Doodles I was hoping to make. What really hurt was their Sushi. I had heard great things about the Sushi bar but when I got there I saw piles and piles of prepackaged rolls and nagiri. As I looked over the ingredients, there was nothing but Whey, Lecithin's more preservatives that do not belong in sushi. Sushi should be "Fresh." I'm not a fan of conveyor belt establishments, and even less excited to grab a plastic clamshell ToGo box. Needless to say, I am still fending for a great place to grab Sushi while in Phoenix. HELP!!!~~#~0
Chaos, but in a good way.~~#~0
went there last night, after a rotten day and dinner at La Bocca. fairly good band playing, quite the indie scenester crowd(a bit irritating, but pretty much what I expected). $4.50 for a Jack and diet coke is...pretty f**king steep, but I still bought three and left feeling pretty good.~~#~0
Last night I tweeted asking for dinner recommendations in the Gilbert area.  I did get a few responses thanks to @ericeatsout and @lynnekingsmith, but we were actually pretty far out in the middle of nowhere, so we ended up finding our way to Pho Ao Sen on our way home instead.  The restaurant itself is clean and has an upscale feel to it compared to most of the other Vietnamese restaurants in town.  Service was friendly, but we found the menu a bit limited and the quality of the meat not amazing.  We started with the (#2)Goi Cuon- Spring Roll appetizer (minus the pork).  They came out quickly and were really good.  For our entrees, I had the (#7) Korean style beef short ribs and Jared went for the (#21) Pho Ga (aka Chicken Noodle Soup).  We both agreed entrees were just alright.  I also had a coconut juice beverage which I later learned came from a can.  Bottom line: Is this place "simply PHO'nomenal" as their tagline says?  Not so much... and we probably won't be rushing back anytime soon, but it was A-OK.~~#~0
I chose BLT for my birthday dinner a few weeks ago. We were given a  table with an excellent view and our server started off great. He recommended a few different cocktails and told us about the daily specials. The popovers were amazing and I loved that they gave us the recipe to them. I'm eager to try and recreate these masterpieces in my own kitchen.My oysters were fresh, the sides we chose (the asparagus and the Potato Gratin) were both were excellent. The only problem was our steaks were barely luke warm when we received them. They were cooked to our preferences, but both were almost cold. We attempted to send them back but it seemed at that point our waiter disappeared. After several minutes of trying to make eye contact with someone working we decided to just eat before the rest of our food got cold. I had great expectations for BLT, unfortunately the cold steaks and lackluster service at the end will not justify a return visit. I'm still going with 3 stars, because steaks aside everything else was great.~~#~0
While the store was a bit disheveled as we walked through it, they had some pretty awesome sales going on plus I was able to print a couple of good coupons online, so my savings were pretty fantastic.  :) I usually like to walk through aisles and browse through items without having to step over piles of things or worry that item dangling from the top shelf will fall and injure me in some freak craft accident.   However, the service I received both times I visited the store this week from the framing department was phenomenal!  I am pretty bummed I didn't catch either of the staff member's names who assisted me as I would like to give them the proper shout-out.  They were very helpful, knowledgeable and went through some extra effort to meet my deadline. (Yes, I had a deadline for a frame.  Please don't judge me.)  All in all, I would return to this store to check out their store clearance items and for framing.  All else (scrapbooking, baking, etc.) would be a "maybe".~~#~0
I don't really like going to this theater because it's conjoined to not only a huge mall but also game works. But, alas, you can bet you'll find a parking space - you just may have to walk a little bit. The theater is clean, easy to find and plays the hottest new releases.I saw Spider Man 3 here at opening day, midnight. I expected alot more of a snafu, but it was efficient enough that my friend and I got some really great seats - never mind having our butts go numb from sitting for 5 hours. I've been back since the premiere. It's a very easy place to find (so close to my place) so I think that's why I go.~~#~0
Is this place full of douchebags?  OF COURSE it is, it's Scottsdale.That being said, this place consistently brings world class DJ's (Donald Gladue anyone? DJ Icey... hello?) that you won't find anywhere else in Phoenix and a good deal for $10 before 11pm or whatever it is.  Usually the morons there don't realize the talent that's behind the decks so there is a decent amount of room on the dance floor... plus it never gets old watching people "freak" to dirty breakbeats.  lol.  idiots.Yeah drinks are pricey, but nothing compared to $14-$18 vodka tonics in Los Angeles... plus we're ghetto and usually bring a flask in anyway.  But then again, I'm not there to socialize or drink, I'm there to hear good music.The downstairs lounge area is perfect when you need to chill out and I never have a problem finding a seat.  Even though there are usually "Reserved" place cards on the tables I just assume they're reserved for me and have never been hassled.I wish they had some dope drum'n'bass acts there, but I always wish that of every place and it never comes true.~~#~0
When Yupha's used to be on Elliott and Hardy their prices were lower and the portions were bigger.  Now they are at Elliott and McClintock, and with the move came a price hike along with a reduction in the amount of food they served.  For me, they have priced themselves out of my regular rotation.  The food is still tasty enough when I am in the area, but I wouldn't make a special trip.~~#~0
I thought the place was okay, but nothing tremendously special. The crew at Modavox swears by this place for delivery (well some of them anyway). I needed to get out of the office on a recent visit so I decided to drive over to them in Tempe. I had a nice talk with the young guy, who may have been the owner. He was very interested when I told him I was from San Diego. He wants to open one of these over there. I think he might have a good chance, although there are many similar and better places already.I got the California sandwich, being from California, of course. (Turkey, Swiss, sprouts, tomato, avocado) It normally comes with mayo but I substituted mustard. The sandwich was actually much better priced for a foot-long than many other places. The place was very contemporary but I felt the sandwich was just okay. I also got chips, but bagged chips is bagged chips no no review necessary. Would I go again? Maybe.~~#~0
Husband and I tried Joey's on a Friday evening. We both had the Italian Beef, wet, with mozzarella cheese, mine with sweet peppers. It was good...decent...nothing spectacular. The beef was seasoned well and very tender. We ordered them 'wet' because that's what the sign said they recommend, but personally, I am a fan of au jus, so I should have had it dipped. The fries were thin and crispy. Yum. We will be back, but it probably won't become one of our go-to places.~~#~0
Sort of fast food, but fresher...and a little more tasty.Things to know:  -When you order a Cheeseburger, it's automatically a double patty. If you want something smaller (a single), order a "Little Cheeseburger." -Contrary to how small the cup looks, a Regular fries will definitely feed 2 people because they dump all kinds of extra fries in the bag too.  -The burgers are MESSY...but I kind of liked it. They were messy-good.Overall, Five Guys is solid. I enjoyed my burger, and the fries were done well too. However, I still can't see myself going out of my way to return very often.~~#~0
A solid three stars, I think! No, it's NOT the authentic Hakata-style ramen I crave but it's not the 25cent kind either! The noodles are REALLY well done and the broths (tonkatsu, spicy tonkatsu and the shoyu) were very tasty and full of flavor. The toppings in the traditional style leave a lot to be desired and the pork is NOT chashu-style.The boba drinks are nice and the service was pretty good. Overall, I'd give them another try.~~#~0
With 130 food items on the menu, there's plenty to choose from. I went with the BBQ pork fried rice. What I got was an enormous portion of fried rice with pork - definitely enough to satisfy my hunger. Not the greatest food around, but good enough to come back and sample some of the other 129 items.  And with prices hovering around the $5-6 range, it's very affordable.~~#~0
Saturday's trip made it out second to Lenny's.  The burger I had had WAY too much mayo on it.  Fries were good.  J liked his chili cheese dogs.  If we're ever in the area again, we'll probably go again.  And I'll probably try a different buger - and tell them to go easy on the mayo.~~#~0
Federico's has been the 24hr place to eat in this neighborhood for as long as i can remember.  The portions are large and they have a help your self salsa bar.  My wife likes to get the cheese quesadia and i like to get the Carnitas burito.  The place is clean and the food is decent. What more can you ask for in a fast food Mexican joint.~~#~0
I'm not a big "breakfast" fan so it sways my rating a bit.  This place was really crowded when I went.  Overall it was good, the best I've found in PHX so far.  If I was looking for breakfast I'd go back.~~#~0
I went here on a Groupon NOW promotion and when I went it, the owner explained to me they were not honoring the Groupon which was kind of annoying cause now I have to get my money refunded through Groupon and she didn't offer any sort of discount to compensate.I wanted to try it out regardless and I'm glad I stuck around.  The food is made fresh and is GOOD. Honest, good, healthy and good.  They were running low on staff when we went but the owner came out and apologized.We had the chips and guac, which was ok.The salads were good.  I had the Beijing with Chicken, my friend got the Athenian and the bf got the tacos.All parties were pleased and it's inexpensive to boot.~~#~0
Delux, seriously. It's well-done. The kitchen stays open until 2am and the Grilled Cheese is out of this "californian cuisine" galaxy. I had to switch from the Delux Burger because I think it stopped my heart for a few seconds in my sleep the night I decided to take it all in. I'm usually just here for the beer anyways and it's not bad with 17+ on tap.No can do on Friday/ Saturday night. The wait will be an hour. Yes, still. Shut up you CenPho/ Biltmore trendsters.... oh wait.~~#~0
Disappointing. Rock Bottom has all the makings of a quality bar and grill but just doesn't deliver quite like I thought it would.At places like this, I have two main expectations: 1) Good beer with lots of it on tap. 2) Good bar food. And it goes one for two. The beer is tasty and cold, as it should be, but the bar food didn't do it for me. Burgers are a little awkward, think greasy bar burgers with bleu cheese. It just didn't float my boat. The service is always good and it's a better place to drink than to eat, even the desserts and appetizers are good, just not an all-around contender for favorite bar and grill.~~#~0
